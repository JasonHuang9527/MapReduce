Book
01	Genesis
001:001
In
the
beginning
God
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth.
001:002
And
the
earth
was
without
form,
and
void;
and
darkness
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep.
And
the
Spirit
of
God
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
waters.
001:003
And
God
said,
Let
there
be
light:
and
there
was
light.
001:004
And
God
saw
the
light,
that
it
was
good:
and
God
divided
the
light
from
the
darkness.
001:005
And
God
called
the
light
Day,
and
the
darkness
he
called
Night.
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
first
day.
001:006
And
God
said,
Let
there
be
a
firmament
in
the
midst
of
the
waters,
and
let
it
divide
the
waters
from
the
waters.
001:007
And
God
made
the
firmament,
and
divided
the
waters
which
were
under
the
firmament
from
the
waters
which
were
above
the
firmament:
and
it
was
so.
001:008
And
God
called
the
firmament
Heaven.
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
second
day.
001:009
And
God
said,
Let
the
waters
under
the
heaven
be
gathered
together
unto
one
place,
and
let
the
dry
land
appear:
and
it
was
so.
001:010
And
God
called
the
dry
land
Earth;
and
the
gathering
together
of
the
waters
called
he
Seas:
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good.
001:011
And
God
said,
Let
the
earth
bring
forth
grass,
the
herb
yielding
seed,
and
the
fruit
tree
yielding
fruit
after
his
kind,
whose
seed
is
in
itself,
upon
the
earth:
and
it
was
so.
001:012
And
the
earth
brought
forth
grass,
and
herb
yielding
seed
after
his
kind,
and
the
tree
yielding
fruit,
whose
seed
was
in
itself,
after
his
kind:
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good.
001:013
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
third
day.
001:014
And
God
said,
Let
there
be
lights
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
divide
the
day
from
the
night;
and
let
them
be
for
signs,
and
for
seasons,
and
for
days,
and
years:
001:015
And
let
them
be
for
lights
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
give
light
upon
the
earth:
and
it
was
so.
001:016
And
God
made
two
great
lights;
the
greater
light
to
rule
the
day,
and
the
lesser
light
to
rule
the
night:
he
made
the
stars
also.
001:017
And
God
set
them
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
give
light
upon
the
earth,
001:018
And
to
rule
over
the
day
and
over
the
night,
and
to
divide
the
light
from
the
darkness:
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good.
001:019
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
fourth
day.
001:020
And
God
said,
Let
the
waters
bring
forth
abundantly
the
moving
creature
that
hath
life,
and
fowl
that
may
fly
above
the
earth
in
the
open
firmament
of
heaven.
001:021
And
God
created
great
whales,
and
every
living
creature
that
moveth,
which
the
waters
brought
forth
abundantly,
after
their
kind,
and
every
winged
fowl
after
his
kind:
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good.
001:022
And
God
blessed
them,
saying,
Be
fruitful,
and
multiply,
and
fill
the
waters
in
the
seas,
and
let
fowl
multiply
in
the
earth.
001:023
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
fifth
day.
001:024
And
God
said,
Let
the
earth
bring
forth
the
living
creature
after
his
kind,
cattle,
and
creeping
thing,
and
beast
of
the
earth
after
his
kind:
and
it
was
so.
001:025
And
God
made
the
beast
of
the
earth
after
his
kind,
and
cattle
after
their
kind,
and
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
after
his
kind:
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good.
001:026
And
God
said,
Let
us
make
man
in
our
image,
after
our
likeness:
and
let
them
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea,
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air,
and
over
the
cattle,
and
over
all
the
earth,
and
over
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth.
001:027
So
God
created
man
in
his
own
image,
in
the
image
of
God
created
he
him;
male
and
female
created
he
them.
001:028
And
God
blessed
them,
and
God
said
unto
them,
Be
fruitful,
and
multiply,
and
replenish
the
earth,
and
subdue
it:
and
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea,
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air,
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth.
001:029
And
God
said,
Behold,
I
have
given
you
every
herb
bearing
seed,
which
is
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth,
and
every
tree,
in
the
which
is
the
fruit
of
a
tree
yielding
seed;
to
you
it
shall
be
for
meat.
001:030
And
to
every
beast
of
the
earth,
and
to
every
fowl
of
the
air,
and
to
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth,
wherein
there
is
life,
I
have
given
every
green
herb
for
meat:
and
it
was
so.
001:031
And
God
saw
every
thing
that
he
had
made,
and,
behold,
it
was
very
good.
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
sixth
day.
002:001
Thus
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
finished,
and
all
the
host
of
them.
002:002
And
on
the
seventh
day
God
ended
his
work
which
he
had
made;
and
he
rested
on
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
work
which
he
had
made.
002:003
And
God
blessed
the
seventh
day,
and
sanctified
it:
because
that
in
it
he
had
rested
from
all
his
work
which
God
created
and
made.
002:004
These
are
the
generations
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
when
they
were
created,
in
the
day
that
the
LORD
God
made
the
earth
and
the
heavens,
002:005
And
every
plant
of
the
field
before
it
was
in
the
earth,
and
every
herb
of
the
field
before
it
grew:
for
the
LORD
God
had
not
caused
it
to
rain
upon
the
earth,
and
there
was
not
a
man
to
till
the
ground.
002:006
But
there
went
up
a
mist
from
the
earth,
and
watered
the
whole
face
of
the
ground.
002:007
And
the
LORD
God
formed
man
of
the
dust
of
the
ground,
and
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life;
and
man
became
a
living
soul.
002:008
And
the
LORD
God
planted
a
garden
eastward
in
Eden;
and
there
he
put
the
man
whom
he
had
formed.
002:009
And
out
of
the
ground
made
the
LORD
God
to
grow
every
tree
that
is
pleasant
to
the
sight,
and
good
for
food;
the
tree
of
life
also
in
the
midst
of
the
garden,
and
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil.
002:010
And
a
river
went
out
of
Eden
to
water
the
garden;
and
from
thence
it
was
parted,
and
became
into
four
heads.
002:011
The
name
of
the
first
is
Pison:
that
is
it
which
compasseth
the
whole
land
of
Havilah,
where
there
is
gold;
002:012
And
the
gold
of
that
land
is
good:
there
is
bdellium
and
the
onyx
stone.
002:013
And
the
name
of
the
second
river
is
Gihon:
the
same
is
it
that
compasseth
the
whole
land
of
Ethiopia.
002:014
And
the
name
of
the
third
river
is
Hiddekel:
that
is
it
which
goeth
toward
the
east
of
Assyria.
And
the
fourth
river
is
Euphrates.
002:015
And
the
LORD
God
took
the
man,
and
put
him
into
the
garden
of
Eden
to
dress
it
and
to
keep
it.
002:016
And
the
LORD
God
commanded
the
man,
saying,
Of
every
tree
of
the
garden
thou
mayest
freely
eat:
002:017
But
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil,
thou
shalt
not
eat
of
it:
for
in
the
day
that
thou
eatest
thereof
thou
shalt
surely
die.
002:018
And
the
LORD
God
said,
It
is
not
good
that
the
man
should
be
alone;
I
will
make
him
an
help
meet
for
him.
002:019
And
out
of
the
ground
the
LORD
God
formed
every
beast
of
the
field,
and
every
fowl
of
the
air;
and
brought
them
unto
Adam
to
see
what
he
would
call
them:
and
whatsoever
Adam
called
every
living
creature,
that
was
the
name
thereof.
002:020
And
Adam
gave
names
to
all
cattle,
and
to
the
fowl
of
the
air,
and
to
every
beast
of
the
field;
but
for
Adam
there
was
not
found
an
help
meet
for
him.
002:021
And
the
LORD
God
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
fall
upon
Adam,
and
he
slept:
and
he
took
one
of
his
ribs,
and
closed
up
the
flesh
instead
thereof;
002:022
And
the
rib,
which
the
LORD
God
had
taken
from
man,
made
he
a
woman,
and
brought
her
unto
the
man.
002:023
And
Adam
said,
This
is
now
bone
of
my
bones,
and
flesh
of
my
flesh:
she
shall
be
called
Woman,
because
she
was
taken
out
of
Man.
002:024
Therefore
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
his
mother,
and
shall
cleave
unto
his
wife:
and
they
shall
be
one
flesh.
002:025
And
they
were
both
naked,
the
man
and
his
wife,
and
were
not
ashamed.
003:001
Now
the
serpent
was
more
subtil
than
any
beast
of
the
field
which
the
LORD
God
had
made.
And
he
said
unto
the
woman,
Yea,
hath
God
said,
Ye
shall
not
eat
of
every
tree
of
the
garden?
003:002
And
the
woman
said
unto
the
serpent,
We
may
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
of
the
garden:
003:003
But
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
garden,
God
hath
said,
Ye
shall
not
eat
of
it,
neither
shall
ye
touch
it,
lest
ye
die.
003:004
And
the
serpent
said
unto
the
woman,
Ye
shall
not
surely
die:
003:005
For
God
doth
know
that
in
the
day
ye
eat
thereof,
then
your
eyes
shall
be
opened,
and
ye
shall
be
as
gods,
knowing
good
and
evil.
003:006
And
when
the
woman
saw
that
the
tree
was
good
for
food,
and
that
it
was
pleasant
to
the
eyes,
and
a
tree
to
be
desired
to
make
one
wise,
she
took
of
the
fruit
thereof,
and
did
eat,
and
gave
also
unto
her
husband
with
her;
and
he
did
eat.
003:007
And
the
eyes
of
them
both
were
opened,
and
they
knew
that
they
were
naked;
and
they
sewed
fig
leaves
together,
and
made
themselves
aprons.
003:008
And
they
heard
the
voice
of
the
LORD
God
walking
in
the
garden
in
the
cool
of
the
day:
and
Adam
and
his
wife
hid
themselves
from
the
presence
of
the
LORD
God
amongst
the
trees
of
the
garden.
003:009
And
the
LORD
God
called
unto
Adam,
and
said
unto
him,
Where
art
thou?
003:010
And
he
said,
I
heard
thy
voice
in
the
garden,
and
I
was
afraid,
because
I
was
naked;
and
I
hid
myself.
003:011
And
he
said,
Who
told
thee
that
thou
wast
naked?
Hast
thou
eaten
of
the
tree,
whereof
I
commanded
thee
that
thou
shouldest
not
eat?
003:012
And
the
man
said,
The
woman
whom
thou
gavest
to
be
with
me,
she
gave
me
of
the
tree,
and
I
did
eat.
003:013
And
the
LORD
God
said
unto
the
woman,
What
is
this
that
thou
hast
done?
And
the
woman
said,
The
serpent
beguiled
me,
and
I
did
eat.
003:014
And
the
LORD
God
said
unto
the
serpent,
Because
thou
hast
done
this,
thou
art
cursed
above
all
cattle,
and
above
every
beast
of
the
field;
upon
thy
belly
shalt
thou
go,
and
dust
shalt
thou
eat
all
the
days
of
thy
life:
003:015
And
I
will
put
enmity
between
thee
and
the
woman,
and
between
thy
seed
and
her
seed;
it
shall
bruise
thy
head,
and
thou
shalt
bruise
his
heel.
003:016
Unto
the
woman
he
said,
I
will
greatly
multiply
thy
sorrow
and
thy
conception;
in
sorrow
thou
shalt
bring
forth
children;
and
thy
desire
shall
be
to
thy
husband,
and
he
shall
rule
over
thee.
003:017
And
unto
Adam
he
said,
Because
thou
hast
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
thy
wife,
and
hast
eaten
of
the
tree,
of
which
I
commanded
thee,
saying,
Thou
shalt
not
eat
of
it:
cursed
is
the
ground
for
thy
sake;
in
sorrow
shalt
thou
eat
of
it
all
the
days
of
thy
life;
003:018
Thorns
also
and
thistles
shall
it
bring
forth
to
thee;
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
herb
of
the
field;
003:019
In
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread,
till
thou
return
unto
the
ground;
for
out
of
it
wast
thou
taken:
for
dust
thou
art,
and
unto
dust
shalt
thou
return.
003:020
And
Adam
called
his
wife's
name
Eve;
because
she
was
the
mother
of
all
living.
003:021
Unto
Adam
also
and
to
his
wife
did
the
LORD
God
make
coats
of
skins,
and
clothed
them.
003:022
And
the
LORD
God
said,
Behold,
the
man
is
become
as
one
of
us,
to
know
good
and
evil:
and
now,
lest
he
put
forth
his
hand,
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life,
and
eat,
and
live
for
ever:
003:023
Therefore
the
LORD
God
sent
him
forth
from
the
garden
of
Eden,
to
till
the
ground
from
whence
he
was
taken.
003:024
So
he
drove
out
the
man;
and
he
placed
at
the
east
of
the
garden
of
Eden
Cherubims,
and
a
flaming
sword
which
turned
every
way,
to
keep
the
way
of
the
tree
of
life.
004:001
And
Adam
knew
Eve
his
wife;
and
she
conceived,
and
bare
Cain,
and
said,
I
have
gotten
a
man
from
the
LORD.
004:002
And
she
again
bare
his
brother
Abel.
And
Abel
was
a
keeper
of
sheep,
but
Cain
was
a
tiller
of
the
ground.
004:003
And
in
process
of
time
it
came
to
pass,
that
Cain
brought
of
the
fruit
of
the
ground
an
offering
unto
the
LORD.
004:004
And
Abel,
he
also
brought
of
the
firstlings
of
his
flock
and
of
the
fat
thereof.
And
the
LORD
had
respect
unto
Abel
and
to
his
offering:
004:005
But
unto
Cain
and
to
his
offering
he
had
not
respect.
And
Cain
was
very
wroth,
and
his
countenance
fell.
004:006
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Cain,
Why
art
thou
wroth?
and
why
is
thy
countenance
fallen?
004:007
If
thou
doest
well,
shalt
thou
not
be
accepted?
and
if
thou
doest
not
well,
sin
lieth
at
the
door.
And
unto
thee
shall
be
his
desire,
and
thou
shalt
rule
over
him.
004:008
And
Cain
talked
with
Abel
his
brother:
and
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
were
in
the
field,
that
Cain
rose
up
against
Abel
his
brother,
and
slew
him.
004:009
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Cain,
Where
is
Abel
thy
brother?
And
he
said,
I
know
not:
Am
I
my
brother's
keeper?
004:010
And
he
said,
What
hast
thou
done?
the
voice
of
thy
brother's
blood
crieth
unto
me
from
the
ground.
004:011
And
now
art
thou
cursed
from
the
earth,
which
hath
opened
her
mouth
to
receive
thy
brother's
blood
from
thy
hand;
004:012
When
thou
tillest
the
ground,
it
shall
not
henceforth
yield
unto
thee
her
strength;
a
fugitive
and
a
vagabond
shalt
thou
be
in
the
earth.
004:013
And
Cain
said
unto
the
LORD,
My
punishment
is
greater
than
I
can
bear.
004:014
Behold,
thou
hast
driven
me
out
this
day
from
the
face
of
the
earth;
and
from
thy
face
shall
I
be
hid;
and
I
shall
be
a
fugitive
and
a
vagabond
in
the
earth;
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
every
one
that
findeth
me
shall
slay
me.
004:015
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Therefore
whosoever
slayeth
Cain,
vengeance
shall
be
taken
on
him
sevenfold.
And
the
LORD
set
a
mark
upon
Cain,
lest
any
finding
him
should
kill
him.
004:016
And
Cain
went
out
from
the
presence
of
the
LORD,
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
Nod,
on
the
east
of
Eden.
004:017
And
Cain
knew
his
wife;
and
she
conceived,
and
bare
Enoch:
and
he
builded
a
city,
and
called
the
name
of
the
city,
after
the
name
of
his
son,
Enoch.
004:018
And
unto
Enoch
was
born
Irad:
and
Irad
begat
Mehujael:
and
Mehujael
begat
Methusael:
and
Methusael
begat
Lamech.
004:019
And
Lamech
took
unto
him
two
wives:
the
name
of
the
one
was
Adah,
and
the
name
of
the
other
Zillah.
004:020
And
Adah
bare
Jabal:
he
was
the
father
of
such
as
dwell
in
tents,
and
of
such
as
have
cattle.
004:021
And
his
brother's
name
was
Jubal:
he
was
the
father
of
all
such
as
handle
the
harp
and
organ.
004:022
And
Zillah,
she
also
bare
Tubalcain,
an
instructer
of
every
artificer
in
brass
and
iron:
and
the
sister
of
Tubalcain
was
Naamah.
004:023
And
Lamech
said
unto
his
wives,
Adah
and
Zillah,
Hear
my
voice;
ye
wives
of
Lamech,
hearken
unto
my
speech:
for
I
have
slain
a
man
to
my
wounding,
and
a
young
man
to
my
hurt.
004:024
If
Cain
shall
be
avenged
sevenfold,
truly
Lamech
seventy
and
sevenfold.
004:025
And
Adam
knew
his
wife
again;
and
she
bare
a
son,
and
called
his
name
Seth:
For
God,
said
she,
hath
appointed
me
another
seed
instead
of
Abel,
whom
Cain
slew.
004:026
And
to
Seth,
to
him
also
there
was
born
a
son;
and
he
called
his
name
Enos:
then
began
men
to
call
upon
the
name
of
the
LORD.
005:001
This
is
the
book
of
the
generations
of
Adam.
In
the
day
that
God
created
man,
in
the
likeness
of
God
made
he
him;
005:002
Male
and
female
created
he
them;
and
blessed
them,
and
called
their
name
Adam,
in
the
day
when
they
were
created.
005:003
And
Adam
lived
an
hundred
and
thirty
years,
and
begat
a
son
in
his
own
likeness,
and
after
his
image;
and

005:004
And

005:012
And

And

And

005:015
And

005:016
And

years:
and

005:018
And

005:019
And

eight
hundred
years,
and
begat

and

005:020
And

and
two
years:
and

005:021
And

and

years,
and

005:022
And

with
God
after

hundred
years,
and

and
daughters:
005:023
And
all
the
days
of
Enoch
were
three
hundred
sixty
and
five
years:
005:024
And
Enoch
walked
with
God:
and
he
was
not;
for
God
took
him.
005:025
And

And

and

And

years:
and

005:028
And
Lamech
lived
an
hundred
eighty
and
two
years,
and
begat
a
son:
005:029
And
he
called
his
name
Noah,
saying,
This
same
shall
comfort
us
concerning
our
work
and
toil
of
our
hands,
because
of
the
ground
which
the
LORD
hath
cursed.
005:030
And
Lamech
lived
after
he
begat
Noah
five
hundred
ninety
and
five
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters:
005:031
And
all
the
days
of
Lamech
were
seven
hundred
seventy
and
seven
years:
and
he
died.
005:032
And
Noah
was
five
hundred
years
old:
and
Noah
begat
Shem,
Ham,
and
Japheth.
006:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
men
began
to
multiply
on
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
daughters
were
born
unto
them,
006:002
That
the
sons
of
God
saw
the
daughters
of
men
that
they
were
fair;
and
they
took
them
wives
of
all
which
they
chose.
006:003
And
the
LORD
said,
My
spirit
shall
not
always
strive
with
man,
for
that
he
also
is
flesh:
yet
his
days
shall
be
an
hundred
and
twenty
years.
006:004
There
were
giants
in
the
earth
in
those
days;
and
also
after
that,
when
the
sons
of
God
came
in
unto
the
daughters
of
men,
and
they
bare
children
to
them,
the
same
became
mighty
men
which
were
of
old,
men
of
renown.
006:005
And
God
saw
that
the
wickedness
of
man
was
great
in
the
earth,
and
that
every
imagination
of
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
was
only
evil
continually.
006:006
And
it
repented
the
LORD
that
he
had
made
man
on
the
earth,
and
it
grieved
him
at
his
heart.
006:007
And
the
LORD
said,
I
will
destroy
man
whom
I
have
created
from
the
face
of
the
earth;
both
man,
and
beast,
and
the
creeping
thing,
and
the
fowls
of
the
air;
for
it
repenteth
me
that
I
have
made
them.
006:008
But
Noah
found
grace
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD.
006:009
These
are
the
generations
of
Noah:
Noah
was
a
just
man
and
perfect
in
his
generations,
and
Noah
walked
with
God.
006:010
And
Noah
begat
three
sons,
Shem,
Ham,
and
Japheth.
006:011
The
earth
also
was
corrupt
before
God,
and
the
earth
was
filled
with
violence.
006:012
And
God
looked
upon
the
earth,
and,
behold,
it
was
corrupt;
for
all
flesh
had
corrupted
his
way
upon
the
earth.
006:013
And
God
said
unto
Noah,
The
end
of
all
flesh
is
come
before
me;
for
the
earth
is
filled
with
violence
through
them;
and,
behold,
I
will
destroy
them
with
the
earth.
006:014
Make
thee
an
ark
of
gopher
wood;
rooms
shalt
thou
make
in
the
ark,
and
shalt
pitch
it
within
and
without
with
pitch.
006:015
And
this
is
the
fashion
which
thou
shalt
make
it
of:
The
length
of
the
ark
shall
be
three
hundred
cubits,
the
breadth
of
it
fifty
cubits,
and
the
height
of
it
thirty
cubits.
006:016
A
window
shalt
thou
make
to
the
ark,
and
in
a
cubit
shalt
thou
finish
it
above;
and
the
door
of
the
ark
shalt
thou
set
in
the
side
thereof;
with
lower,
second,
and
third
stories
shalt
thou
make
it.
006:017
And,
behold,
I,
even
I,
do
bring
a
flood
of
waters
upon
the
earth,
to
destroy
all
flesh,
wherein
is
the
breath
of
life,
from
under
heaven;
and
every
thing
that
is
in
the
earth
shall
die.
006:018
But
with
thee
will
I
establish
my
covenant;
and
thou
shalt
come
into
the
ark,
thou,
and
thy
sons,
and
thy
wife,
and
thy
sons'
wives
with
thee.
006:019
