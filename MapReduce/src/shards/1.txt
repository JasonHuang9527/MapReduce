And
of
every
living
thing
of
all
flesh,
two
of
every
sort
shalt
thou
bring
into
the
ark,
to
keep
them
alive
with
thee;
they
shall
be
male
and
female.
006:020
Of
fowls
after
their
kind,
and
of
cattle
after
their
kind,
of
every
creeping
thing
of
the
earth
after
his
kind,
two
of
every
sort
shall
come
unto
thee,
to
keep
them
alive.
006:021
And
take
thou
unto
thee
of
all
food
that
is
eaten,
and
thou
shalt
gather
it
to
thee;
and
it
shall
be
for
food
for
thee,
and
for
them.
006:022
Thus
did
Noah;
according
to
all
that
God
commanded
him,
so
did
he.
007:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Noah,
Come
thou
and
all
thy
house
into
the
ark;
for
thee
have
I
seen
righteous
before
me
in
this
generation.
007:002
Of
every
clean
beast
thou
shalt
take
to
thee
by
sevens,
the
male
and
his
female:
and
of
beasts
that
are
not
clean
by
two,
the
male
and
his
female.
007:003
Of
fowls
also
of
the
air
by
sevens,
the
male
and
the
female;
to
keep
seed
alive
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth.
007:004
For
yet
seven
days,
and
I
will
cause
it
to
rain
upon
the
earth
forty
days
and
forty
nights;
and
every
living
substance
that
I
have
made
will
I
destroy
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth.
007:005
And
Noah
did
according
unto
all
that
the
LORD
commanded
him.
007:006
And
Noah
was
six
hundred
years
old
when
the
flood
of
waters
was
upon
the
earth.
007:007
And
Noah
went
in,
and
his
sons,
and
his
wife,
and
his
sons'
wives
with
him,
into
the
ark,
because
of
the
waters
of
the
flood.
007:008
Of
clean
beasts,
and
of
beasts
that
are
not
clean,
and
of
fowls,
and
of
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth,
007:009
There
went
in
two
and
two
unto
Noah
into
the
ark,
the
male
and
the
female,
as
God
had
commanded
Noah.
007:010
And
it
came
to
pass
after
seven
days,
that
the
waters
of
the
flood
were
upon
the
earth.
007:011
In
the
six
hundredth
year
of
Noah's
life,
in
the
second
month,
the
seventeenth
day
of
the
month,
the
same
day
were
all
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
broken
up,
and
the
windows
of
heaven
were
opened.
007:012
And
the
rain
was
upon
the
earth
forty
days
and
forty
nights.
007:013
In
the
selfsame
day
entered
Noah,
and
Shem,
and
Ham,
and
Japheth,
the
sons
of
Noah,
and
Noah's
wife,
and
the
three
wives
of
his
sons
with
them,
into
the
ark;
007:014
They,
and
every
beast
after
his
kind,
and
all
the
cattle
after
their
kind,
and
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
after
his
kind,
and
every
fowl
after
his
kind,
every
bird
of
every
sort.
007:015
And
they
went
in
unto
Noah
into
the
ark,
two
and
two
of
all
flesh,
wherein
is
the
breath
of
life.
007:016
And
they
that
went
in,
went
in
male
and
female
of
all
flesh,
as
God
had
commanded
him:
and
the
LORD
shut
him
in.
007:017
And
the
flood
was
forty
days
upon
the
earth;
and
the
waters
increased,
and
bare
up
the
ark,
and
it
was
lift
up
above
the
earth.
007:018
And
the
waters
prevailed,
and
were
increased
greatly
upon
the
earth;
and
the
ark
went
upon
the
face
of
the
waters.
007:019
And
the
waters
prevailed
exceedingly
upon
the
earth;
and
all
the
high
hills,
that
were
under
the
whole
heaven,
were
covered.
007:020
Fifteen
cubits
upward
did
the
waters
prevail;
and
the
mountains
were
covered.
007:021
And
all
flesh
died
that
moved
upon
the
earth,
both
of
fowl,
and
of
cattle,
and
of
beast,
and
of
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth,
and
every
man:
007:022
All
in
whose
nostrils
was
the
breath
of
life,
of
all
that
was
in
the
dry
land,
died.
007:023
And
every
living
substance
was
destroyed
which
was
upon
the
face
of
the
ground,
both
man,
and
cattle,
and
the
creeping
things,
and
the
fowl
of
the
heaven;
and
they
were
destroyed
from
the
earth:
and
Noah
only
remained
alive,
and
they
that
were
with
him
in
the
ark.
007:024
And
the
waters
prevailed
upon
the
earth
an
hundred
and
fifty
days.
008:001
And
God
remembered
Noah,
and
every
living
thing,
and
all
the
cattle
that
was
with
him
in
the
ark:
and
God
made
a
wind
to
pass
over
the
earth,
and
the
waters
asswaged;
008:002
The
fountains
also
of
the
deep
and
the
windows
of
heaven
were
stopped,
and
the
rain
from
heaven
was
restrained;
008:003
And
the
waters
returned
from
off
the
earth
continually:
and
after
the
end
of
the
hundred
and
fifty
days
the
waters
were
abated.
008:004
And
the
ark
rested
in
the
seventh
month,
on
the
seventeenth
day
of
the
month,
upon
the
mountains
of
Ararat.
008:005
And
the
waters
decreased
continually
until
the
tenth
month:
in
the
tenth
month,
on
the
first
day
of
the
month,
were
the
tops
of
the
mountains
seen.
008:006
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
forty
days,
that
Noah
opened
the
window
of
the
ark
which
he
had
made:
008:007
And
he
sent
forth
a
raven,
which
went
forth
to
and
fro,
until
the
waters
were
dried
up
from
off
the
earth.
008:008
Also
he
sent
forth
a
dove
from
him,
to
see
if
the
waters
were
abated
from
off
the
face
of
the
ground;
008:009
But
the
dove
found
no
rest
for
the
sole
of
her
foot,
and
she
returned
unto
him
into
the
ark,
for
the
waters
were
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth:
then
he
put
forth
his
hand,
and
took
her,
and
pulled
her
in
unto
him
into
the
ark.
008:010
And
he
stayed
yet
other
seven
days;
and
again
he
sent
forth
the
dove
out
of
the
ark;
008:011
And
the
dove
came
in
to
him
in
the
evening;
and,
lo,
in
her
mouth
was
an
olive
leaf
pluckt
off:
so
Noah
knew
that
the
waters
were
abated
from
off
the
earth.
008:012
And
he
stayed
yet
other
seven
days;
and
sent
forth
the
dove;
which
returned
not
again
unto
him
any
more.
008:013
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
six
hundredth
and
first
year,
in
the
first
month,
the
first
day
of
the
month,
the
waters
were
dried
up
from
off
the
earth:
and
Noah
removed
the
covering
of
the
ark,
and
looked,
and,
behold,
the
face
of
the
ground
was
dry.
008:014
And
in
the
second
month,
on
the
seven
and
twentieth
day
of
the
month,
was
the
earth
dried.
008:015
And
God
spake
unto
Noah,
saying,
008:016
Go
forth
of
the
ark,
thou,
and
thy
wife,
and
thy
sons,
and
thy
sons'
wives
with
thee.
008:017
Bring
forth
with
thee
every
living
thing
that
is
with
thee,
of
all
flesh,
both
of
fowl,
and
of
cattle,
and
of
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth;
that
they
may
breed
abundantly
in
the
earth,
and
be
fruitful,
and
multiply
upon
the
earth.
008:018
And
Noah
went
forth,
and
his
sons,
and
his
wife,
and
his
sons'
wives
with
him:
008:019
Every
beast,
every
creeping
thing,
and
every
fowl,
and
whatsoever
creepeth
upon
the
earth,
after
their
kinds,
went
forth
out
of
the
ark.
008:020
And
Noah
builded
an
altar
unto
the
LORD;
and
took
of
every
clean
beast,
and
of
every
clean
fowl,
and
offered
burnt
offerings
on
the
altar.
008:021
And
the
LORD
smelled
a
sweet
savour;
and
the
LORD
said
in
his
heart,
I
will
not
again
curse
the
ground
any
more
for
man's
sake;
for
the
imagination
of
man's
heart
is
evil
from
his
youth;
neither
will
I
again
smite
any
more
every
thing
living,
as
I
have
done.
008:022
While
the
earth
remaineth,
seedtime
and
harvest,
and
cold
and
heat,
and
summer
and
winter,
and
day
and
night
shall
not
cease.
009:001
And
God
blessed
Noah
and
his
sons,
and
said
unto
them,
Be
fruitful,
and
multiply,
and
replenish
the
earth.
009:002
And
the
fear
of
you
and
the
dread
of
you
shall
be
upon
every
beast
of
the
earth,
and
upon
every
fowl
of
the
air,
upon
all
that
moveth
upon
the
earth,
and
upon
all
the
fishes
of
the
sea;
into
your
hand
are
they
delivered.
009:003
Every
moving
thing
that
liveth
shall
be
meat
for
you;
even
as
the
green
herb
have
I
given
you
all
things.
009:004
But
flesh
with
the
life
thereof,
which
is
the
blood
thereof,
shall
ye
not
eat.
009:005
And
surely
your
blood
of
your
lives
will
I
require;
at
the
hand
of
every
beast
will
I
require
it,
and
at
the
hand
of
man;
at
the
hand
of
every
man's
brother
will
I
require
the
life
of
man.
009:006
Whoso
sheddeth
man's
blood,
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed:
for
in
the
image
of
God
made
he
man.
009:007
And
you,
be
ye
fruitful,
and
multiply;
bring
forth
abundantly
in
the
earth,
and
multiply
therein.
009:008
And
God
spake
unto
Noah,
and
to
his
sons
with
him,
saying,
009:009
And
I,
behold,
I
establish
my
covenant
with
you,
and
with
your
seed
after
you;
009:010
And
with
every
living
creature
that
is
with
you,
of
the
fowl,
of
the
cattle,
and
of
every
beast
of
the
earth
with
you;
from
all
that
go
out
of
the
ark,
to
every
beast
of
the
earth.
009:011
And
I
will
establish
my
covenant
with
you,
neither
shall
all
flesh
be
cut
off
any
more
by
the
waters
of
a
flood;
neither
shall
there
any
more
be
a
flood
to
destroy
the
earth.
009:012
And
God
said,
This
is
the
token
of
the
covenant
which
I
make
between
me
and
you
and
every
living
creature
that
is
with
you,
for
perpetual
generations:
009:013
I
do
set
my
bow
in
the
cloud,
and
it
shall
be
for
a
token
of
a
covenant
between
me
and
the
earth.
009:014
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
I
bring
a
cloud
over
the
earth,
that
the
bow
shall
be
seen
in
the
cloud:
009:015
And
I
will
remember
my
covenant,
which
is
between
me
and
you
and
every
living
creature
of
all
flesh;
and
the
waters
shall
no
more
become
a
flood
to
destroy
all
flesh.
009:016
And
the
bow
shall
be
in
the
cloud;
and
I
will
look
upon
it,
that
I
may
remember
the
everlasting
covenant
between
God
and
every
living
creature
of
all
flesh
that
is
upon
the
earth.
009:017
And
God
said
unto
Noah,
This
is
the
token
of
the
covenant,
which
I
have
established
between
me
and
all
flesh
that
is
upon
the
earth.
009:018
And
the
sons
of
Noah,
that
went
forth
of
the
ark,
were
Shem,
and
Ham,
and
Japheth:
and
Ham
is
the
father
of
Canaan.
009:019
These
are
the
three
sons
of
Noah:
and
of
them
was
the
whole
earth
overspread.
009:020
And
Noah
began
to
be
an
husbandman,
and
he
planted
a
vineyard:
009:021
And
he
drank
of
the
wine,
and
was
drunken;
and
he
was
uncovered
within
his
tent.
009:022
And
Ham,
the
father
of
Canaan,
saw
the
nakedness
of
his
father,
and
told
his
two
brethren
without.
009:023
And
Shem
and
Japheth
took
a
garment,
and
laid
it
upon
both
their
shoulders,
and
went
backward,
and
covered
the
nakedness
of
their
father;
and
their
faces
were
backward,
and
they
saw
not
their
father's
nakedness.
009:024
And
Noah
awoke
from
his
wine,
and
knew
what
his
younger
son
had
done
unto
him.
009:025
And
he
said,
Cursed
be
Canaan;
a
servant
of
servants
shall
he
be
unto
his
brethren.
009:026
And
he
said,
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Shem;
and
Canaan
shall
be
his
servant.
009:027
God
shall
enlarge
Japheth,
and
he
shall
dwell
in
the
tents
of
Shem;
and
Canaan
shall
be
his
servant.
009:028
And
Noah
lived
after
the
flood
three
hundred
and
fifty
years.
009:029
And
all
the
days
of
Noah
were
nine
hundred
and
fifty
years:
and
he
died.
010:001
Now
these
are
the
generations
of
the
sons
of
Noah,
Shem,
Ham,
and
Japheth:
and
unto
them
were
sons
born
after
the
flood.
010:002
The
sons
of
Japheth;
Gomer,
and
Magog,
and
Madai,
and
Javan,
and
Tubal,
and
Meshech,
and
Tiras.
010:003
And
the
sons
of
Gomer;
Ashkenaz,
and
Riphath,
and
Togarmah.
010:004
And
the
sons
of
Javan;
Elishah,
and
Tarshish,
Kittim,
and
Dodanim.
010:005
By
these
were
the
isles
of
the
Gentiles
divided
in
their
lands;
every
one
after
his
tongue,
after
their
families,
in
their
nations.
010:006
And
the
sons
of
Ham;
Cush,
and
Mizraim,
and
Phut,
and
Canaan.
010:007
And
the
sons
of
Cush;
Seba,
and
Havilah,
and
Sabtah,
and
Raamah,
and
Sabtechah:
and
the
sons
of
Raamah;
Sheba,
and
Dedan.
010:008
And
Cush
begat
Nimrod:
he
began
to
be
a
mighty
one
in
the
earth.
010:009
He
was
a
mighty
hunter
before
the
LORD:
wherefore
it
is
said,
Even
as
Nimrod
the
mighty
hunter
before
the
LORD.
010:010
And
the
beginning
of
his
kingdom
was
Babel,
and
Erech,
and
Accad,
and
Calneh,
in
the
land
of
Shinar.
010:011
Out
of
that
land
went
forth
Asshur,
and
builded
Nineveh,
and
the
city
Rehoboth,
and
Calah,
010:012
And
Resen
between
Nineveh
and
Calah:
the
same
is
a
great
city.
010:013
And
Mizraim
begat
Ludim,
and
Anamim,
and
Lehabim,
and
Naphtuhim,
010:014
And
Pathrusim,
and
Casluhim,
(out
of
whom
came
Philistim,)
and
Caphtorim.
010:015
And
Canaan
begat
Sidon
his
first
born,
and
Heth,
010:016
And
the
Jebusite,
and
the
Amorite,
and
the
Girgasite,
010:017
And
the
Hivite,
and
the
Arkite,
and
the
Sinite,
010:018
And
the
Arvadite,
and
the
Zemarite,
and
the
Hamathite:
and
afterward
were
the
families
of
the
Canaanites
spread
abroad.
010:019
And
the
border
of
the
Canaanites
was
from
Sidon,
as
thou
comest
to
Gerar,
unto
Gaza;
as
thou
goest,
unto
Sodom,
and
Gomorrah,
and
Admah,
and
Zeboim,
even
unto
Lasha.
010:020
These
are
the
sons
of
Ham,
after
their
families,
after
their
tongues,
in
their
countries,
and
in
their
nations.
010:021
Unto
Shem
also,
the
father
of
all
the
children
of
Eber,
the
brother
of
Japheth
the
elder,
even
to
him
were
children
born.
010:022
The
children
of
Shem;
Elam,
and
Asshur,
and
Arphaxad,
and
Lud,
and
Aram.
010:023
And
the
children
of
Aram;
Uz,
and
Hul,
and
Gether,
and
Mash.
010:024
And
Arphaxad
begat
Salah;
and
Salah
begat
Eber.
010:025
And
unto
Eber
were
born
two
sons:
the
name
of
one
was
Peleg;
for
in
his
days
was
the
earth
divided;
and
his
brother's
name
was
Joktan.
010:026
And
Joktan
begat
Almodad,
and
Sheleph,
and
Hazarmaveth,
and
Jerah,
010:027
And
Hadoram,
and
Uzal,
and
Diklah,
010:028
And
Obal,
and
Abimael,
and
Sheba,
010:029
And
Ophir,
and
Havilah,
and
Jobab:
all
these
were
the
sons
of
Joktan.
010:030
And
their
dwelling
was
from
Mesha,
as
thou
goest
unto
Sephar
a
mount
of
the
east.
010:031
These
are
the
sons
of
Shem,
after
their
families,
after
their
tongues,
in
their
lands,
after
their
nations.
010:032
These
are
the
families
of
the
sons
of
Noah,
after
their
generations,
in
their
nations:
and
by
these
were
the
nations
divided
in
the
earth
after
the
flood.
011:001
And
the
whole
earth
was
of
one
language,
and
of
one
speech.
011:002
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
journeyed
from
the
east,
that
they
found
a
plain
in
the
land
of
Shinar;
and
they
dwelt
there.
011:003
And
they
said
one
to
another,
Go
to,
let
us
make
brick,
and
burn
them
thoroughly.
And
they
had
brick
for
stone,
and
slime
had
they
for
morter.
011:004
And
they
said,
Go
to,
let
us
build
us
a
city
and
a
tower,
whose
top
may
reach
unto
heaven;
and
let
us
make
us
a
name,
lest
we
be
scattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth.
011:005
And
the
LORD
came
down
to
see
the
city
and
the
tower,
which
the
children
of
men
builded.
011:006
And
the
LORD
said,
Behold,
the
people
is
one,
and
they
have
all
one
language;
and
this
they
begin
to
do:
and
now
nothing
will
be
restrained
from
them,
which
they
have
imagined
to
do.
011:007
Go
to,
let
us
go
down,
and
there
confound
their
language,
that
they
may
not
understand
one
another's
speech.
011:008
So
the
LORD
scattered
them
abroad
from
thence
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth:
and
they
left
off
to
build
the
city.
011:009
Therefore
is
the
name
of
it
called
Babel;
because
the
LORD
did
there
confound
the
language
of
all
the
earth:
and
from
thence
did
the
LORD
scatter
them
abroad
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth.
011:010
These
are
the
generations
of
Shem:
Shem
was
an
hundred
years
old,
and
begat
Arphaxad
two
years
after
the
flood:
011:011
And
Shem
lived
after
he
begat
Arphaxad
five
hundred
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters.
011:012
And
Arphaxad
lived
five
and
thirty
years,
and
begat
Salah:
011:013
And
Arphaxad
lived
after
he
begat
Salah
four
hundred
and
three
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters.
011:014
And
Salah
lived
thirty
years,
and
begat
Eber:
011:015
And
Salah
lived
after
he
begat
Eber
four
hundred
and
three
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters.
011:016
And
Eber
lived
four
and
thirty
years,
and
begat
Peleg:
011:017
And
Eber
lived
after
he
begat
Peleg
four
hundred
and
thirty
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters.
011:018
And
Peleg
lived
thirty
years,
and
begat
Reu:
011:019
And
Peleg
lived
after
he
begat
Reu
two
hundred
and
nine
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters.
011:020
And
Reu
lived
two
and
thirty
years,
and
begat
Serug:
011:021
And
Reu
lived
after
he
begat
Serug
two
hundred
and
seven
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters.
011:022
And
Serug
lived
thirty
years,
and
begat
Nahor:
011:023
And
Serug
lived
after
he
begat
Nahor
two
hundred
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters.
011:024
And
Nahor
lived
nine
and
twenty
years,
and
begat
Terah:
011:025
And
Nahor
lived
after
he
begat
Terah
an
hundred
and
nineteen
years,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters.
011:026
And
Terah
lived
seventy
years,
and
begat
Abram,
Nahor,
and
Haran.
011:027
Now
these
are
the
generations
of
Terah:
Terah
begat
Abram,
Nahor,
and
Haran;
and
Haran
begat
Lot.
011:028
And
Haran
died
before
his
father
Terah
in
the
land
of
his
nativity,
in
Ur
of
the
Chaldees.
011:029
And
Abram
and
Nahor
took
them
wives:
the
name
of
Abram's
wife
was
Sarai;
and
the
name
of
Nahor's
wife,
Milcah,
the
daughter
of
Haran,
the
father
of
Milcah,
and
the
father
of
Iscah.
011:030
But
Sarai
was
barren;
she
had
no
child.
011:031
And
Terah
took
Abram
his
son,
and
Lot
the
son
of
Haran
his
son's
son,
and
Sarai
his
daughter
in
law,
his
son
Abram's
wife;
and
they
went
forth
with
them
from
Ur
of
the
Chaldees,
to
go
into
the
land
of
Canaan;
and
they
came
unto
Haran,
and
dwelt
there.
011:032
And
the
days
of
Terah
were
two
hundred
and
five
years:
and
Terah
died
in
Haran.
012:001
Now
the
LORD
had
said
unto
Abram,
Get
thee
out
of
thy
country,
and
from
thy
kindred,
and
from
thy
father's
house,
unto
a
land
that
I
will
shew
thee:
012:002
And
I
will
make
of
thee
a
great
nation,
and
I
will
bless
thee,
and
make
thy
name
great;
and
thou
shalt
be
a
blessing:
012:003
And
I
will
bless
them
that
bless
thee,
and
curse
him
that
curseth
thee:
and
in
thee
shall
all
families
of
the
earth
be
blessed.
012:004
So
Abram
departed,
as
the
LORD
had
spoken
unto
him;
and
Lot
went
with
him:
and
Abram
was
seventy
and
five
years
old
when
he
departed
out
of
Haran.
012:005
And
Abram
took
Sarai
his
wife,
and
Lot
his
brother's
son,
and
all
their
substance
that
they
had
gathered,
and
the
souls
that
they
had
gotten
in
Haran;
and
they
went
forth
to
go
into
the
land
of
Canaan;
and
into
the
land
of
Canaan
they
came.
012:006
And
Abram
passed
through
the
land
unto
the
place
of
Sichem,
unto
the
plain
of
Moreh.
And
the
Canaanite
was
then
in
the
land.
012:007
And
the
LORD
appeared
unto
Abram,
and
said,
Unto
thy
seed
will
I
give
this
land:
and
there
builded
he
an
altar
unto
the
LORD,
who
appeared
unto
him.
012:008
And
he
removed
from
thence
unto
a
mountain
on
the
east
of
Bethel,
and
pitched
his
tent,
having
Bethel
on
the
west,
and
Hai
on
the
east:
and
there
he
builded
an
altar
unto
the
LORD,
and
called
upon
the
name
of
the
LORD.
012:009
And
Abram
journeyed,
going
on
still
toward
the
south.
012:010
And
there
was
a
famine
in
the
land:
and
Abram
went
down
into
Egypt
to
sojourn
there;
for
the
famine
was
grievous
in
the
land.
012:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
was
come
near
to
enter
into
Egypt,
that
he
said
unto
Sarai
his
wife,
Behold
now,
I
know
that
thou
art
a
fair
woman
to
look
upon:
012:012
Therefore
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
the
Egyptians
shall
see
thee,
that
they
shall
say,
This
is
his
wife:
and
they
will
kill
me,
but
they
will
save
thee
alive.
012:013
Say,
I
pray
thee,
thou
art
my
sister:
that
it
may
be
well
with
me
for
thy
sake;
and
my
soul
shall
live
because
of
thee.
012:014
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
Abram
was
come
into
Egypt,
the
Egyptians
beheld
the
woman
that
she
was
very
fair.
012:015
The
princes
also
of
Pharaoh
saw
her,
and
commended
her
before
Pharaoh:
and
the
woman
was
taken
into
Pharaoh's
house.
012:016
And
he
entreated
Abram
well
for
her
sake:
and
he
had
sheep,
and
oxen,
and
he
asses,
and
menservants,
and
maidservants,
and
she
asses,
and
camels.
012:017
And
the
LORD
plagued
Pharaoh
and
his
house
with
great
plagues
because
of
Sarai
Abram's
wife.
012:018
And
Pharaoh
called
Abram
and
said,
What
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
unto
me?
why
didst
thou
not
tell
me
that
she
was
thy
wife?
012:019
Why
saidst
thou,
She
is
my
sister?
so
I
might
have
taken
her
to
me
to
wife:
now
therefore
behold
thy
wife,
take
her,
and
go
thy
way.
012:020
And
Pharaoh
commanded
his
men
concerning
him:
and
they
sent
him
away,
and
his
wife,
and
all
that
he
had.
013:001
And
Abram
went
up
out
of
Egypt,
he,
and
his
wife,
and
all
that
he
had,
and
Lot
with
him,
into
the
south.
013:002
And
Abram
was
very
rich
in
cattle,
in
silver,
and
in
gold.
013:003
And
he
went
on
his
journeys
from
the
south
even
to
Bethel,
unto
the
place
where
his
tent
had
been
at
the
beginning,
between
Bethel
and
Hai;
013:004
Unto
the
place
of
the
altar,
which
he
had
make
there
at
the
first:
and
there
Abram
called
on
the
name
of
the
LORD.
013:005
And
Lot
also,
which
went
with
Abram,
had
flocks,
and
herds,
and
tents.
013:006
And
the
land
was
not
able
to
bear
them,
that
they
might
dwell
together:
for
their
substance
was
great,
so
that
they
could
not
dwell
together.
013:007
And
there
was
a
strife
between
the
herdmen
of
Abram's
cattle
and
the
herdmen
of
Lot's
cattle:
and
the
Canaanite
and
the
Perizzite
dwelled
then
in
the
land.
013:008
And
Abram
said
unto
Lot,
Let
there
be
no
strife,
I
pray
thee,
between
me
and
thee,
and
between
my
herdmen
and
thy
herdmen;
for
we
be
brethren.
013:009
Is
not
the
whole
land
before
thee?
separate
thyself,
I
pray
thee,
from
me:
if
thou
wilt
take
the
left
hand,
then
I
will
go
to
the
right;
or
if
thou
depart
to
the
right
hand,
then
I
will
go
to
the
left.
013:010
And
Lot
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
beheld
all
the
plain
of
Jordan,
that
it
was
well
watered
every
where,
before
the
LORD
destroyed
Sodom
and
Gomorrah,
even
as
the
garden
of
the
LORD,
like
the
land
of
Egypt,
as
thou
comest
unto
Zoar.
013:011
Then
Lot
chose
him
all
the
plain
of
Jordan;
and
Lot
journeyed
east:
and
they
separated
themselves
the
one
from
the
other.
013:012
Abram
dwelled
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
Lot
dwelled
in
the
cities
of
the
plain,
and
pitched
his
tent
toward
Sodom.
013:013
But
the
men
of
Sodom
were
wicked
and
sinners
before
the
LORD
exceedingly.
013:014
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Abram,
after
that
Lot
was
separated
from
him,
Lift
up
now
thine
eyes,
and
look
from
the
place
where
