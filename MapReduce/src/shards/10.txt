away:
but
Moses
stood
up
and
helped
them,
and
watered
their
flock.
002:018
And
when
they
came
to
Reuel
their
father,
he
said,
How
is
it
that
ye
are
come
so
soon
to
day?
002:019
And
they
said,
An
Egyptian
delivered
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
shepherds,
and
also
drew
water
enough
for
us,
and
watered
the
flock.
002:020
And
he
said
unto
his
daughters,
And
where
is
he?
why
is
it
that
ye
have
left
the
man?
call
him,
that
he
may
eat
bread.
002:021
And
Moses
was
content
to
dwell
with
the
man:
and
he
gave
Moses
Zipporah
his
daughter.
002:022
And
she
bare
him
a
son,
and
he
called
his
name
Gershom:
for
he
said,
I
have
been
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land.
002:023
And
it
came
to
pass
in
process
of
time,
that
the
king
of
Egypt
died:
and
the
children
of
Israel
sighed
by
reason
of
the
bondage,
and
they
cried,
and
their
cry
came
up
unto
God
by
reason
of
the
bondage.
002:024
And
God
heard
their
groaning,
and
God
remembered
his
covenant
with
Abraham,
with
Isaac,
and
with
Jacob.
002:025
And
God
looked
upon
the
children
of
Israel,
and
God
had
respect
unto
them.
003:001
Now
Moses
kept
the
flock
of
Jethro
his
father
in
law,
the
priest
of
Midian:
and
he
led
the
flock
to
the
backside
of
the
desert,
and
came
to
the
mountain
of
God,
even
to
Horeb.
003:002
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him
in
a
flame
of
fire
out
of
the
midst
of
a
bush:
and
he
looked,
and,
behold,
the
bush
burned
with
fire,
and
the
bush
was
not
consumed.
003:003
And
Moses
said,
I
will
now
turn
aside,
and
see
this
great
sight,
why
the
bush
is
not
burnt.
003:004
And
when
the
LORD
saw
that
he
turned
aside
to
see,
God
called
unto
him
out
of
the
midst
of
the
bush,
and
said,
Moses,
Moses.
And
he
said,
Here
am
I.
003:005
And
he
said,
Draw
not
nigh
hither:
put
off
thy
shoes
from
off
thy
feet,
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
is
holy
ground.
003:006
Moreover
he
said,
I
am
the
God
of
thy
father,
the
God
of
Abraham,
the
God
of
Isaac,
and
the
God
of
Jacob.
And
Moses
hid
his
face;
for
he
was
afraid
to
look
upon
God.
003:007
And
the
LORD
said,
I
have
surely
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
which
are
in
Egypt,
and
have
heard
their
cry
by
reason
of
their
taskmasters;
for
I
know
their
sorrows;
003:008
And
I
am
come
down
to
deliver
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians,
and
to
bring
them
up
out
of
that
land
unto
a
good
land
and
a
large,
unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey;
unto
the
place
of
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Hittites,
and
the
Amorites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites.
003:009
Now
therefore,
behold,
the
cry
of
the
children
of
Israel
is
come
unto
me:
and
I
have
also
seen
the
oppression
wherewith
the
Egyptians
oppress
them.
003:010
Come
now
therefore,
and
I
will
send
thee
unto
Pharaoh,
that
thou
mayest
bring
forth
my
people
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
Egypt.
003:011
And
Moses
said
unto
God,
Who
am
I,
that
I
should
go
unto
Pharaoh,
and
that
I
should
bring
forth
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
Egypt?
003:012
And
he
said,
Certainly
I
will
be
with
thee;
and
this
shall
be
a
token
unto
thee,
that
I
have
sent
thee:
When
thou
hast
brought
forth
the
people
out
of
Egypt,
ye
shall
serve
God
upon
this
mountain.
003:013
And
Moses
said
unto
God,
Behold,
when
I
come
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
shall
say
unto
them,
The
God
of
your
fathers
hath
sent
me
unto
you;
and
they
shall
say
to
me,
What
is
his
name?
what
shall
I
say
unto
them?
003:014
And
God
said
unto
Moses,
I
AM
THAT
I
AM:
and
he
said,
Thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
I
AM
hath
sent
me
unto
you.
003:015
And
God
said
moreover
unto
Moses,
Thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers,
the
God
of
Abraham,
the
God
of
Isaac,
and
the
God
of
Jacob,
hath
sent
me
unto
you:
this
is
my
name
for
ever,
and
this
is
my
memorial
unto
all
generations.
003:016
Go,
and
gather
the
elders
of
Israel
together,
and
say
unto
them,
The
LORD
God
of
your
fathers,
the
God
of
Abraham,
of
Isaac,
and
of
Jacob,
appeared
unto
me,
saying,
I
have
surely
visited
you,
and
seen
that
which
is
done
to
you
in
Egypt:
003:017
And
I
have
said,
I
will
bring
you
up
out
of
the
affliction
of
Egypt
unto
the
land
of
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Hittites,
and
the
Amorites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites,
unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey.
003:018
And
they
shall
hearken
to
thy
voice:
and
thou
shalt
come,
thou
and
the
elders
of
Israel,
unto
the
king
of
Egypt,
and
ye
shall
say
unto
him,
The
LORD
God
of
the
Hebrews
hath
met
with
us:
and
now
let
us
go,
we
beseech
thee,
three
days'
journey
into
the
wilderness,
that
we
may
sacrifice
to
the
LORD
our
God.
003:019
And
I
am
sure
that
the
king
of
Egypt
will
not
let
you
go,
no,
not
by
a
mighty
hand.
003:020
And
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand,
and
smite
Egypt
with
all
my
wonders
which
I
will
do
in
the
midst
thereof:
and
after
that
he
will
let
you
go.
003:021
And
I
will
give
this
people
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
Egyptians:
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that,
when
ye
go,
ye
shall
not
go
empty.
003:022
But
every
woman
shall
borrow
of
her
neighbour,
and
of
her
that
sojourneth
in
her
house,
jewels
of
silver,
and
jewels
of
gold,
and
raiment:
and
ye
shall
put
them
upon
your
sons,
and
upon
your
daughters;
and
ye
shall
spoil
the
Egyptians.
004:001
And
Moses
answered
and
said,
But,
behold,
they
will
not
believe
me,
nor
hearken
unto
my
voice:
for
they
will
say,
The
LORD
hath
not
appeared
unto
thee.
004:002
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
What
is
that
in
thine
hand?
And
he
said,
A
rod.
004:003
And
he
said,
Cast
it
on
the
ground.
And
he
cast
it
on
the
ground,
and
it
became
a
serpent;
and
Moses
fled
from
before
it.
004:004
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Put
forth
thine
hand,
and
take
it
by
the
tail.
And
he
put
forth
his
hand,
and
caught
it,
and
it
became
a
rod
in
his
hand:
004:005
That
they
may
believe
that
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers,
the
God
of
Abraham,
the
God
of
Isaac,
and
the
God
of
Jacob,
hath
appeared
unto
thee.
004:006
And
the
LORD
said
furthermore
unto
him,
Put
now
thine
hand
into
thy
bosom.
And
he
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom:
and
when
he
took
it
out,
behold,
his
hand
was
leprous
as
snow.
004:007
And
he
said,
Put
thine
hand
into
thy
bosom
again.
And
he
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom
again;
and
plucked
it
out
of
his
bosom,
and,
behold,
it
was
turned
again
as
his
other
flesh.
004:008
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
they
will
not
believe
thee,
neither
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
first
sign,
that
they
will
believe
the
voice
of
the
latter
sign.
004:009
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
they
will
not
believe
also
these
two
signs,
neither
hearken
unto
thy
voice,
that
thou
shalt
take
of
the
water
of
the
river,
and
pour
it
upon
the
dry
land:
and
the
water
which
thou
takest
out
of
the
river
shall
become
blood
upon
the
dry
land.
004:010
And
Moses
said
unto
the
LORD,
O
my
LORD,
I
am
not
eloquent,
neither
heretofore,
nor
since
thou
hast
spoken
unto
thy
servant:
but
I
am
slow
of
speech,
and
of
a
slow
tongue.
004:011
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Who
hath
made
man's
mouth?
or
who
maketh
the
dumb,
or
deaf,
or
the
seeing,
or
the
blind?
have
not
I
the
LORD?
004:012
Now
therefore
go,
and
I
will
be
with
thy
mouth,
and
teach
thee
what
thou
shalt
say.
004:013
And
he
said,
O
my
LORD,
send,
I
pray
thee,
by
the
hand
of
him
whom
thou
wilt
send.
004:014
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Moses,
and
he
said,
Is
not
Aaron
the
Levite
thy
brother?
I
know
that
he
can
speak
well.
And
also,
behold,
he
cometh
forth
to
meet
thee:
and
when
he
seeth
thee,
he
will
be
glad
in
his
heart.
004:015
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him,
and
put
words
in
his
mouth:
and
I
will
be
with
thy
mouth,
and
with
his
mouth,
and
will
teach
you
what
ye
shall
do.
004:016
And
he
shall
be
thy
spokesman
unto
the
people:
and
he
shall
be,
even
he
shall
be
to
thee
instead
of
a
mouth,
and
thou
shalt
be
to
him
instead
of
God.
004:017
And
thou
shalt
take
this
rod
in
thine
hand,
wherewith
thou
shalt
do
signs.
004:018
And
Moses
went
and
returned
to
Jethro
his
father
in
law,
and
said
unto
him,
Let
me
go,
I
pray
thee,
and
return
unto
my
brethren
which
are
in
Egypt,
and
see
whether
they
be
yet
alive.
And
Jethro
said
to
Moses,
Go
in
peace.
004:019
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses
in
Midian,
Go,
return
into
Egypt:
for
all
the
men
are
dead
which
sought
thy
life.
004:020
And
Moses
took
his
wife
and
his
sons,
and
set
them
upon
an
ass,
and
he
returned
to
the
land
of
Egypt:
and
Moses
took
the
rod
of
God
in
his
hand.
004:021
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
When
thou
goest
to
return
into
Egypt,
see
that
thou
do
all
those
wonders
before
Pharaoh,
which
I
have
put
in
thine
hand:
but
I
will
harden
his
heart,
that
he
shall
not
let
the
people
go.
004:022
And
thou
shalt
say
unto
Pharaoh,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Israel
is
my
son,
even
my
firstborn:
004:023
And
I
say
unto
thee,
Let
my
son
go,
that
he
may
serve
me:
and
if
thou
refuse
to
let
him
go,
behold,
I
will
slay
thy
son,
even
thy
firstborn.
004:024
And
it
came
to
pass
by
the
way
in
the
inn,
that
the
LORD
met
him,
and
sought
to
kill
him.
004:025
Then
Zipporah
took
a
sharp
stone,
and
cut
off
the
foreskin
of
her
son,
and
cast
it
at
his
feet,
and
said,
Surely
a
bloody
husband
art
thou
to
me.
004:026
So
he
let
him
go:
then
she
said,
A
bloody
husband
thou
art,
because
of
the
circumcision.
004:027
And
the
LORD
said
to
Aaron,
Go
into
the
wilderness
to
meet
Moses.
And
he
went,
and
met
him
in
the
mount
of
God,
and
kissed
him.
004:028
And
Moses
told
Aaron
all
the
words
of
the
LORD
who
had
sent
him,
and
all
the
signs
which
he
had
commanded
him.
004:029
And
Moses
and
Aaron
went
and
gathered
together
all
the
elders
of
the
children
of
Israel:
004:030
And
Aaron
spake
all
the
words
which
the
LORD
had
spoken
unto
Moses,
and
did
the
signs
in
the
sight
of
the
people.
004:031
And
the
people
believed:
and
when
they
heard
that
the
LORD
had
visited
the
children
of
Israel,
and
that
he
had
looked
upon
their
affliction,
then
they
bowed
their
heads
and
worshipped.
005:001
And
afterward
Moses
and
Aaron
went
in,
and
told
Pharaoh,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Let
my
people
go,
that
they
may
hold
a
feast
unto
me
in
the
wilderness.
005:002
And
Pharaoh
said,
Who
is
the
LORD,
that
I
should
obey
his
voice
to
let
Israel
go?
I
know
not
the
LORD,
neither
will
I
let
Israel
go.
005:003
And
they
said,
The
God
of
the
Hebrews
hath
met
with
us:
let
us
go,
we
pray
thee,
three
days'
journey
into
the
desert,
and
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
our
God;
lest
he
fall
upon
us
with
pestilence,
or
with
the
sword.
005:004
And
the
king
of
Egypt
said
unto
them,
Wherefore
do
ye,
Moses
and
Aaron,
let
the
people
from
their
works?
get
you
unto
your
burdens.
005:005
And
Pharaoh
said,
Behold,
the
people
of
the
land
now
are
many,
and
ye
make
them
rest
from
their
burdens.
005:006
And
Pharaoh
commanded
the
same
day
the
taskmasters
of
the
people,
and
their
officers,
saying,
005:007
Ye
shall
no
more
give
the
people
straw
to
make
brick,
as
heretofore:
let
them
go
and
gather
straw
for
themselves.
005:008
And
the
tale
of
the
bricks,
which
they
did
make
heretofore,
ye
shall
lay
upon
them;
ye
shall
not
diminish
ought
thereof:
for
they
be
idle;
therefore
they
cry,
saying,
Let
us
go
and
sacrifice
to
our
God.
005:009
Let
there
more
work
be
laid
upon
the
men,
that
they
may
labour
therein;
and
let
them
not
regard
vain
words.
005:010
And
the
taskmasters
of
the
people
went
out,
and
their
officers,
and
they
spake
to
the
people,
saying,
Thus
saith
Pharaoh,
I
will
not
give
you
straw.
005:011
Go
ye,
get
you
straw
where
ye
can
find
it:
yet
not
ought
of
your
work
shall
be
diminished.
005:012
So
the
people
were
scattered
abroad
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt
to
gather
stubble
instead
of
straw.
005:013
And
the
taskmasters
hasted
them,
saying,
Fulfil
your
works,
your
daily
tasks,
as
when
there
was
straw.
005:014
And
the
officers
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
Pharaoh's
taskmasters
had
set
over
them,
were
beaten,
and
demanded,
Wherefore
have
ye
not
fulfilled
your
task
in
making
brick
both
yesterday
and
to
day,
as
heretofore?
005:015
Then
the
officers
of
the
children
of
Israel
came
and
cried
unto
Pharaoh,
saying,
Wherefore
dealest
thou
thus
with
thy
servants?
005:016
There
is
no
straw
given
unto
thy
servants,
and
they
say
to
us,
Make
brick:
and,
behold,
thy
servants
are
beaten;
but
the
fault
is
in
thine
own
people.
005:017
But
he
said,
Ye
are
idle,
ye
are
idle:
therefore
ye
say,
Let
us
go
and
do
sacrifice
to
the
LORD.
005:018
Go
therefore
now,
and
work;
for
there
shall
no
straw
be
given
you,
yet
shall
ye
deliver
the
tale
of
bricks.
005:019
And
the
officers
of
the
children
of
Israel
did
see
that
they
were
in
evil
case,
after
it
was
said,
Ye
shall
not
minish
ought
from
your
bricks
of
your
daily
task.
005:020
And
they
met
Moses
and
Aaron,
who
stood
in
the
way,
as
they
came
forth
from
Pharaoh:
005:021
And
they
said
unto
them,
The
LORD
look
upon
you,
and
judge;
because
ye
have
made
our
savour
to
be
abhorred
in
the
eyes
of
Pharaoh,
and
in
the
eyes
of
his
servants,
to
put
a
sword
in
their
hand
to
slay
us.
005:022
And
Moses
returned
unto
the
LORD,
and
said,
LORD,
wherefore
hast
thou
so
evil
entreated
this
people?
why
is
it
that
thou
hast
sent
me?
005:023
For
since
I
came
to
Pharaoh
to
speak
in
thy
name,
he
hath
done
evil
to
this
people;
neither
hast
thou
delivered
thy
people
at
all.
006:001
Then
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Now
shalt
thou
see
what
I
will
do
to
Pharaoh:
for
with
a
strong
hand
shall
he
let
them
go,
and
with
a
strong
hand
shall
he
drive
them
out
of
his
land.
006:002
And
God
spake
unto
Moses,
and
said
unto
him,
I
am
the
LORD:
006:003
And
I
appeared
unto
Abraham,
unto
Isaac,
and
unto
Jacob,
by
the
name
of
God
Almighty,
but
by
my
name
JEHOVAH
was
I
not
known
to
them.
006:004
And
I
have
also
established
my
covenant
with
them,
to
give
them
the
land
of
Canaan,
the
land
of
their
pilgrimage,
wherein
they
were
strangers.
006:005
And
I
have
also
heard
the
groaning
of
the
children
of
Israel,
whom
the
Egyptians
keep
in
bondage;
and
I
have
remembered
my
covenant.
006:006
Wherefore
say
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
I
am
the
LORD,
and
I
will
bring
you
out
from
under
the
burdens
of
the
Egyptians,
and
I
will
rid
you
out
of
their
bondage,
and
I
will
redeem
you
with
a
stretched
out
arm,
and
with
great
judgments:
006:007
And
I
will
take
you
to
me
for
a
people,
and
I
will
be
to
you
a
God:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
your
God,
which
bringeth
you
out
from
under
the
burdens
of
the
Egyptians.
006:008
And
I
will
bring
you
in
unto
the
land,
concerning
the
which
I
did
swear
to
give
it
to
Abraham,
to
Isaac,
and
to
Jacob;
and
I
will
give
it
you
for
an
heritage:
I
am
the
LORD.
006:009
And
Moses
spake
so
unto
the
children
of
Israel:
but
they
hearkened
not
unto
Moses
for
anguish
of
spirit,
and
for
cruel
bondage.
006:010
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
006:011
Go
in,
speak
unto
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
that
he
let
the
children
of
Israel
go
out
of
his
land.
006:012
And
Moses
spake
before
the
LORD,
saying,
Behold,
the
children
of
Israel
have
not
hearkened
unto
me;
how
then
shall
Pharaoh
hear
me,
who
am
of
uncircumcised
lips?
006:013
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron,
and
gave
them
a
charge
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
unto
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
to
bring
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
006:014
These
be
the
heads
of
their
fathers'
houses:
The
sons
of
Reuben
the
firstborn
of
Israel;
Hanoch,
and
Pallu,
Hezron,
and
Carmi:
these
be
the
families
of
Reuben.
006:015
And
the
sons
of
Simeon;
Jemuel,
and
Jamin,
and
Ohad,
and
Jachin,
and
Zohar,
and
Shaul
the
son
of
a
Canaanitish
woman:
these
are
the
families
of
Simeon.
006:016
And
these
are
the
names
of
the
sons
of
Levi
according
to
their
generations;
Gershon,
and
Kohath,
and
Merari:
and
the
years
of
the
life
of
Levi
were
an
hundred
thirty
and
seven
years.
006:017
The
sons
of
Gershon;
Libni,
and
Shimi,
according
to
their
families.
006:018
And
the
sons
of
Kohath;
Amram,
and
Izhar,
and
Hebron,
and
Uzziel:
and
the
years
of
the
life
of
Kohath
were
an
hundred
thirty
and
three
years.
006:019
And
the
sons
of
Merari;
Mahali
and
Mushi:
these
are
the
families
of
Levi
according
to
their
generations.
006:020
And
Amram
took
him
Jochebed
his
father's
sister
to
wife;
and
she
bare
him
Aaron
and
Moses:
and
the
years
of
the
life
of
Amram
were
an
hundred
and
thirty
and
seven
years.
006:021
And
the
sons
of
Izhar;
Korah,
and
Nepheg,
and
Zichri.
006:022
And
the
sons
of
Uzziel;
Mishael,
and
Elzaphan,
and
Zithri.
006:023
And
Aaron
took
him
Elisheba,
daughter
of
Amminadab,
sister
of
Naashon,
to
wife;
and
she
bare
him
Nadab,
and
Abihu,
Eleazar,
and
Ithamar.
006:024
And
the
sons
of
Korah;
Assir,
and
Elkanah,
and
Abiasaph:
these
are
the
families
of
the
Korhites.
006:025
And
Eleazar
Aaron's
son
took
him
one
of
the
daughters
of
Putiel
to
wife;
and
she
bare
him
Phinehas:
these
are
the
heads
of
the
fathers
of
the
Levites
according
to
their
families.
006:026
These
are
that
Aaron
and
Moses,
to
whom
the
LORD
said,
Bring
out
the
children
of
Israel
from
the
land
of
Egypt
according
to
their
armies.
006:027
These
are
they
which
spake
to
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
to
bring
out
the
children
of
Israel
from
Egypt:
these
are
that
Moses
and
Aaron.
006:028
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
day
when
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
006:029
That
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
I
am
the
LORD:
speak
thou
unto
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
all
that
I
say
unto
thee.
006:030
And
Moses
said
before
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
am
of
uncircumcised
lips,
and
how
shall
Pharaoh
hearken
unto
me?
007:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
See,
I
have
made
thee
a
god
to
Pharaoh:
and
Aaron
thy
brother
shall
be
thy
prophet.
007:002
Thou
shalt
speak
all
that
I
command
thee:
and
Aaron
thy
brother
shall
speak
unto
Pharaoh,
that
he
send
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
his
land.
007:003
And
I
will
harden
Pharaoh's
heart,
and
multiply
my
signs
and
my
wonders
in
the
land
of
Egypt.
007:004
But
Pharaoh
shall
not
hearken
unto
you,
that
I
may
lay
my
hand
upon
Egypt,
and
bring
forth
mine
armies,
and
my
people
the
children
of
Israel,
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
by
great
judgments.
007:005
And
the
Egyptians
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
stretch
forth
mine
hand
upon
Egypt,
and
bring
out
the
children
of
Israel
from
among
them.
007:006
And
Moses
and
Aaron
did
as
the
LORD
commanded
them,
so
did
they.
007:007
And
Moses
was
fourscore
years
old,
and
Aaron
fourscore
and
three
years
old,
when
they
spake
unto
Pharaoh.
007:008
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron,
saying,
007:009
When
Pharaoh
shall
speak
unto
you,
saying,
Shew
a
miracle
for
you:
then
thou
shalt
say
unto
Aaron,
Take
thy
rod,
and
cast
it
before
Pharaoh,
and
it
shall
become
a
serpent.
007:010
And
Moses
and
Aaron
went
in
unto
Pharaoh,
and
they
did
so
as
the
LORD
had
commanded:
and
Aaron
cast
down
his
rod
before
Pharaoh,
and
before
his
servants,
and
it
became
a
serpent.
007:011
Then
Pharaoh
also
called
the
wise
men
and
the
sorcerers:
now
the
magicians
of
Egypt,
they
also
did
in
like
manner
with
their
enchantments.
007:012
For
they
cast
down
every
man
his
rod,
and
they
became
serpents:
but
Aaron's
rod
swallowed
up
their
rods.
007:013
And
he
hardened
Pharaoh's
heart,
that
he
hearkened
not
unto
them;
as
the
LORD
had
said.
007:014
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Pharaoh's
heart
is
hardened,
he
refuseth
to
let
the
people
go.
007:015
Get
thee
unto
Pharaoh
in
the
morning;
lo,
he
goeth
out
unto
the
water;
and
thou
shalt
stand
by
the
river's
brink
against
he
come;
and
the
rod
which
was
turned
to
a
serpent
shalt
thou
take
in
thine
hand.
007:016
And
thou
shalt
say
unto
him,
The
LORD
God
of
the
Hebrews
hath
sent
me
unto
thee,
saying,
Let
my
people
go,
that
they
may
serve
me
in
the
wilderness:
and,
behold,
hitherto
thou
wouldest
not
hear.
007:017
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
In
this
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
LORD:
behold,
I
will
smite
with
the
rod
that
is
in
mine
hand
upon
the
waters
which
are
in
the
river,
and
they
shall
be
turned
to
blood.
007:018
And
the
fish
that
is
in
the
river
shall
die,
and
the
river
shall
stink;
and
the
Egyptians
shall
lothe
to
drink
of
the
water
of
the
river.
007:019
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
Say
unto
Aaron,
Take
thy
rod,
and
stretch
out
thine
hand
upon
the
waters
of
Egypt,
upon
their
streams,
upon
their
rivers,
and
upon
their
ponds,
and
upon
all
their
pools
of
water,
that
they
may
become
blood;
and
that
there
may
be
blood
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt,
both
in
vessels
of
wood,
and
in
vessels
of
stone.
007:020
And
Moses
and
Aaron
did
so,
as
the
LORD
commanded;
and
he
lifted
up
the
rod,
and
smote
the
waters
that
were
in
the
river,
in
the
sight
of
Pharaoh,
and
in
the
sight
of
his
servants;
and
all
the
waters
that
were
in
the
river
were
turned
to
blood.
007:021
And
the
fish
that
was
in
the
river
died;
and
the
river
stank,
and
the
Egyptians
could
not
drink
of
the
water
of
the
river;
and
there
was
blood
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
007:022
And
the
magicians
of
Egypt
did
so
with
their
enchantments:
and
Pharaoh's
heart
was
hardened,
neither
did
he
hearken
unto
them;
as
the
LORD
had
said.
007:023
And
Pharaoh
turned
and
went
into
his
house,
neither
did
he
set
his
heart
to
this
also.
007:024
And
all
the
Egyptians
digged
round
about
the
river
for
water
to
drink;
for
they
could
not
drink
of
the
water
of
the
river.
007:025
And
seven
days
were
fulfilled,
after
that
the
LORD
had
smitten
the
river.
008:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
Go
unto
Pharaoh,
and
say
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Let
my
people
go,
that
they
may
serve
me.
008:002
And
if
thou
refuse
to
let
them
go,
behold,
I
will
smite
