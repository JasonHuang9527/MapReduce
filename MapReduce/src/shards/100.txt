Yea,
in
heart
ye
work
wickedness;
ye
weigh
the
violence
of
your
hands
in
the
earth.
058:003
The
wicked
are
estranged
from
the
womb:
they
go
astray
as
soon
as
they
be
born,
speaking
lies.
058:004
Their
poison
is
like
the
poison
of
a
serpent:
they
are
like
the
deaf
adder
that
stoppeth
her
ear;
058:005
Which
will
not
hearken
to
the
voice
of
charmers,
charming
never
so
wisely.
058:006
Break
their
teeth,
O
God,
in
their
mouth:
break
out
the
great
teeth
of
the
young
lions,
O
LORD.
058:007
Let
them
melt
away
as
waters
which
run
continually:
when
he
bendeth
his
bow
to
shoot
his
arrows,
let
them
be
as
cut
in
pieces.
058:008
As
a
snail
which
melteth,
let
every
one
of
them
pass
away:
like
the
untimely
birth
of
a
woman,
that
they
may
not
see
the
sun.
058:009
Before
your
pots
can
feel
the
thorns,
he
shall
take
them
away
as
with
a
whirlwind,
both
living,
and
in
his
wrath.
058:010
The
righteous
shall
rejoice
when
he
seeth
the
vengeance:
he
shall
wash
his
feet
in
the
blood
of
the
wicked.
058:011
So
that
a
man
shall
say,
Verily
there
is
a
reward
for
the
righteous:
verily
he
is
a
God
that
judgeth
in
the
earth.
059:001
Deliver
me
from
mine
enemies,
O
my
God:
defend
me
from
them
that
rise
up
against
me.
059:002
Deliver
me
from
the
workers
of
iniquity,
and
save
me
from
bloody
men.
059:003
For,
lo,
they
lie
in
wait
for
my
soul:
the
mighty
are
gathered
against
me;
not
for
my
transgression,
nor
for
my
sin,
O
LORD.
059:004
They
run
and
prepare
themselves
without
my
fault:
awake
to
help
me,
and
behold.
059:005
Thou
therefore,
O
LORD
God
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
awake
to
visit
all
the
heathen:
be
not
merciful
to
any
wicked
transgressors.
Selah.
059:006
They
return
at
evening:
they
make
a
noise
like
a
dog,
and
go
round
about
the
city.
059:007
Behold,
they
belch
out
with
their
mouth:
swords
are
in
their
lips:
for
who,
say
they,
doth
hear?
059:008
But
thou,
O
LORD,
shalt
laugh
at
them;
thou
shalt
have
all
the
heathen
in
derision.
059:009
Because
of
his
strength
will
I
wait
upon
thee:
for
God
is
my
defence.
059:010
The
God
of
my
mercy
shall
prevent
me:
God
shall
let
me
see
my
desire
upon
mine
enemies.
059:011
Slay
them
not,
lest
my
people
forget:
scatter
them
by
thy
power;
and
bring
them
down,
O
Lord
our
shield.
059:012
For
the
sin
of
their
mouth
and
the
words
of
their
lips
let
them
even
be
taken
in
their
pride:
and
for
cursing
and
lying
which
they
speak.
059:013
Consume
them
in
wrath,
consume
them,
that
they
may
not
be:
and
let
them
know
that
God
ruleth
in
Jacob
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth.
Selah.
059:014
And
at
evening
let
them
return;
and
let
them
make
a
noise
like
a
dog,
and
go
round
about
the
city.
059:015
Let
them
wander
up
and
down
for
meat,
and
grudge
if
they
be
not
satisfied.
059:016
But
I
will
sing
of
thy
power;
yea,
I
will
sing
aloud
of
thy
mercy
in
the
morning:
for
thou
hast
been
my
defence
and
refuge
in
the
day
of
my
trouble.
059:017
Unto
thee,
O
my
strength,
will
I
sing:
for
God
is
my
defence,
and
the
God
of
my
mercy.
060:001
O
God,
thou
hast
cast
us
off,
thou
hast
scattered
us,
thou
hast
been
displeased;
O
turn
thyself
to
us
again.
060:002
Thou
hast
made
the
earth
to
tremble;
thou
hast
broken
it:
heal
the
breaches
thereof;
for
it
shaketh.
060:003
Thou
hast
shewed
thy
people
hard
things:
thou
hast
made
us
to
drink
the
wine
of
astonishment.
060:004
Thou
hast
given
a
banner
to
them
that
fear
thee,
that
it
may
be
displayed
because
of
the
truth.
Selah.
060:005
That
thy
beloved
may
be
delivered;
save
with
thy
right
hand,
and
hear
me.
060:006
God
hath
spoken
in
his
holiness;
I
will
rejoice,
I
will
divide
Shechem,
and
mete
out
the
valley
of
Succoth.
060:007
Gilead
is
mine,
and
Manasseh
is
mine;
Ephraim
also
is
the
strength
of
mine
head;
Judah
is
my
lawgiver;
060:008
Moab
is
my
washpot;
over
Edom
will
I
cast
out
my
shoe:
Philistia,
triumph
thou
because
of
me.
060:009
Who
will
bring
me
into
the
strong
city?
who
will
lead
me
into
Edom?
060:010
Wilt
not
thou,
O
God,
which
hadst
cast
us
off?
and
thou,
O
God,
which
didst
not
go
out
with
our
armies?
060:011
Give
us
help
from
trouble:
for
vain
is
the
help
of
man.
060:012
Through
God
we
shall
do
valiantly:
for
he
it
is
that
shall
tread
down
our
enemies.
061:001
Hear
my
cry,
O
God;
attend
unto
my
prayer.
061:002
From
the
end
of
the
earth
will
I
cry
unto
thee,
when
my
heart
is
overwhelmed:
lead
me
to
the
rock
that
is
higher
than
I.
061:003
For
thou
hast
been
a
shelter
for
me,
and
a
strong
tower
from
the
enemy.
061:004
I
will
abide
in
thy
tabernacle
for
ever:
I
will
trust
in
the
covert
of
thy
wings.
Selah.
061:005
For
thou,
O
God,
hast
heard
my
vows:
thou
hast
given
me
the
heritage
of
those
that
fear
thy
name.
061:006
Thou
wilt
prolong
the
king's
life:
and
his
years
as
many
generations.
061:007
He
shall
abide
before
God
for
ever:
O
prepare
mercy
and
truth,
which
may
preserve
him.
061:008
So
will
I
sing
praise
unto
thy
name
for
ever,
that
I
may
daily
perform
my
vows.
062:001
Truly
my
soul
waiteth
upon
God:
from
him
cometh
my
salvation.
062:002
He
only
is
my
rock
and
my
salvation;
he
is
my
defence;
I
shall
not
be
greatly
moved.
062:003
How
long
will
ye
imagine
mischief
against
a
man?
ye
shall
be
slain
all
of
you:
as
a
bowing
wall
shall
ye
be,
and
as
a
tottering
fence.
062:004
They
only
consult
to
cast
him
down
from
his
excellency:
they
delight
in
lies:
they
bless
with
their
mouth,
but
they
curse
inwardly.
Selah.
062:005
My
soul,
wait
thou
only
upon
God;
for
my
expectation
is
from
him.
062:006
He
only
is
my
rock
and
my
salvation:
he
is
my
defence;
I
shall
not
be
moved.
062:007
In
God
is
my
salvation
and
my
glory:
the
rock
of
my
strength,
and
my
refuge,
is
in
God.
062:008
Trust
in
him
at
all
times;
ye
people,
pour
out
your
heart
before
him:
God
is
a
refuge
for
us.
Selah.
062:009
Surely
men
of
low
degree
are
vanity,
and
men
of
high
degree
are
a
lie:
to
be
laid
in
the
balance,
they
are
altogether
lighter
than
vanity.
062:010
Trust
not
in
oppression,
and
become
not
vain
in
robbery:
if
riches
increase,
set
not
your
heart
upon
them.
062:011
God
hath
spoken
once;
twice
have
I
heard
this;
that
power
belongeth
unto
God.
062:012
Also
unto
thee,
O
Lord,
belongeth
mercy:
for
thou
renderest
to
every
man
according
to
his
work.
063:001
O
God,
thou
art
my
God;
early
will
I
seek
thee:
my
soul
thirsteth
for
thee,
my
flesh
longeth
for
thee
in
a
dry
and
thirsty
land,
where
no
water
is;
063:002
To
see
thy
power
and
thy
glory,
so
as
I
have
seen
thee
in
the
sanctuary.
063:003
Because
thy
lovingkindness
is
better
than
life,
my
lips
shall
praise
thee.
063:004
Thus
will
I
bless
thee
while
I
live:
I
will
lift
up
my
hands
in
thy
name.
063:005
My
soul
shall
be
satisfied
as
with
marrow
and
fatness;
and
my
mouth
shall
praise
thee
with
joyful
lips:
063:006
When
I
remember
thee
upon
my
bed,
and
meditate
on
thee
in
the
night
watches.
063:007
Because
thou
hast
been
my
help,
therefore
in
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
will
I
rejoice.
063:008
My
soul
followeth
hard
after
thee:
thy
right
hand
upholdeth
me.
063:009
But
those
that
seek
my
soul,
to
destroy
it,
shall
go
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth.
063:010
They
shall
fall
by
the
sword:
they
shall
be
a
portion
for
foxes.
063:011
But
the
king
shall
rejoice
in
God;
every
one
that
sweareth
by
him
shall
glory:
but
the
mouth
of
them
that
speak
lies
shall
be
stopped.
064:001
Hear
my
voice,
O
God,
in
my
prayer:
preserve
my
life
from
fear
of
the
enemy.
064:002
Hide
me
from
the
secret
counsel
of
the
wicked;
from
the
insurrection
of
the
workers
of
iniquity:
064:003
Who
whet
their
tongue
like
a
sword,
and
bend
their
bows
to
shoot
their
arrows,
even
bitter
words:
064:004
That
they
may
shoot
in
secret
at
the
perfect:
suddenly
do
they
shoot
at
him,
and
fear
not.
064:005
They
encourage
themselves
in
an
evil
matter:
they
commune
of
laying
snares
privily;
they
say,
Who
shall
see
them?
064:006
They
search
out
iniquities;
they
accomplish
a
diligent
search:
both
the
inward
thought
of
every
one
of
them,
and
the
heart,
is
deep.
064:007
But
God
shall
shoot
at
them
with
an
arrow;
suddenly
shall
they
be
wounded.
064:008
So
they
shall
make
their
own
tongue
to
fall
upon
themselves:
all
that
see
them
shall
flee
away.
064:009
And
all
men
shall
fear,
and
shall
declare
the
work
of
God;
for
they
shall
wisely
consider
of
his
doing.
064:010
The
righteous
shall
be
glad
in
the
LORD,
and
shall
trust
in
him;
and
all
the
upright
in
heart
shall
glory.
065:001
Praise
waiteth
for
thee,
O
God,
in
Sion:
and
unto
thee
shall
the
vow
be
performed.
065:002
O
thou
that
hearest
prayer,
unto
thee
shall
all
flesh
come.
065:003
Iniquities
prevail
against
me:
as
for
our
transgressions,
thou
shalt
purge
them
away.
065:004
Blessed
is
the
man
whom
thou
choosest,
and
causest
to
approach
unto
thee,
that
he
may
dwell
in
thy
courts:
we
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
goodness
of
thy
house,
even
of
thy
holy
temple.
065:005
By
terrible
things
in
righteousness
wilt
thou
answer
us,
O
God
of
our
salvation;
who
art
the
confidence
of
all
the
ends
of
the
earth,
and
of
them
that
are
afar
off
upon
the
sea:
065:006
Which
by
his
strength
setteth
fast
the
mountains;
being
girded
with
power:
065:007
Which
stilleth
the
noise
of
the
seas,
the
noise
of
their
waves,
and
the
tumult
of
the
people.
065:008
They
also
that
dwell
in
the
uttermost
parts
are
afraid
at
thy
tokens:
thou
makest
the
outgoings
of
the
morning
and
evening
to
rejoice.
065:009
Thou
visitest
the
earth,
and
waterest
it:
thou
greatly
enrichest
it
with
the
river
of
God,
which
is
full
of
water:
thou
preparest
them
corn,
when
thou
hast
so
provided
for
it.
065:010
Thou
waterest
the
ridges
thereof
abundantly:
thou
settlest
the
furrows
thereof:
thou
makest
it
soft
with
showers:
thou
blessest
the
springing
thereof.
065:011
Thou
crownest
the
year
with
thy
goodness;
and
thy
paths
drop
fatness.
065:012
They
drop
upon
the
pastures
of
the
wilderness:
and
the
little
hills
rejoice
on
every
side.
065:013
The
pastures
are
clothed
with
flocks;
the
valleys
also
are
covered
over
with
corn;
they
shout
for
joy,
they
also
sing.
066:001
Make
a
joyful
noise
unto
God,
all
ye
lands:
066:002
Sing
forth
the
honour
of
his
name:
make
his
praise
glorious.
066:003
Say
unto
God,
How
terrible
art
thou
in
thy
works!
through
the
greatness
of
thy
power
shall
thine
enemies
submit
themselves
unto
thee.
066:004
All
the
earth
shall
worship
thee,
and
shall
sing
unto
thee;
they
shall
sing
to
thy
name.
Selah.
066:005
Come
and
see
the
works
of
God:
he
is
terrible
in
his
doing
toward
the
children
of
men.
066:006
He
turned
the
sea
into
dry
land:
they
went
through
the
flood
on
foot:
there
did
we
rejoice
in
him.
066:007
He
ruleth
by
his
power
for
ever;
his
eyes
behold
the
nations:
let
not
the
rebellious
exalt
themselves.
Selah.
066:008
O
bless
our
God,
ye
people,
and
make
the
voice
of
his
praise
to
be
heard:
066:009
Which
holdeth
our
soul
in
life,
and
suffereth
not
our
feet
to
be
moved.
066:010
For
thou,
O
God,
hast
proved
us:
thou
hast
tried
us,
as
silver
is
tried.
066:011
Thou
broughtest
us
into
the
net;
thou
laidst
affliction
upon
our
loins.
066:012
Thou
hast
caused
men
to
ride
over
our
heads;
we
went
through
fire
and
through
water:
but
thou
broughtest
us
out
into
a
wealthy
place.
066:013
I
will
go
into
thy
house
with
burnt
offerings:
I
will
pay
thee
my
vows,
066:014
Which
my
lips
have
uttered,
and
my
mouth
hath
spoken,
when
I
was
in
trouble.
066:015
I
will
offer
unto
thee
burnt
sacrifices
of
fatlings,
with
the
incense
of
rams;
I
will
offer
bullocks
with
goats.
Selah.
066:016
Come
and
hear,
all
ye
that
fear
God,
and
I
will
declare
what
he
hath
done
for
my
soul.
066:017
I
cried
unto
him
with
my
mouth,
and
he
was
extolled
with
my
tongue.
066:018
If
I
regard
iniquity
in
my
heart,
the
Lord
will
not
hear
me:
066:019
But
verily
God
hath
heard
me;
he
hath
attended
to
the
voice
of
my
prayer.
066:020
Blessed
be
God,
which
hath
not
turned
away
my
prayer,
nor
his
mercy
from
me.
067:001
God
be
merciful
unto
us,
and
bless
us;
and
cause
his
face
to
shine
upon
us;
Selah.
067:002
That
thy
way
may
be
known
upon
earth,
thy
saving
health
among
all
nations.
067:003
Let
the
people
praise
thee,
O
God;
let
all
the
people
praise
thee.
067:004
O
let
the
nations
be
glad
and
sing
for
joy:
for
thou
shalt
judge
the
people
righteously,
and
govern
the
nations
upon
earth.
Selah.
067:005
Let
the
people
praise
thee,
O
God;
let
all
the
people
praise
thee.
067:006
Then
shall
the
earth
yield
her
increase;
and
God,
even
our
own
God,
shall
bless
us.
067:007
God
shall
bless
us;
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
fear
him.
068:001
Let
God
arise,
let
his
enemies
be
scattered:
let
them
also
that
hate
him
flee
before
him.
068:002
As
smoke
is
driven
away,
so
drive
them
away:
as
wax
melteth
before
the
fire,
so
let
the
wicked
perish
at
the
presence
of
God.
068:003
But
let
the
righteous
be
glad;
let
them
rejoice
before
God:
yea,
let
them
exceedingly
rejoice.
068:004
Sing
unto
God,
sing
praises
to
his
name:
extol
him
that
rideth
upon
the
heavens
by
his
name
JAH,
and
rejoice
before
him.
068:005
A
father
of
the
fatherless,
and
a
judge
of
the
widows,
is
God
in
his
holy
habitation.
068:006
God
setteth
the
solitary
in
families:
he
bringeth
out
those
which
are
bound
with
chains:
but
the
rebellious
dwell
in
a
dry
land.
068:007
O
God,
when
thou
wentest
forth
before
thy
people,
when
thou
didst
march
through
the
wilderness;
Selah:
068:008
The
earth
shook,
the
heavens
also
dropped
at
the
presence
of
God:
even
Sinai
itself
was
moved
at
the
presence
of
God,
the
God
of
Israel.
068:009
Thou,
O
God,
didst
send
a
plentiful
rain,
whereby
thou
didst
confirm
thine
inheritance,
when
it
was
weary.
068:010
Thy
congregation
hath
dwelt
therein:
thou,
O
God,
hast
prepared
of
thy
goodness
for
the
poor.
068:011
The
Lord
gave
the
word:
great
was
the
company
of
those
that
published
it.
068:012
Kings
of
armies
did
flee
apace:
and
she
that
tarried
at
home
divided
the
spoil.
068:013
Though
ye
have
lien
among
the
pots,
yet
shall
ye
be
as
the
wings
of
a
dove
covered
with
silver,
and
her
feathers
with
yellow
gold.
068:014
When
the
Almighty
scattered
kings
in
it,
it
was
white
as
snow
in
Salmon.
068:015
The
hill
of
God
is
as
the
hill
of
Bashan;
an
high
hill
as
the
hill
of
Bashan.
068:016
Why
leap
ye,
ye
high
hills?
this
is
the
hill
which
God
desireth
to
dwell
in;
yea,
the
LORD
will
dwell
in
it
for
ever.
068:017
The
chariots
of
God
are
twenty
thousand,
even
thousands
of
angels:
the
Lord
is
among
them,
as
in
Sinai,
in
the
holy
place.
068:018
Thou
hast
ascended
on
high,
thou
hast
led
captivity
captive:
thou
hast
received
gifts
for
men;
yea,
for
the
rebellious
also,
that
the
LORD
God
might
dwell
among
them.
068:019
Blessed
be
the
Lord,
who
daily
loadeth
us
with
benefits,
even
the
God
of
our
salvation.
Selah.
068:020
He
that
is
our
God
is
the
God
of
salvation;
and
unto
GOD
the
Lord
belong
the
issues
from
death.
068:021
But
God
shall
wound
the
head
of
his
enemies,
and
the
hairy
scalp
of
such
an
one
as
goeth
on
still
in
his
trespasses.
068:022
The
Lord
said,
I
will
bring
again
from
Bashan,
I
will
bring
my
people
again
from
the
depths
of
the
sea:
068:023
That
thy
foot
may
be
dipped
in
the
blood
of
thine
enemies,
and
the
tongue
of
thy
dogs
in
the
same.
068:024
They
have
seen
thy
goings,
O
God;
even
the
goings
of
my
God,
my
King,
in
the
sanctuary.
068:025
The
singers
went
before,
the
players
on
instruments
followed
after;
among
them
were
the
damsels
playing
with
timbrels.
068:026
Bless
ye
God
in
the
congregations,
even
the
Lord,
from
the
fountain
of
Israel.
068:027
There
is
little
Benjamin
with
their
ruler,
the
princes
of
Judah
and
their
council,
the
princes
of
Zebulun,
and
the
princes
of
Naphtali.
068:028
Thy
God
hath
commanded
thy
strength:
strengthen,
O
God,
that
which
thou
hast
wrought
for
us.
068:029
Because
of
thy
temple
at
Jerusalem
shall
kings
bring
presents
unto
thee.
068:030
Rebuke
the
company
of
spearmen,
the
multitude
of
the
bulls,
with
the
calves
of
the
people,
till
every
one
submit
himself
with
pieces
of
silver:
scatter
thou
the
people
that
delight
in
war.
068:031
Princes
shall
come
out
of
Egypt;
Ethiopia
shall
soon
stretch
out
her
hands
unto
God.
068:032
Sing
unto
God,
ye
kingdoms
of
the
earth;
O
sing
praises
unto
the
Lord;
Selah:
068:033
To
him
that
rideth
upon
the
heavens
of
heavens,
which
were
of
old;
lo,
he
doth
send
out
his
voice,
and
that
a
mighty
voice.
068:034
Ascribe
ye
strength
unto
God:
his
excellency
is
over
Israel,
and
his
strength
is
in
the
clouds.
068:035
O
God,
thou
art
terrible
out
of
thy
holy
places:
the
God
of
Israel
is
he
that
giveth
strength
and
power
unto
his
people.
Blessed
be
God.
069:001
Save
me,
O
God;
for
the
waters
are
come
in
unto
my
soul.
069:002
I
sink
in
deep
mire,
where
there
is
no
standing:
I
am
come
into
deep
waters,
where
the
floods
overflow
me.
069:003
I
am
weary
of
my
crying:
my
throat
is
dried:
mine
eyes
fail
while
I
wait
for
my
God.
069:004
They
that
hate
me
without
a
cause
are
more
than
the
hairs
of
mine
head:
they
that
would
destroy
me,
being
mine
enemies
wrongfully,
are
mighty:
then
I
restored
that
which
I
took
not
away.
069:005
O
God,
thou
knowest
my
foolishness;
and
my
sins
are
not
hid
from
thee.
069:006
Let
not
them
that
wait
on
thee,
O
Lord
GOD
of
hosts,
be
ashamed
for
my
sake:
let
not
those
that
seek
thee
be
confounded
for
my
sake,
O
God
of
Israel.
069:007
Because
for
thy
sake
I
have
borne
reproach;
shame
hath
covered
my
face.
069:008
I
am
become
a
stranger
unto
my
brethren,
and
an
alien
unto
my
mother's
children.
069:009
For
the
zeal
of
thine
house
hath
eaten
me
up;
and
the
reproaches
of
them
that
reproached
thee
are
fallen
upon
me.
069:010
When
I
wept,
and
chastened
my
soul
with
fasting,
that
was
to
my
reproach.
069:011
I
made
sackcloth
also
my
garment;
and
I
became
a
proverb
to
them.
069:012
They
that
sit
in
the
gate
speak
against
me;
and
I
was
the
song
of
the
drunkards.
069:013
But
as
for
me,
my
prayer
is
unto
thee,
O
LORD,
in
an
acceptable
time:
O
God,
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mercy
hear
me,
in
the
truth
of
thy
salvation.
069:014
Deliver
me
out
of
the
mire,
and
let
me
not
sink:
let
me
be
delivered
from
them
that
hate
me,
and
out
of
the
deep
waters.
069:015
Let
not
the
waterflood
overflow
me,
neither
let
the
deep
swallow
me
up,
and
let
not
the
pit
shut
her
mouth
upon
me.
069:016
Hear
me,
O
LORD;
for
thy
lovingkindness
is
good:
turn
unto
me
according
to
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies.
069:017
And
hide
not
thy
face
from
thy
servant;
for
I
am
in
trouble:
hear
me
speedily.
069:018
Draw
nigh
unto
my
soul,
and
redeem
it:
deliver
me
because
of
mine
enemies.
069:019
Thou
hast
known
my
reproach,
and
my
shame,
and
my
dishonour:
mine
adversaries
are
all
before
thee.
069:020
Reproach
hath
broken
my
heart;
and
I
am
full
of
heaviness:
and
I
looked
for
some
to
take
pity,
but
there
was
none;
and
for
comforters,
but
I
found
none.
069:021
They
gave
me
also
gall
for
my
meat;
and
in
my
thirst
they
gave
me
vinegar
to
drink.
069:022
Let
their
table
become
a
snare
before
them:
and
that
which
should
have
been
for
their
welfare,
let
it
become
a
trap.
069:023
Let
their
eyes
be
darkened,
that
they
see
not;
and
make
their
loins
continually
to
shake.
069:024
Pour
out
thine
indignation
upon
them,
and
let
thy
wrathful
anger
take
hold
of
them.
069:025
Let
their
habitation
be
desolate;
and
let
none
dwell
in
their
tents.
069:026
For
they
persecute
him
whom
thou
hast
smitten;
and
they
talk
to
the
grief
of
those
whom
thou
hast
wounded.
069:027
Add
iniquity
unto
their
iniquity:
and
let
them
not
come
into
thy
righteousness.
069:028
Let
them
be
blotted
out
of
the
book
of
the
living,
and
not
be
written
with
the
righteous.
069:029
But
I
am
poor
and
sorrowful:
let
thy
salvation,
O
God,
set
me
up
on
high.
069:030
I
will
praise
the
name
of
God
with
a
song,
and
will
magnify
him
with
thanksgiving.
069:031
This
also
shall
please
the
LORD
better
than
an
ox
or
bullock
that
hath
horns
and
hoofs.
069:032
The
humble
shall
see
this,
and
be
glad:
and
your
heart
shall
live
that
seek
God.
069:033
For
the
LORD
heareth
the
poor,
and
despiseth
not
his
prisoners.
069:034
Let
the
heaven
and
earth
praise
him,
the
seas,
and
every
thing
that
moveth
therein.
069:035
For
God
will
save
Zion,
and
will
build
the
cities
of
Judah:
that
they
may
dwell
there,
and
have
it
in
possession.
069:036
The
seed
also
of
his
servants
shall
inherit
it:
and
they
that
love
his
name
shall
dwell
therein.
070:001
MAKE
HASTE,
O
GOD,
TO
DELIVER
ME;
MAKE
HASTE
TO
HELP
ME,
O
LORD.
070:002
Let
them
be
ashamed
and
confounded
that
seek
after
my
soul:
let
them
be
turned
backward,
and
put
to
confusion,
that
desire
my
hurt.
070:003
Let
them
be
turned
back
for
a
reward
of
their
shame
that
say,
Aha,
aha.
070:004
Let
all
those
that
seek
thee
rejoice
and
be
glad
in
thee:
and
let
such
as
love
thy
salvation
say
continually,
Let
God
be
magnified.
070:005
But
I
am
poor
and
needy:
make
haste
unto
me,
O
God:
thou
art
my
help
and
my
deliverer;
O
LORD,
make
no
tarrying.
071:001
In
thee,
O
LORD,
do
I
put
my
trust:
let
me
never
be
put
to
confusion.
071:002
Deliver
me
in
thy
righteousness,
and
cause
me
to
escape:
incline
thine
ear
unto
me,
and
save
me.
071:003
Be
thou
my
strong
habitation,
whereunto
I
may
continually
resort:
thou
hast
given
commandment
to
save
me;
for
thou
art
my
rock
and
my
fortress.
071:004
Deliver
me,
O
my
God,
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked,
out
of
the
hand
of
the
unrighteous
and
cruel
man.
071:005
For
thou
art
my
hope,
O
Lord
GOD:
thou
art
my
trust
from
my
youth.
071:006
By
thee
have
I
been
holden
up
from
the
womb:
thou
art
he
that
took
me
out
of
my
mother's
bowels:
my
praise
shall
be
continually
of
thee.
071:007
I
am
as
a
wonder
unto
many;
but
thou
art
my
strong
refuge.
071:008
Let
my
mouth
be
filled
with
thy
praise
and
with
thy
honour
all
the
day.
071:009
Cast
me
not
off
in
the
time
of
old
age;
forsake
me
not
when
my
strength
faileth.
071:010
For
mine
enemies
speak
against
me;
and
they
that
lay
wait
for
my
soul
take
counsel
together,
071:011
Saying,
God
hath
forsaken
him:
persecute
and
take
him;
for
there
is
none
to
deliver
him.
071:012
O
God,
be
not
far
from
me:
O
my
God,
make
haste
for
my
help.
071:013
Let
them
be
confounded
and
