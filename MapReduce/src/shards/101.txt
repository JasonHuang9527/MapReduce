consumed
that
are
adversaries
to
my
soul;
let
them
be
covered
with
reproach
and
dishonour
that
seek
my
hurt.
071:014
But
I
will
hope
continually,
and
will
yet
praise
thee
more
and
more.
071:015
My
mouth
shall
shew
forth
thy
righteousness
and
thy
salvation
all
the
day;
for
I
know
not
the
numbers
thereof.
071:016
I
will
go
in
the
strength
of
the
Lord
GOD:
I
will
make
mention
of
thy
righteousness,
even
of
thine
only.
071:017
O
God,
thou
hast
taught
me
from
my
youth:
and
hitherto
have
I
declared
thy
wondrous
works.
071:018
Now
also
when
I
am
old
and
greyheaded,
O
God,
forsake
me
not;
until
I
have
shewed
thy
strength
unto
this
generation,
and
thy
power
to
every
one
that
is
to
come.
071:019
Thy
righteousness
also,
O
God,
is
very
high,
who
hast
done
great
things:
O
God,
who
is
like
unto
thee!
071:020
Thou,
which
hast
shewed
me
great
and
sore
troubles,
shalt
quicken
me
again,
and
shalt
bring
me
up
again
from
the
depths
of
the
earth.
071:021
Thou
shalt
increase
my
greatness,
and
comfort
me
on
every
side.
071:022
I
will
also
praise
thee
with
the
psaltery,
even
thy
truth,
O
my
God:
unto
thee
will
I
sing
with
the
harp,
O
thou
Holy
One
of
Israel.
071:023
My
lips
shall
greatly
rejoice
when
I
sing
unto
thee;
and
my
soul,
which
thou
hast
redeemed.
071:024
My
tongue
also
shall
talk
of
thy
righteousness
all
the
day
long:
for
they
are
confounded,
for
they
are
brought
unto
shame,
that
seek
my
hurt.
072:001
Give
the
king
thy
judgments,
O
God,
and
thy
righteousness
unto
the
king's
son.
072:002
He
shall
judge
thy
people
with
righteousness,
and
thy
poor
with
judgment.
072:003
The
mountains
shall
bring
peace
to
the
people,
and
the
little
hills,
by
righteousness.
072:004
He
shall
judge
the
poor
of
the
people,
he
shall
save
the
children
of
the
needy,
and
shall
break
in
pieces
the
oppressor.
072:005
They
shall
fear
thee
as
long
as
the
sun
and
moon
endure,
throughout
all
generations.
072:006
He
shall
come
down
like
rain
upon
the
mown
grass:
as
showers
that
water
the
earth.
072:007
In
his
days
shall
the
righteous
flourish;
and
abundance
of
peace
so
long
as
the
moon
endureth.
072:008
He
shall
have
dominion
also
from
sea
to
sea,
and
from
the
river
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth.
072:009
They
that
dwell
in
the
wilderness
shall
bow
before
him;
and
his
enemies
shall
lick
the
dust.
072:010
The
kings
of
Tarshish
and
of
the
isles
shall
bring
presents:
the
kings
of
Sheba
and
Seba
shall
offer
gifts.
072:011
Yea,
all
kings
shall
fall
down
before
him:
all
nations
shall
serve
him.
072:012
For
he
shall
deliver
the
needy
when
he
crieth;
the
poor
also,
and
him
that
hath
no
helper.
072:013
He
shall
spare
the
poor
and
needy,
and
shall
save
the
souls
of
the
needy.
072:014
He
shall
redeem
their
soul
from
deceit
and
violence:
and
precious
shall
their
blood
be
in
his
sight.
072:015
And
he
shall
live,
and
to
him
shall
be
given
of
the
gold
of
Sheba:
prayer
also
shall
be
made
for
him
continually;
and
daily
shall
he
be
praised.
072:016
There
shall
be
an
handful
of
corn
in
the
earth
upon
the
top
of
the
mountains;
the
fruit
thereof
shall
shake
like
Lebanon:
and
they
of
the
city
shall
flourish
like
grass
of
the
earth.
072:017
His
name
shall
endure
for
ever:
his
name
shall
be
continued
as
long
as
the
sun:
and
men
shall
be
blessed
in
him:
all
nations
shall
call
him
blessed.
072:018
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God,
the
God
of
Israel,
who
only
doeth
wondrous
things.
072:019
And
blessed
be
his
glorious
name
for
ever:
and
let
the
whole
earth
be
filled
with
his
glory;
Amen,
and
Amen.
072:020
The
prayers
of
David
the
son
of
Jesse
are
ended.
073:001
Truly
God
is
good
to
Israel,
even
to
such
as
are
of
a
clean
heart.
073:002
But
as
for
me,
my
feet
were
almost
gone;
my
steps
had
well
nigh
slipped.
073:003
For
I
was
envious
at
the
foolish,
when
I
saw
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked.
073:004
For
there
are
no
bands
in
their
death:
but
their
strength
is
firm.
073:005
They
are
not
in
trouble
as
other
men;
neither
are
they
plagued
like
other
men.
073:006
Therefore
pride
compasseth
them
about
as
a
chain;
violence
covereth
them
as
a
garment.
073:007
Their
eyes
stand
out
with
fatness:
they
have
more
than
heart
could
wish.
073:008
They
are
corrupt,
and
speak
wickedly
concerning
oppression:
they
speak
loftily.
073:009
They
set
their
mouth
against
the
heavens,
and
their
tongue
walketh
through
the
earth.
073:010
Therefore
his
people
return
hither:
and
waters
of
a
full
cup
are
wrung
out
to
them.
073:011
And
they
say,
How
doth
God
know?
and
is
there
knowledge
in
the
most
High?
073:012
Behold,
these
are
the
ungodly,
who
prosper
in
the
world;
they
increase
in
riches.
073:013
Verily
I
have
cleansed
my
heart
in
vain,
and
washed
my
hands
in
innocency.
073:014
For
all
the
day
long
have
I
been
plagued,
and
chastened
every
morning.
073:015
If
I
say,
I
will
speak
thus;
behold,
I
should
offend
against
the
generation
of
thy
children.
073:016
When
I
thought
to
know
this,
it
was
too
painful
for
me;
073:017
Until
I
went
into
the
sanctuary
of
God;
then
understood
I
their
end.
073:018
Surely
thou
didst
set
them
in
slippery
places:
thou
castedst
them
down
into
destruction.
073:019
How
are
they
brought
into
desolation,
as
in
a
moment!
they
are
utterly
consumed
with
terrors.
073:020
As
a
dream
when
one
awaketh;
so,
O
Lord,
when
thou
awakest,
thou
shalt
despise
their
image.
073:021
Thus
my
heart
was
grieved,
and
I
was
pricked
in
my
reins.
073:022
So
foolish
was
I,
and
ignorant:
I
was
as
a
beast
before
thee.
073:023
Nevertheless
I
am
continually
with
thee:
thou
hast
holden
me
by
my
right
hand.
073:024
Thou
shalt
guide
me
with
thy
counsel,
and
afterward
receive
me
to
glory.
073:025
Whom
have
I
in
heaven
but
thee?
and
there
is
none
upon
earth
that
I
desire
beside
thee.
073:026
My
flesh
and
my
heart
faileth:
but
God
is
the
strength
of
my
heart,
and
my
portion
for
ever.
073:027
For,
lo,
they
that
are
far
from
thee
shall
perish:
thou
hast
destroyed
all
them
that
go
a
whoring
from
thee.
073:028
But
it
is
good
for
me
to
draw
near
to
God:
I
have
put
my
trust
in
the
Lord
GOD,
that
I
may
declare
all
thy
works.
074:001
O
God,
why
hast
thou
cast
us
off
for
ever?
why
doth
thine
anger
smoke
against
the
sheep
of
thy
pasture?
074:002
Remember
thy
congregation,
which
thou
hast
purchased
of
old;
the
rod
of
thine
inheritance,
which
thou
hast
redeemed;
this
mount
Zion,
wherein
thou
hast
dwelt.
074:003
Lift
up
thy
feet
unto
the
perpetual
desolations;
even
all
that
the
enemy
hath
done
wickedly
in
the
sanctuary.
074:004
Thine
enemies
roar
in
the
midst
of
thy
congregations;
they
set
up
their
ensigns
for
signs.
074:005
A
man
was
famous
according
as
he
had
lifted
up
axes
upon
the
thick
trees.
074:006
But
now
they
break
down
the
carved
work
thereof
at
once
with
axes
and
hammers.
074:007
They
have
cast
fire
into
thy
sanctuary,
they
have
defiled
by
casting
down
the
dwelling
place
of
thy
name
to
the
ground.
074:008
They
said
in
their
hearts,
Let
us
destroy
them
together:
they
have
burned
up
all
the
synagogues
of
God
in
the
land.
074:009
We
see
not
our
signs:
there
is
no
more
any
prophet:
neither
is
there
among
us
any
that
knoweth
how
long.
074:010
O
God,
how
long
shall
the
adversary
reproach?
shall
the
enemy
blaspheme
thy
name
for
ever?
074:011
Why
withdrawest
thou
thy
hand,
even
thy
right
hand?
pluck
it
out
of
thy
bosom.
074:012
For
God
is
my
King
of
old,
working
salvation
in
the
midst
of
the
earth.
074:013
Thou
didst
divide
the
sea
by
thy
strength:
thou
brakest
the
heads
of
the
dragons
in
the
waters.
074:014
Thou
brakest
the
heads
of
leviathan
in
pieces,
and
gavest
him
to
be
meat
to
the
people
inhabiting
the
wilderness.
074:015
Thou
didst
cleave
the
fountain
and
the
flood:
thou
driedst
up
mighty
rivers.
074:016
The
day
is
thine,
the
night
also
is
thine:
thou
hast
prepared
the
light
and
the
sun.
074:017
Thou
hast
set
all
the
borders
of
the
earth:
thou
hast
made
summer
and
winter.
074:018
Remember
this,
that
the
enemy
hath
reproached,
O
LORD,
and
that
the
foolish
people
have
blasphemed
thy
name.
074:019
O
deliver
not
the
soul
of
thy
turtledove
unto
the
multitude
of
the
wicked:
forget
not
the
congregation
of
thy
poor
for
ever.
074:020
Have
respect
unto
the
covenant:
for
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
are
full
of
the
habitations
of
cruelty.
074:021
O
let
not
the
oppressed
return
ashamed:
let
the
poor
and
needy
praise
thy
name.
074:022
Arise,
O
God,
plead
thine
own
cause:
remember
how
the
foolish
man
reproacheth
thee
daily.
074:023
Forget
not
the
voice
of
thine
enemies:
the
tumult
of
those
that
rise
up
against
thee
increaseth
continually.
075:001
Unto
thee,
O
God,
do
we
give
thanks,
unto
thee
do
we
give
thanks:
for
that
thy
name
is
near
thy
wondrous
works
declare.
075:002
When
I
shall
receive
the
congregation
I
will
judge
uprightly.
075:003
The
earth
and
all
the
inhabitants
thereof
are
dissolved:
I
bear
up
the
pillars
of
it.
Selah.
075:004
I
said
unto
the
fools,
Deal
not
foolishly:
and
to
the
wicked,
Lift
not
up
the
horn:
075:005
Lift
not
up
your
horn
on
high:
speak
not
with
a
stiff
neck.
075:006
For
promotion
cometh
neither
from
the
east,
nor
from
the
west,
nor
from
the
south.
075:007
But
God
is
the
judge:
he
putteth
down
one,
and
setteth
up
another.
075:008
For
in
the
hand
of
the
LORD
there
is
a
cup,
and
the
wine
is
red;
it
is
full
of
mixture;
and
he
poureth
out
of
the
same:
but
the
dregs
thereof,
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
shall
wring
them
out,
and
drink
them.
075:009
But
I
will
declare
for
ever;
I
will
sing
praises
to
the
God
of
Jacob.
075:010
All
the
horns
of
the
wicked
also
will
I
cut
off;
but
the
horns
of
the
righteous
shall
be
exalted.
076:001
In
Judah
is
God
known:
his
name
is
great
in
Israel.
076:002
In
Salem
also
is
his
tabernacle,
and
his
dwelling
place
in
Zion.
076:003
There
brake
he
the
arrows
of
the
bow,
the
shield,
and
the
sword,
and
the
battle.
Selah.
076:004
Thou
art
more
glorious
and
excellent
than
the
mountains
of
prey.
076:005
The
stouthearted
are
spoiled,
they
have
slept
their
sleep:
and
none
of
the
men
of
might
have
found
their
hands.
076:006
At
thy
rebuke,
O
God
of
Jacob,
both
the
chariot
and
horse
are
cast
into
a
dead
sleep.
076:007
Thou,
even
thou,
art
to
be
feared:
and
who
may
stand
in
thy
sight
when
once
thou
art
angry?
076:008
Thou
didst
cause
judgment
to
be
heard
from
heaven;
the
earth
feared,
and
was
still,
076:009
When
God
arose
to
judgment,
to
save
all
the
meek
of
the
earth.
Selah.
076:010
Surely
the
wrath
of
man
shall
praise
thee:
the
remainder
of
wrath
shalt
thou
restrain.
076:011
Vow,
and
pay
unto
the
LORD
your
God:
let
all
that
be
round
about
him
bring
presents
unto
him
that
ought
to
be
feared.
076:012
He
shall
cut
off
the
spirit
of
princes:
he
is
terrible
to
the
kings
of
the
earth.
077:001
I
cried
unto
God
with
my
voice,
even
unto
God
with
my
voice;
and
he
gave
ear
unto
me.
077:002
In
the
day
of
my
trouble
I
sought
the
Lord:
my
sore
ran
in
the
night,
and
ceased
not:
my
soul
refused
to
be
comforted.
077:003
I
remembered
God,
and
was
troubled:
I
complained,
and
my
spirit
was
overwhelmed.
Selah.
077:004
Thou
holdest
mine
eyes
waking:
I
am
so
troubled
that
I
cannot
speak.
077:005
I
have
considered
the
days
of
old,
the
years
of
ancient
times.
077:006
I
call
to
remembrance
my
song
in
the
night:
I
commune
with
mine
own
heart:
and
my
spirit
made
diligent
search.
077:007
Will
the
Lord
cast
off
for
ever?
and
will
he
be
favourable
no
more?
077:008
Is
his
mercy
clean
gone
for
ever?
doth
his
promise
fail
for
evermore?
077:009
Hath
God
forgotten
to
be
gracious?
hath
he
in
anger
shut
up
his
tender
mercies?
Selah.
077:010
And
I
said,
This
is
my
infirmity:
but
I
will
remember
the
years
of
the
right
hand
of
the
most
High.
077:011
I
will
remember
the
works
of
the
LORD:
surely
I
will
remember
thy
wonders
of
old.
077:012
I
will
meditate
also
of
all
thy
work,
and
talk
of
thy
doings.
077:013
Thy
way,
O
God,
is
in
the
sanctuary:
who
is
so
great
a
God
as
our
God?
077:014
Thou
art
the
God
that
doest
wonders:
thou
hast
declared
thy
strength
among
the
people.
077:015
Thou
hast
with
thine
arm
redeemed
thy
people,
the
sons
of
Jacob
and
Joseph.
Selah.
077:016
The
waters
saw
thee,
O
God,
the
waters
saw
thee;
they
were
afraid:
the
depths
also
were
troubled.
077:017
The
clouds
poured
out
water:
the
skies
sent
out
a
sound:
thine
arrows
also
went
abroad.
077:018
The
voice
of
thy
thunder
was
in
the
heaven:
the
lightnings
lightened
the
world:
the
earth
trembled
and
shook.
077:019
Thy
way
is
in
the
sea,
and
thy
path
in
the
great
waters,
and
thy
footsteps
are
not
known.
077:020
Thou
leddest
thy
people
like
a
flock
by
the
hand
of
Moses
and
Aaron.
078:001
Give
ear,
O
my
people,
to
my
law:
incline
your
ears
to
the
words
of
my
mouth.
078:002
I
will
open
my
mouth
in
a
parable:
I
will
utter
dark
sayings
of
old:
078:003
Which
we
have
heard
and
known,
and
our
fathers
have
told
us.
078:004
We
will
not
hide
them
from
their
children,
shewing
to
the
generation
to
come
the
praises
of
the
LORD,
and
his
strength,
and
his
wonderful
works
that
he
hath
done.
078:005
For
he
established
a
testimony
in
Jacob,
and
appointed
a
law
in
Israel,
which
he
commanded
our
fathers,
that
they
should
make
them
known
to
their
children:
078:006
That
the
generation
to
come
might
know
them,
even
the
children
which
should
be
born;
who
should
arise
and
declare
them
to
their
children:
078:007
That
they
might
set
their
hope
in
God,
and
not
forget
the
works
of
God,
but
keep
his
commandments:
078:008
And
might
not
be
as
their
fathers,
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
generation;
a
generation
that
set
not
their
heart
aright,
and
whose
spirit
was
not
stedfast
with
God.
078:009
The
children
of
Ephraim,
being
armed,
and
carrying
bows,
turned
back
in
the
day
of
battle.
078:010
They
kept
not
the
covenant
of
God,
and
refused
to
walk
in
his
law;
078:011
And
forgat
his
works,
and
his
wonders
that
he
had
shewed
them.
078:012
Marvellous
things
did
he
in
the
sight
of
their
fathers,
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
in
the
field
of
Zoan.
078:013
He
divided
the
sea,
and
caused
them
to
pass
through;
and
he
made
the
waters
to
stand
as
an
heap.
078:014
In
the
daytime
also
he
led
them
with
a
cloud,
and
all
the
night
with
a
light
of
fire.
078:015
He
clave
the
rocks
in
the
wilderness,
and
gave
them
drink
as
out
of
the
great
depths.
078:016
He
brought
streams
also
out
of
the
rock,
and
caused
waters
to
run
down
like
rivers.
078:017
And
they
sinned
yet
more
against
him
by
provoking
the
most
High
in
the
wilderness.
078:018
And
they
tempted
God
in
their
heart
by
asking
meat
for
their
lust.
078:019
Yea,
they
spake
against
God;
they
said,
Can
God
furnish
a
table
in
the
wilderness?
078:020
Behold,
he
smote
the
rock,
that
the
waters
gushed
out,
and
the
streams
overflowed;
can
he
give
bread
also?
can
he
provide
flesh
for
his
people?
078:021
Therefore
the
LORD
heard
this,
and
was
wroth:
so
a
fire
was
kindled
against
Jacob,
and
anger
also
came
up
against
Israel;
078:022
Because
they
believed
not
in
God,
and
trusted
not
in
his
salvation:
078:023
Though
he
had
commanded
the
clouds
from
above,
and
opened
the
doors
of
heaven,
078:024
And
had
rained
down
manna
upon
them
to
eat,
and
had
given
them
of
the
corn
of
heaven.
078:025
Man
did
eat
angels'
food:
he
sent
them
meat
to
the
full.
078:026
He
caused
an
east
wind
to
blow
in
the
heaven:
and
by
his
power
he
brought
in
the
south
wind.
078:027
He
rained
flesh
also
upon
them
as
dust,
and
feathered
fowls
like
as
the
sand
of
the
sea:
078:028
And
he
let
it
fall
in
the
midst
of
their
camp,
round
about
their
habitations.
078:029
So
they
did
eat,
and
were
well
filled:
for
he
gave
them
their
own
desire;
078:030
They
were
not
estranged
from
their
lust.
But
while
their
meat
was
yet
in
their
mouths,
078:031
The
wrath
of
God
came
upon
them,
and
slew
the
fattest
of
them,
and
smote
down
the
chosen
men
of
Israel.
078:032
For
all
this
they
sinned
still,
and
believed
not
for
his
wondrous
works.
078:033
Therefore
their
days
did
he
consume
in
vanity,
and
their
years
in
trouble.
078:034
When
he
slew
them,
then
they
sought
him:
and
they
returned
and
enquired
early
after
God.
078:035
And
they
remembered
that
God
was
their
rock,
and
the
high
God
their
redeemer.
078:036
Nevertheless
they
did
flatter
him
with
their
mouth,
and
they
lied
unto
him
with
their
tongues.
078:037
For
their
heart
was
not
right
with
him,
neither
were
they
stedfast
in
his
covenant.
078:038
But
he,
being
full
of
compassion,
forgave
their
iniquity,
and
destroyed
them
not:
yea,
many
a
time
turned
he
his
anger
away,
and
did
not
stir
up
all
his
wrath.
078:039
For
he
remembered
that
they
were
but
flesh;
a
wind
that
passeth
away,
and
cometh
not
again.
078:040
How
oft
did
they
provoke
him
in
the
wilderness,
and
grieve
him
in
the
desert!
078:041
Yea,
they
turned
back
and
tempted
God,
and
limited
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
078:042
They
remembered
not
his
hand,
nor
the
day
when
he
delivered
them
from
the
enemy.
078:043
How
he
had
wrought
his
signs
in
Egypt,
and
his
wonders
in
the
field
of
Zoan.
078:044
And
had
turned
their
rivers
into
blood;
and
their
floods,
that
they
could
not
drink.
078:045
He
sent
divers
sorts
of
flies
among
them,
which
devoured
them;
and
frogs,
which
destroyed
them.
078:046
He
gave
also
their
increase
unto
the
caterpiller,
and
their
labour
unto
the
locust.
078:047
He
destroyed
their
vines
with
hail,
and
their
sycomore
trees
with
frost.
078:048
He
gave
up
their
cattle
also
to
the
hail,
and
their
flocks
to
hot
thunderbolts.
078:049
He
cast
upon
them
the
fierceness
of
his
anger,
wrath,
and
indignation,
and
trouble,
by
sending
evil
angels
among
them.
078:050
He
made
a
way
to
his
anger;
he
spared
not
their
soul
from
death,
but
gave
their
life
over
to
the
pestilence;
078:051
And
smote
all
the
firstborn
in
Egypt;
the
chief
of
their
strength
in
the
tabernacles
of
Ham:
078:052
But
made
his
own
people
to
go
forth
like
sheep,
and
guided
them
in
the
wilderness
like
a
flock.
078:053
And
he
led
them
on
safely,
so
that
they
feared
not:
but
the
sea
overwhelmed
their
enemies.
078:054
And
he
brought
them
to
the
border
of
his
sanctuary,
even
to
this
mountain,
which
his
right
hand
had
purchased.
078:055
He
cast
out
the
heathen
also
before
them,
and
divided
them
an
inheritance
by
line,
and
made
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
dwell
in
their
tents.
078:056
Yet
they
tempted
and
provoked
the
most
high
God,
and
kept
not
his
testimonies:
078:057
But
turned
back,
and
dealt
unfaithfully
like
their
fathers:
they
were
turned
aside
like
a
deceitful
bow.
078:058
For
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
high
places,
and
moved
him
to
jealousy
with
their
graven
images.
078:059
When
God
heard
this,
he
was
wroth,
and
greatly
abhorred
Israel:
078:060
So
that
he
forsook
the
tabernacle
of
Shiloh,
the
tent
which
he
placed
among
men;
078:061
And
delivered
his
strength
into
captivity,
and
his
glory
into
the
enemy's
hand.
078:062
He
gave
his
people
over
also
unto
the
sword;
and
was
wroth
with
his
inheritance.
078:063
The
fire
consumed
their
young
men;
and
their
maidens
were
not
given
to
marriage.
078:064
Their
priests
fell
by
the
sword;
and
their
widows
made
no
lamentation.
078:065
Then
the
LORD
awaked
as
one
out
of
sleep,
and
like
a
mighty
man
that
shouteth
by
reason
of
wine.
078:066
And
he
smote
his
enemies
in
the
hinder
parts:
he
put
them
to
a
perpetual
reproach.
078:067
Moreover
he
refused
the
tabernacle
of
Joseph,
and
chose
not
the
tribe
of
Ephraim:
078:068
But
chose
the
tribe
of
Judah,
the
mount
Zion
which
he
loved.
078:069
And
he
built
his
sanctuary
like
high
palaces,
like
the
earth
which
he
hath
established
for
ever.
078:070
He
chose
David
also
his
servant,
and
took
him
from
the
sheepfolds:
078:071
From
following
the
ewes
great
with
young
he
brought
him
to
feed
Jacob
his
people,
and
Israel
his
inheritance.
078:072
So
he
fed
them
according
to
the
integrity
of
his
heart;
and
guided
them
by
the
skilfulness
of
his
hands.
079:001
O
god,
the
heathen
are
come
into
thine
inheritance;
thy
holy
temple
have
they
defiled;
they
have
laid
Jerusalem
on
heaps.
079:002
The
dead
bodies
of
thy
servants
have
they
given
to
be
meat
unto
the
fowls
of
the
heaven,
the
flesh
of
thy
saints
unto
the
beasts
of
the
earth.
079:003
Their
blood
have
they
shed
like
water
round
about
Jerusalem;
and
there
was
none
to
bury
them.
079:004
We
are
become
a
reproach
to
our
neighbours,
a
scorn
and
derision
to
them
that
are
round
about
us.
079:005
How
long,
LORD?
wilt
thou
be
angry
for
ever?
shall
thy
jealousy
burn
like
fire?
079:006
Pour
out
thy
wrath
upon
the
heathen
that
have
not
known
thee,
and
upon
the
kingdoms
that
have
not
called
upon
thy
name.
079:007
For
they
have
devoured
Jacob,
and
laid
waste
his
dwelling
place.
079:008
O
remember
not
against
us
former
iniquities:
let
thy
tender
mercies
speedily
prevent
us:
for
we
are
brought
very
low.
079:009
Help
us,
O
God
of
our
salvation,
for
the
glory
of
thy
name:
and
deliver
us,
and
purge
away
our
sins,
for
thy
name's
sake.
079:010
Wherefore
should
the
heathen
say,
Where
is
their
God?
let
him
be
known
among
the
heathen
in
our
sight
by
the
revenging
of
the
blood
of
thy
servants
which
is
shed.
079:011
Let
the
sighing
of
the
prisoner
come
before
thee;
according
to
the
greatness
of
thy
power
preserve
thou
those
that
are
appointed
to
die;
079:012
And
render
unto
our
neighbours
sevenfold
into
their
bosom
their
reproach,
wherewith
they
have
reproached
thee,
O
Lord.
079:013
So
we
thy
people
and
sheep
of
thy
pasture
will
give
thee
thanks
for
ever:
we
will
shew
forth
thy
praise
to
all
generations.
080:001
Give
ear,
O
Shepherd
of
Israel,
thou
that
leadest
Joseph
like
a
flock;
thou
that
dwellest
between
the
cherubims,
shine
forth.
080:002
Before
Ephraim
and
Benjamin
and
Manasseh
stir
up
thy
strength,
and
come
and
save
us.
080:003
Turn
us
again,
O
God,
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine;
and
we
shall
be
saved.
080:004
O
LORD
God
of
hosts,
how
long
wilt
thou
be
angry
against
the
prayer
of
thy
people?
080:005
Thou
feedest
them
with
the
bread
of
tears;
and
givest
them
tears
to
drink
in
great
measure.
080:006
Thou
makest
us
a
strife
unto
our
neighbours:
and
our
enemies
laugh
among
themselves.
080:007
Turn
us
again,
O
God
of
hosts,
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine;
and
we
shall
be
saved.
080:008
Thou
hast
brought
a
vine
out
of
Egypt:
thou
hast
cast
out
the
heathen,
and
planted
it.
080:009
Thou
preparedst
room
before
it,
and
didst
cause
it
to
take
deep
root,
and
it
filled
the
land.
080:010
The
hills
were
covered
with
the
shadow
of
it,
and
the
boughs
thereof
were
like
the
goodly
cedars.
080:011
She
sent
out
her
boughs
unto
the
sea,
and
her
branches
unto
the
river.
080:012
Why
hast
thou
then
broken
down
her
hedges,
so
that
all
they
which
pass
by
the
way
do
pluck
her?
080:013
The
