boar
out
of
the
wood
doth
waste
it,
and
the
wild
beast
of
the
field
doth
devour
it.
080:014
Return,
we
beseech
thee,
O
God
of
hosts:
look
down
from
heaven,
and
behold,
and
visit
this
vine;
080:015
And
the
vineyard
which
thy
right
hand
hath
planted,
and
the
branch
that
thou
madest
strong
for
thyself.
080:016
It
is
burned
with
fire,
it
is
cut
down:
they
perish
at
the
rebuke
of
thy
countenance.
080:017
Let
thy
hand
be
upon
the
man
of
thy
right
hand,
upon
the
son
of
man
whom
thou
madest
strong
for
thyself.
080:018
So
will
not
we
go
back
from
thee:
quicken
us,
and
we
will
call
upon
thy
name.
080:019
Turn
us
again,
O
LORD
God
of
hosts,
cause
thy
face
to
shine;
and
we
shall
be
saved.
081:001
Sing
aloud
unto
God
our
strength:
make
a
joyful
noise
unto
the
God
of
Jacob.
081:002
Take
a
psalm,
and
bring
hither
the
timbrel,
the
pleasant
harp
with
the
psaltery.
081:003
Blow
up
the
trumpet
in
the
new
moon,
in
the
time
appointed,
on
our
solemn
feast
day.
081:004
For
this
was
a
statute
for
Israel,
and
a
law
of
the
God
of
Jacob.
081:005
This
he
ordained
in
Joseph
for
a
testimony,
when
he
went
out
through
the
land
of
Egypt:
where
I
heard
a
language
that
I
understood
not.
081:006
I
removed
his
shoulder
from
the
burden:
his
hands
were
delivered
from
the
pots.
081:007
Thou
calledst
in
trouble,
and
I
delivered
thee;
I
answered
thee
in
the
secret
place
of
thunder:
I
proved
thee
at
the
waters
of
Meribah.
Selah.
081:008
Hear,
O
my
people,
and
I
will
testify
unto
thee:
O
Israel,
if
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
me;
081:009
There
shall
no
strange
god
be
in
thee;
neither
shalt
thou
worship
any
strange
god.
081:010
I
am
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt:
open
thy
mouth
wide,
and
I
will
fill
it.
081:011
But
my
people
would
not
hearken
to
my
voice;
and
Israel
would
none
of
me.
081:012
So
I
gave
them
up
unto
their
own
hearts'
lust:
and
they
walked
in
their
own
counsels.
081:013
Oh
that
my
people
had
hearkened
unto
me,
and
Israel
had
walked
in
my
ways!
081:014
I
should
soon
have
subdued
their
enemies,
and
turned
my
hand
against
their
adversaries.
081:015
The
haters
of
the
LORD
should
have
submitted
themselves
unto
him:
but
their
time
should
have
endured
for
ever.
081:016
He
should
have
fed
them
also
with
the
finest
of
the
wheat:
and
with
honey
out
of
the
rock
should
I
have
satisfied
thee.
082:001
God
standeth
in
the
congregation
of
the
mighty;
he
judgeth
among
the
gods.
082:002
How
long
will
ye
judge
unjustly,
and
accept
the
persons
of
the
wicked?
Selah.
082:003
Defend
the
poor
and
fatherless:
do
justice
to
the
afflicted
and
needy.
082:004
Deliver
the
poor
and
needy:
rid
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked.
082:005
They
know
not,
neither
will
they
understand;
they
walk
on
in
darkness:
all
the
foundations
of
the
earth
are
out
of
course.
082:006
I
have
said,
Ye
are
gods;
and
all
of
you
are
children
of
the
most
High.
082:007
But
ye
shall
die
like
men,
and
fall
like
one
of
the
princes.
082:008
Arise,
O
God,
judge
the
earth:
for
thou
shalt
inherit
all
nations.
083:001
Keep
not
thou
silence,
O
God:
hold
not
thy
peace,
and
be
not
still,
O
God.
083:002
For,
lo,
thine
enemies
make
a
tumult:
and
they
that
hate
thee
have
lifted
up
the
head.
083:003
They
have
taken
crafty
counsel
against
thy
people,
and
consulted
against
thy
hidden
ones.
083:004
They
have
said,
Come,
and
let
us
cut
them
off
from
being
a
nation;
that
the
name
of
Israel
may
be
no
more
in
remembrance.
083:005
For
they
have
consulted
together
with
one
consent:
they
are
confederate
against
thee:
083:006
The
tabernacles
of
Edom,
and
the
Ishmaelites;
of
Moab,
and
the
Hagarenes;
083:007
Gebal,
and
Ammon,
and
Amalek;
the
Philistines
with
the
inhabitants
of
Tyre;
083:008
Assur
also
is
joined
with
them:
they
have
holpen
the
children
of
Lot.
Selah.
083:009
Do
unto
them
as
unto
the
Midianites;
as
to
Sisera,
as
to
Jabin,
at
the
brook
of
Kison:
083:010
Which
perished
at
Endor:
they
became
as
dung
for
the
earth.
083:011
Make
their
nobles
like
Oreb,
and
like
Zeeb:
yea,
all
their
princes
as
Zebah,
and
as
Zalmunna:
083:012
Who
said,
Let
us
take
to
ourselves
the
houses
of
God
in
possession.
083:013
O
my
God,
make
them
like
a
wheel;
as
the
stubble
before
the
wind.
083:014
As
the
fire
burneth
a
wood,
and
as
the
flame
setteth
the
mountains
on
fire;
083:015
So
persecute
them
with
thy
tempest,
and
make
them
afraid
with
thy
storm.
083:016
Fill
their
faces
with
shame;
that
they
may
seek
thy
name,
O
LORD.
083:017
Let
them
be
confounded
and
troubled
for
ever;
yea,
let
them
be
put
to
shame,
and
perish:
083:018
That
men
may
know
that
thou,
whose
name
alone
is
JEHOVAH,
art
the
most
high
over
all
the
earth.
084:001
How
amiable
are
thy
tabernacles,
O
LORD
of
hosts!
084:002
My
soul
longeth,
yea,
even
fainteth
for
the
courts
of
the
LORD:
my
heart
and
my
flesh
crieth
out
for
the
living
God.
084:003
Yea,
the
sparrow
hath
found
an
house,
and
the
swallow
a
nest
for
herself,
where
she
may
lay
her
young,
even
thine
altars,
O
LORD
of
hosts,
my
King,
and
my
God.
084:004
Blessed
are
they
that
dwell
in
thy
house:
they
will
be
still
praising
thee.
Selah.
084:005
Blessed
is
the
man
whose
strength
is
in
thee;
in
whose
heart
are
the
ways
of
them.
084:006
Who
passing
through
the
valley
of
Baca
make
it
a
well;
the
rain
also
filleth
the
pools.
084:007
They
go
from
strength
to
strength,
every
one
of
them
in
Zion
appeareth
before
God.
084:008
O
LORD
God
of
hosts,
hear
my
prayer:
give
ear,
O
God
of
Jacob.
Selah.
084:009
Behold,
O
God
our
shield,
and
look
upon
the
face
of
thine
anointed.
084:010
For
a
day
in
thy
courts
is
better
than
a
thousand.
I
had
rather
be
a
doorkeeper
in
the
house
of
my
God,
than
to
dwell
in
the
tents
of
wickedness.
084:011
For
the
LORD
God
is
a
sun
and
shield:
the
LORD
will
give
grace
and
glory:
no
good
thing
will
he
withhold
from
them
that
walk
uprightly.
084:012
O
LORD
of
hosts,
blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
thee.
085:001
Lord,
thou
hast
been
favourable
unto
thy
land:
thou
hast
brought
back
the
captivity
of
Jacob.
085:002
Thou
hast
forgiven
the
iniquity
of
thy
people,
thou
hast
covered
all
their
sin.
Selah.
085:003
Thou
hast
taken
away
all
thy
wrath:
thou
hast
turned
thyself
from
the
fierceness
of
thine
anger.
085:004
Turn
us,
O
God
of
our
salvation,
and
cause
thine
anger
toward
us
to
cease.
085:005
Wilt
thou
be
angry
with
us
for
ever?
wilt
thou
draw
out
thine
anger
to
all
generations?
085:006
Wilt
thou
not
revive
us
again:
that
thy
people
may
rejoice
in
thee?
085:007
Shew
us
thy
mercy,
O
LORD,
and
grant
us
thy
salvation.
085:008
I
will
hear
what
God
the
LORD
will
speak:
for
he
will
speak
peace
unto
his
people,
and
to
his
saints:
but
let
them
not
turn
again
to
folly.
085:009
Surely
his
salvation
is
nigh
them
that
fear
him;
that
glory
may
dwell
in
our
land.
085:010
Mercy
and
truth
are
met
together;
righteousness
and
peace
have
kissed
each
other.
085:011
Truth
shall
spring
out
of
the
earth;
and
righteousness
shall
look
down
from
heaven.
085:012
Yea,
the
LORD
shall
give
that
which
is
good;
and
our
land
shall
yield
her
increase.
085:013
Righteousness
shall
go
before
him;
and
shall
set
us
in
the
way
of
his
steps.
086:001
Bow
down
thine
ear,
O
LORD,
hear
me:
for
I
am
poor
and
needy.
086:002
Preserve
my
soul;
for
I
am
holy:
O
thou
my
God,
save
thy
servant
that
trusteth
in
thee.
086:003
Be
merciful
unto
me,
O
Lord:
for
I
cry
unto
thee
daily.
086:004
Rejoice
the
soul
of
thy
servant:
for
unto
thee,
O
Lord,
do
I
lift
up
my
soul.
086:005
For
thou,
Lord,
art
good,
and
ready
to
forgive;
and
plenteous
in
mercy
unto
all
them
that
call
upon
thee.
086:006
Give
ear,
O
LORD,
unto
my
prayer;
and
attend
to
the
voice
of
my
supplications.
086:007
In
the
day
of
my
trouble
I
will
call
upon
thee:
for
thou
wilt
answer
me.
086:008
Among
the
gods
there
is
none
like
unto
thee,
O
Lord;
neither
are
there
any
works
like
unto
thy
works.
086:009
All
nations
whom
thou
hast
made
shall
come
and
worship
before
thee,
O
Lord;
and
shall
glorify
thy
name.
086:010
For
thou
art
great,
and
doest
wondrous
things:
thou
art
God
alone.
086:011
Teach
me
thy
way,
O
LORD;
I
will
walk
in
thy
truth:
unite
my
heart
to
fear
thy
name.
086:012
I
will
praise
thee,
O
Lord
my
God,
with
all
my
heart:
and
I
will
glorify
thy
name
for
evermore.
086:013
For
great
is
thy
mercy
toward
me:
and
thou
hast
delivered
my
soul
from
the
lowest
hell.
086:014
O
God,
the
proud
are
risen
against
me,
and
the
assemblies
of
violent
men
have
sought
after
my
soul;
and
have
not
set
thee
before
them.
086:015
But
thou,
O
Lord,
art
a
God
full
of
compassion,
and
gracious,
longsuffering,
and
plenteous
in
mercy
and
truth.
086:016
O
turn
unto
me,
and
have
mercy
upon
me;
give
thy
strength
unto
thy
servant,
and
save
the
son
of
thine
handmaid.
086:017
Shew
me
a
token
for
good;
that
they
which
hate
me
may
see
it,
and
be
ashamed:
because
thou,
LORD,
hast
holpen
me,
and
comforted
me.
087:001
His
foundation
is
in
the
holy
mountains.
087:002
The
LORD
loveth
the
gates
of
Zion
more
than
all
the
dwellings
of
Jacob.
087:003
Glorious
things
are
spoken
of
thee,
O
city
of
God.
Selah.
087:004
I
will
make
mention
of
Rahab
and
Babylon
to
them
that
know
me:
behold
Philistia,
and
Tyre,
with
Ethiopia;
this
man
was
born
there.
087:005
And
of
Zion
it
shall
be
said,
This
and
that
man
was
born
in
her:
and
the
highest
himself
shall
establish
her.
087:006
The
LORD
shall
count,
when
he
writeth
up
the
people,
that
this
man
was
born
there.
Selah.
087:007
As
well
the
singers
as
the
players
on
instruments
shall
be
there:
all
my
springs
are
in
thee.
088:001
O
lord
God
of
my
salvation,
I
have
cried
day
and
night
before
thee:
088:002
Let
my
prayer
come
before
thee:
incline
thine
ear
unto
my
cry;
088:003
For
my
soul
is
full
of
troubles:
and
my
life
draweth
nigh
unto
the
grave.
088:004
I
am
counted
with
them
that
go
down
into
the
pit:
I
am
as
a
man
that
hath
no
strength:
088:005
Free
among
the
dead,
like
the
slain
that
lie
in
the
grave,
whom
thou
rememberest
no
more:
and
they
are
cut
off
from
thy
hand.
088:006
Thou
hast
laid
me
in
the
lowest
pit,
in
darkness,
in
the
deeps.
088:007
Thy
wrath
lieth
hard
upon
me,
and
thou
hast
afflicted
me
with
all
thy
waves.
Selah.
088:008
Thou
hast
put
away
mine
acquaintance
far
from
me;
thou
hast
made
me
an
abomination
unto
them:
I
am
shut
up,
and
I
cannot
come
forth.
088:009
Mine
eye
mourneth
by
reason
of
affliction:
LORD,
I
have
called
daily
upon
thee,
I
have
stretched
out
my
hands
unto
thee.
088:010
Wilt
thou
shew
wonders
to
the
dead?
shall
the
dead
arise
and
praise
thee?
Selah.
088:011
Shall
thy
lovingkindness
be
declared
in
the
grave?
or
thy
faithfulness
in
destruction?
088:012
Shall
thy
wonders
be
known
in
the
dark?
and
thy
righteousness
in
the
land
of
forgetfulness?
088:013
But
unto
thee
have
I
cried,
O
LORD;
and
in
the
morning
shall
my
prayer
prevent
thee.
088:014
LORD,
why
castest
thou
off
my
soul?
why
hidest
thou
thy
face
from
me?
088:015
I
am
afflicted
and
ready
to
die
from
my
youth
up:
while
I
suffer
thy
terrors
I
am
distracted.
088:016
Thy
fierce
wrath
goeth
over
me;
thy
terrors
have
cut
me
off.
088:017
They
came
round
about
me
daily
like
water;
they
compassed
me
about
together.
088:018
Lover
and
friend
hast
thou
put
far
from
me,
and
mine
acquaintance
into
darkness.
089:001
I
will
sing
of
the
mercies
of
the
LORD
for
ever:
with
my
mouth
will
I
make
known
thy
faithfulness
to
all
generations.
089:002
For
I
have
said,
Mercy
shall
be
built
up
for
ever:
thy
faithfulness
shalt
thou
establish
in
the
very
heavens.
089:003
I
have
made
a
covenant
with
my
chosen,
I
have
sworn
unto
David
my
servant,
089:004
Thy
seed
will
I
establish
for
ever,
and
build
up
thy
throne
to
all
generations.
Selah.
089:005
And
the
heavens
shall
praise
thy
wonders,
O
LORD:
thy
faithfulness
also
in
the
congregation
of
the
saints.
089:006
For
who
in
the
heaven
can
be
compared
unto
the
LORD?
who
among
the
sons
of
the
mighty
can
be
likened
unto
the
LORD?
089:007
God
is
greatly
to
be
feared
in
the
assembly
of
the
saints,
and
to
be
had
in
reverence
of
all
them
that
are
about
him.
089:008
O
LORD
God
of
hosts,
who
is
a
strong
LORD
like
unto
thee?
or
to
thy
faithfulness
round
about
thee?
089:009
Thou
rulest
the
raging
of
the
sea:
when
the
waves
thereof
arise,
thou
stillest
them.
089:010
Thou
hast
broken
Rahab
in
pieces,
as
one
that
is
slain;
thou
hast
scattered
thine
enemies
with
thy
strong
arm.
089:011
The
heavens
are
thine,
the
earth
also
is
thine:
as
for
the
world
and
the
fulness
thereof,
thou
hast
founded
them.
089:012
The
north
and
the
south
thou
hast
created
them:
Tabor
and
Hermon
shall
rejoice
in
thy
name.
089:013
Thou
hast
a
mighty
arm:
strong
is
thy
hand,
and
high
is
thy
right
hand.
089:014
Justice
and
judgment
are
the
habitation
of
thy
throne:
mercy
and
truth
shall
go
before
thy
face.
089:015
Blessed
is
the
people
that
know
the
joyful
sound:
they
shall
walk,
O
LORD,
in
the
light
of
thy
countenance.
089:016
In
thy
name
shall
they
rejoice
all
the
day:
and
in
thy
righteousness
shall
they
be
exalted.
089:017
For
thou
art
the
glory
of
their
strength:
and
in
thy
favour
our
horn
shall
be
exalted.
089:018
For
the
LORD
is
our
defence;
and
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
is
our
king.
089:019
Then
thou
spakest
in
vision
to
thy
holy
one,
and
saidst,
I
have
laid
help
upon
one
that
is
mighty;
I
have
exalted
one
chosen
out
of
the
people.
089:020
I
have
found
David
my
servant;
with
my
holy
oil
have
I
anointed
him:
089:021
With
whom
my
hand
shall
be
established:
mine
arm
also
shall
strengthen
him.
089:022
The
enemy
shall
not
exact
upon
him;
nor
the
son
of
wickedness
afflict
him.
089:023
And
I
will
beat
down
his
foes
before
his
face,
and
plague
them
that
hate
him.
089:024
But
my
faithfulness
and
my
mercy
shall
be
with
him:
and
in
my
name
shall
his
horn
be
exalted.
089:025
I
will
set
his
hand
also
in
the
sea,
and
his
right
hand
in
the
rivers.
089:026
He
shall
cry
unto
me,
Thou
art
my
father,
my
God,
and
the
rock
of
my
salvation.
089:027
Also
I
will
make
him
my
firstborn,
higher
than
the
kings
of
the
earth.
089:028
My
mercy
will
I
keep
for
him
for
evermore,
and
my
covenant
shall
stand
fast
with
him.
089:029
His
seed
also
will
I
make
to
endure
for
ever,
and
his
throne
as
the
days
of
heaven.
089:030
If
his
children
forsake
my
law,
and
walk
not
in
my
judgments;
089:031
If
they
break
my
statutes,
and
keep
not
my
commandments;
089:032
Then
will
I
visit
their
transgression
with
the
rod,
and
their
iniquity
with
stripes.
089:033
Nevertheless
my
lovingkindness
will
I
not
utterly
take
from
him,
nor
suffer
my
faithfulness
to
fail.
089:034
My
covenant
will
I
not
break,
nor
alter
the
thing
that
is
gone
out
of
my
lips.
089:035
Once
have
I
sworn
by
my
holiness
that
I
will
not
lie
unto
David.
089:036
His
seed
shall
endure
for
ever,
and
his
throne
as
the
sun
before
me.
089:037
It
shall
be
established
for
ever
as
the
moon,
and
as
a
faithful
witness
in
heaven.
Selah.
089:038
But
thou
hast
cast
off
and
abhorred,
thou
hast
been
wroth
with
thine
anointed.
089:039
Thou
hast
made
void
the
covenant
of
thy
servant:
thou
hast
profaned
his
crown
by
casting
it
to
the
ground.
089:040
Thou
hast
broken
down
all
his
hedges;
thou
hast
brought
his
strong
holds
to
ruin.
089:041
All
that
pass
by
the
way
spoil
him:
he
is
a
reproach
to
his
neighbours.
089:042
Thou
hast
set
up
the
right
hand
of
his
adversaries;
thou
hast
made
all
his
enemies
to
rejoice.
089:043
Thou
hast
also
turned
the
edge
of
his
sword,
and
hast
not
made
him
to
stand
in
the
battle.
089:044
Thou
hast
made
his
glory
to
cease,
and
cast
his
throne
down
to
the
ground.
089:045
The
days
of
his
youth
hast
thou
shortened:
thou
hast
covered
him
with
shame.
Selah.
089:046
How
long,
LORD?
wilt
thou
hide
thyself
for
ever?
shall
thy
wrath
burn
like
fire?
089:047
Remember
how
short
my
time
is:
wherefore
hast
thou
made
all
men
in
vain?
089:048
What
man
is
he
that
liveth,
and
shall
not
see
death?
shall
he
deliver
his
soul
from
the
hand
of
the
grave?
Selah.
089:049
Lord,
where
are
thy
former
lovingkindnesses,
which
thou
swarest
unto
David
in
thy
truth?
089:050
Remember,
Lord,
the
reproach
of
thy
servants;
how
I
do
bear
in
my
bosom
the
reproach
of
all
the
mighty
people;
089:051
Wherewith
thine
enemies
have
reproached,
O
LORD;
wherewith
they
have
reproached
the
footsteps
of
thine
anointed.
089:052
Blessed
be
the
LORD
for
evermore.
Amen,
and
Amen.
090:001
Lord,
thou
hast
been
our
dwelling
place
in
all
generations.
090:002
Before
the
mountains
were
brought
forth,
or
ever
thou
hadst
formed
the
earth
and
the
world,
even
from
everlasting
to
everlasting,
thou
art
God.
090:003
Thou
turnest
man
to
destruction;
and
sayest,
Return,
ye
children
of
men.
090:004
For
a
thousand
years
in
thy
sight
are
but
as
yesterday
when
it
is
past,
and
as
a
watch
in
the
night.
090:005
Thou
carriest
them
away
as
with
a
flood;
they
are
as
a
sleep:
in
the
morning
they
are
like
grass
which
groweth
up.
090:006
In
the
morning
it
flourisheth,
and
groweth
up;
in
the
evening
it
is
cut
down,
and
withereth.
090:007
For
we
are
consumed
by
thine
anger,
and
by
thy
wrath
are
we
troubled.
090:008
Thou
hast
set
our
iniquities
before
thee,
our
secret
sins
in
the
light
of
thy
countenance.
090:009
For
all
our
days
are
passed
away
in
thy
wrath:
we
spend
our
years
as
a
tale
that
is
told.
090:010
The
days
of
our
years
are
threescore
years
and
ten;
and
if
by
reason
of
strength
they
be
fourscore
years,
yet
is
their
strength
labour
and
sorrow;
for
it
is
soon
cut
off,
and
we
fly
away.
090:011
Who
knoweth
the
power
of
thine
anger?
even
according
to
thy
fear,
so
is
thy
wrath.
090:012
So
teach
us
to
number
our
days,
that
we
may
apply
our
hearts
unto
wisdom.
090:013
Return,
O
LORD,
how
long?
and
let
it
repent
thee
concerning
thy
servants.
090:014
O
satisfy
us
early
with
thy
mercy;
that
we
may
rejoice
and
be
glad
all
our
days.
090:015
Make
us
glad
according
to
the
days
wherein
thou
hast
afflicted
us,
and
the
years
wherein
we
have
seen
evil.
090:016
Let
thy
work
appear
unto
thy
servants,
and
thy
glory
unto
their
children.
090:017
And
let
the
beauty
of
the
LORD
our
God
be
upon
us:
and
establish
thou
the
work
of
our
hands
upon
us;
yea,
the
work
of
our
hands
establish
thou
it.
091:001
He
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
High
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
Almighty.
091:002
I
will
say
of
the
LORD,
He
is
my
refuge
and
my
fortress:
my
God;
in
him
will
I
trust.
091:003
Surely
he
shall
deliver
thee
from
the
snare
of
the
fowler,
and
from
the
noisome
pestilence.
091:004
He
shall
cover
thee
with
his
feathers,
and
under
his
wings
shalt
thou
trust:
his
truth
shall
be
thy
shield
and
buckler.
091:005
Thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night;
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day;
091:006
Nor
for
the
pestilence
that
walketh
in
darkness;
nor
for
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
noonday.
091:007
A
thousand
shall
fall
at
thy
side,
and
ten
thousand
at
thy
right
hand;
but
it
shall
not
come
nigh
thee.
091:008
Only
with
thine
eyes
shalt
thou
behold
and
see
the
reward
of
the
wicked.
091:009
Because
thou
hast
made
the
LORD,
which
is
my
refuge,
even
the
most
High,
thy
habitation;
091:010
There
shall
no
evil
befall
thee,
neither
shall
any
plague
come
nigh
thy
dwelling.
091:011
For
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee,
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
ways.
091:012
They
shall
bear
thee
up
in
their
hands,
lest
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone.
091:013
Thou
shalt
tread
upon
the
lion
and
adder:
the
young
lion
and
the
dragon
shalt
thou
trample
under
feet.
091:014
Because
he
hath
set
his
love
upon
me,
therefore
will
I
deliver
him:
I
will
set
him
on
high,
because
he
hath
known
my
name.
091:015
He
shall
call
upon
me,
and
I
will
answer
him:
I
will
be
with
him
in
trouble;
I
will
deliver
him,
and
honour
him.
091:016
With
long
life
will
I
satisfy
him,
and
shew
him
my
salvation.
092:001
IT
IS
A
GOOD
THING
TO
GIVE
THANKS
UNTO
THE
LORD,
AND
TO
SING
PRAISES
UNTO
THY
NAME,
O
MOST
HIGH:
092:002
To
shew
forth
thy
lovingkindness
in
the
morning,
and
thy
faithfulness
every
night,
092:003
Upon
an
instrument
of
ten
strings,
and
upon
the
psaltery;
upon
the
harp
with
a
solemn
sound.
092:004
For
thou,
LORD,
hast
made
me
glad
through
thy
work:
I
will
triumph
in
the
works
of
thy
hands.
092:005
O
LORD,
how
great
are
thy
works!
and
thy
thoughts
are
very
deep.
092:006
A
brutish
man
knoweth
not;
neither
doth
a
fool
understand
this.
092:007
When
the
wicked
spring
as
the
grass,
and
when
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
do
flourish;
it
is
that
they
shall
be
destroyed
for
ever:
092:008
But
thou,
LORD,
art
most
high
for
evermore.
092:009
For,
lo,
thine
enemies,
O
LORD,
for,
lo,
thine
enemies
shall
perish;
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
shall
be
scattered.
092:010
But
my
horn
shalt
thou
exalt
like
the
horn
of
an
unicorn:
I
shall
be
anointed
with
fresh
oil.
092:011
Mine
eye
also
shall
see
my
desire
on
mine
enemies,
and
mine
ears
shall
hear
my
desire
of
the
wicked
that
rise
up
against
me.
092:012
The
righteous
shall
flourish
like
the
palm
tree:
he
shall
grow
like
a
cedar
in
Lebanon.
092:013
Those
that
be
planted
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
shall
flourish
in
the
courts
of
our
God.
092:014
They
shall
still
bring
forth
fruit
in
old
age;
they
shall
be
fat
and
flourishing;
092:015
To
shew
that
the
LORD
is
upright:
he
is
my
rock,
and
there
is
no
unrighteousness
in
him.
093:001
The
LORD
reigneth,
he
is
clothed
with
majesty;
the
LORD
is
clothed
with
strength,
wherewith
he
hath
girded
himself:
the
world
also
is
stablished,
that
it
cannot
be
moved.
093:002
Thy
throne
is
established
of
old:
thou
art
from
everlasting.
093:003
The
floods
have
lifted
up,
O
LORD,
the
floods
have
lifted
up
their
voice;
the
floods
lift
up
their
waves.
093:004
The
LORD
on
high
is
mightier
than
the
noise
of
many
waters,
yea,
than
the
mighty
waves
of
the
sea.
093:005
Thy
testimonies
are
very
sure:
holiness
becometh
thine
house,
O
LORD,
for
ever.
094:001
O
Lord
God,
to
whom
vengeance
belongeth;
O
God,
to
whom
vengeance
belongeth,
shew
thyself.
094:002
Lift
up
thyself,
thou
judge
of
the
earth:
render
a
reward
to
the
proud.
094:003
LORD,
how
long
shall
the
wicked,
how
long
shall
the
wicked
triumph?
094:004
How
long
shall
they
utter
and
speak
hard
things?
and
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
boast
themselves?
094:005
They
break
in
pieces
thy
people,
O
LORD,
and
afflict
thine
heritage.
094:006
They
slay
the
widow
