and
the
stranger,
and
murder
the
fatherless.
094:007
Yet
they
say,
The
LORD
shall
not
see,
neither
shall
the
God
of
Jacob
regard
it.
094:008
Understand,
ye
brutish
among
the
people:
and
ye
fools,
when
will
ye
be
wise?
094:009
He
that
planted
the
ear,
shall
he
not
hear?
he
that
formed
the
eye,
shall
he
not
see?
094:010
He
that
chastiseth
the
heathen,
shall
not
he
correct?
he
that
teacheth
man
knowledge,
shall
not
he
know?
094:011
The
LORD
knoweth
the
thoughts
of
man,
that
they
are
vanity.
094:012
Blessed
is
the
man
whom
thou
chastenest,
O
LORD,
and
teachest
him
out
of
thy
law;
094:013
That
thou
mayest
give
him
rest
from
the
days
of
adversity,
until
the
pit
be
digged
for
the
wicked.
094:014
For
the
LORD
will
not
cast
off
his
people,
neither
will
he
forsake
his
inheritance.
094:015
But
judgment
shall
return
unto
righteousness:
and
all
the
upright
in
heart
shall
follow
it.
094:016
Who
will
rise
up
for
me
against
the
evildoers?
or
who
will
stand
up
for
me
against
the
workers
of
iniquity?
094:017
Unless
the
LORD
had
been
my
help,
my
soul
had
almost
dwelt
in
silence.
094:018
When
I
said,
My
foot
slippeth;
thy
mercy,
O
LORD,
held
me
up.
094:019
In
the
multitude
of
my
thoughts
within
me
thy
comforts
delight
my
soul.
094:020
Shall
the
throne
of
iniquity
have
fellowship
with
thee,
which
frameth
mischief
by
a
law?
094:021
They
gather
themselves
together
against
the
soul
of
the
righteous,
and
condemn
the
innocent
blood.
094:022
But
the
LORD
is
my
defence;
and
my
God
is
the
rock
of
my
refuge.
094:023
And
he
shall
bring
upon
them
their
own
iniquity,
and
shall
cut
them
off
in
their
own
wickedness;
yea,
the
LORD
our
God
shall
cut
them
off.
095:001
O
come,
let
us
sing
unto
the
LORD:
let
us
make
a
joyful
noise
to
the
rock
of
our
salvation.
095:002
Let
us
come
before
his
presence
with
thanksgiving,
and
make
a
joyful
noise
unto
him
with
psalms.
095:003
For
the
LORD
is
a
great
God,
and
a
great
King
above
all
gods.
095:004
In
his
hand
are
the
deep
places
of
the
earth:
the
strength
of
the
hills
is
his
also.
095:005
The
sea
is
his,
and
he
made
it:
and
his
hands
formed
the
dry
land.
095:006
O
come,
let
us
worship
and
bow
down:
let
us
kneel
before
the
LORD
our
maker.
095:007
For
he
is
our
God;
and
we
are
the
people
of
his
pasture,
and
the
sheep
of
his
hand.
To
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice,
095:008
Harden
not
your
heart,
as
in
the
provocation,
and
as
in
the
day
of
temptation
in
the
wilderness:
095:009
When
your
fathers
tempted
me,
proved
me,
and
saw
my
work.
095:010
Forty
years
long
was
I
grieved
with
this
generation,
and
said,
It
is
a
people
that
do
err
in
their
heart,
and
they
have
not
known
my
ways:
095:011
Unto
whom
I
sware
in
my
wrath
that
they
should
not
enter
into
my
rest.
096:001
O
sing
unto
the
LORD
a
new
song:
sing
unto
the
LORD,
all
the
earth.
096:002
Sing
unto
the
LORD,
bless
his
name;
shew
forth
his
salvation
from
day
to
day.
096:003
Declare
his
glory
among
the
heathen,
his
wonders
among
all
people.
096:004
For
the
LORD
is
great,
and
greatly
to
be
praised:
he
is
to
be
feared
above
all
gods.
096:005
For
all
the
gods
of
the
nations
are
idols:
but
the
LORD
made
the
heavens.
096:006
Honour
and
majesty
are
before
him:
strength
and
beauty
are
in
his
sanctuary.
096:007
Give
unto
the
LORD,
O
ye
kindreds
of
the
people,
give
unto
the
LORD
glory
and
strength.
096:008
Give
unto
the
LORD
the
glory
due
unto
his
name:
bring
an
offering,
and
come
into
his
courts.
096:009
O
worship
the
LORD
in
the
beauty
of
holiness:
fear
before
him,
all
the
earth.
096:010
Say
among
the
heathen
that
the
LORD
reigneth:
the
world
also
shall
be
established
that
it
shall
not
be
moved:
he
shall
judge
the
people
righteously.
096:011
Let
the
heavens
rejoice,
and
let
the
earth
be
glad;
let
the
sea
roar,
and
the
fulness
thereof.
096:012
Let
the
field
be
joyful,
and
all
that
is
therein:
then
shall
all
the
trees
of
the
wood
rejoice
096:013
Before
the
LORD:
for
he
cometh,
for
he
cometh
to
judge
the
earth:
he
shall
judge
the
world
with
righteousness,
and
the
people
with
his
truth.
097:001
The
LORD
reigneth;
let
the
earth
rejoice;
let
the
multitude
of
isles
be
glad
thereof.
097:002
Clouds
and
darkness
are
round
about
him:
righteousness
and
judgment
are
the
habitation
of
his
throne.
097:003
A
fire
goeth
before
him,
and
burneth
up
his
enemies
round
about.
097:004
His
lightnings
enlightened
the
world:
the
earth
saw,
and
trembled.
097:005
The
hills
melted
like
wax
at
the
presence
of
the
LORD,
at
the
presence
of
the
Lord
of
the
whole
earth.
097:006
The
heavens
declare
his
righteousness,
and
all
the
people
see
his
glory.
097:007
Confounded
be
all
they
that
serve
graven
images,
that
boast
themselves
of
idols:
worship
him,
all
ye
gods.
097:008
Zion
heard,
and
was
glad;
and
the
daughters
of
Judah
rejoiced
because
of
thy
judgments,
O
LORD.
097:009
For
thou,
LORD,
art
high
above
all
the
earth:
thou
art
exalted
far
above
all
gods.
097:010
Ye
that
love
the
LORD,
hate
evil:
he
preserveth
the
souls
of
his
saints;
he
delivereth
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked.
097:011
Light
is
sown
for
the
righteous,
and
gladness
for
the
upright
in
heart.
097:012
Rejoice
in
the
LORD,
ye
righteous;
and
give
thanks
at
the
remembrance
of
his
holiness.
098:001
O
sing
unto
the
LORD
a
new
song;
for
he
hath
done
marvellous
things:
his
right
hand,
and
his
holy
arm,
hath
gotten
him
the
victory.
098:002
The
LORD
hath
made
known
his
salvation:
his
righteousness
hath
he
openly
shewed
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen.
098:003
He
hath
remembered
his
mercy
and
his
truth
toward
the
house
of
Israel:
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
have
seen
the
salvation
of
our
God.
098:004
Make
a
joyful
noise
unto
the
LORD,
all
the
earth:
make
a
loud
noise,
and
rejoice,
and
sing
praise.
098:005
Sing
unto
the
LORD
with
the
harp;
with
the
harp,
and
the
voice
of
a
psalm.
098:006
With
trumpets
and
sound
of
cornet
make
a
joyful
noise
before
the
LORD,
the
King.
098:007
Let
the
sea
roar,
and
the
fulness
thereof;
the
world,
and
they
that
dwell
therein.
098:008
Let
the
floods
clap
their
hands:
let
the
hills
be
joyful
together
098:009
Before
the
LORD;
for
he
cometh
to
judge
the
earth:
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge
the
world,
and
the
people
with
equity.
099:001
The
LORD
reigneth;
let
the
people
tremble:
he
sitteth
between
the
cherubims;
let
the
earth
be
moved.
099:002
The
LORD
is
great
in
Zion;
and
he
is
high
above
all
the
people.
099:003
Let
them
praise
thy
great
and
terrible
name;
for
it
is
holy.
099:004
The
king's
strength
also
loveth
judgment;
thou
dost
establish
equity,
thou
executest
judgment
and
righteousness
in
Jacob.
099:005
Exalt
ye
the
LORD
our
God,
and
worship
at
his
footstool;
for
he
is
holy.
099:006
Moses
and
Aaron
among
his
priests,
and
Samuel
among
them
that
call
upon
his
name;
they
called
upon
the
LORD,
and
he
answered
them.
099:007
He
spake
unto
them
in
the
cloudy
pillar:
they
kept
his
testimonies,
and
the
ordinance
that
he
gave
them.
099:008
Thou
answeredst
them,
O
LORD
our
God:
thou
wast
a
God
that
forgavest
them,
though
thou
tookest
vengeance
of
their
inventions.
099:009
Exalt
the
LORD
our
God,
and
worship
at
his
holy
hill;
for
the
LORD
our
God
is
holy.
100:001
Make
a
joyful
noise
unto
the
LORD,
all
ye
lands.
100:002
Serve
the
LORD
with
gladness:
come
before
his
presence
with
singing.
100:003
Know
ye
that
the
LORD
he
is
God:
it
is
he
that
hath
made
us,
and
not
we
ourselves;
we
are
his
people,
and
the
sheep
of
his
pasture.
100:004
Enter
into
his
gates
with
thanksgiving,
and
into
his
courts
with
praise:
be
thankful
unto
him,
and
bless
his
name.
100:005
For
the
LORD
is
good;
his
mercy
is
everlasting;
and
his
truth
endureth
to
all
generations.
101:001
I
will
sing
of
mercy
and
judgment:
unto
thee,
O
LORD,
will
I
sing.
101:002
I
will
behave
myself
wisely
in
a
perfect
way.
O
when
wilt
thou
come
unto
me?
I
will
walk
within
my
house
with
a
perfect
heart.
101:003
I
will
set
no
wicked
thing
before
mine
eyes:
I
hate
the
work
of
them
that
turn
aside;
it
shall
not
cleave
to
me.
101:004
A
froward
heart
shall
depart
from
me:
I
will
not
know
a
wicked
person.
101:005
Whoso
privily
slandereth
his
neighbour,
him
will
I
cut
off:
him
that
hath
an
high
look
and
a
proud
heart
will
not
I
suffer.
101:006
Mine
eyes
shall
be
upon
the
faithful
of
the
land,
that
they
may
dwell
with
me:
he
that
walketh
in
a
perfect
way,
he
shall
serve
me.
101:007
He
that
worketh
deceit
shall
not
dwell
within
my
house:
he
that
telleth
lies
shall
not
tarry
in
my
sight.
101:008
I
will
early
destroy
all
the
wicked
of
the
land;
that
I
may
cut
off
all
wicked
doers
from
the
city
of
the
LORD.
102:001
Hear
my
prayer,
O
LORD,
and
let
my
cry
come
unto
thee.
102:002
Hide
not
thy
face
from
me
in
the
day
when
I
am
in
trouble;
incline
thine
ear
unto
me:
in
the
day
when
I
call
answer
me
speedily.
102:003
For
my
days
are
consumed
like
smoke,
and
my
bones
are
burned
as
an
hearth.
102:004
My
heart
is
smitten,
and
withered
like
grass;
so
that
I
forget
to
eat
my
bread.
102:005
By
reason
of
the
voice
of
my
groaning
my
bones
cleave
to
my
skin.
102:006
I
am
like
a
pelican
of
the
wilderness:
I
am
like
an
owl
of
the
desert.
102:007
I
watch,
and
am
as
a
sparrow
alone
upon
the
house
top.
102:008
Mine
enemies
reproach
me
all
the
day;
and
they
that
are
mad
against
me
are
sworn
against
me.
102:009
For
I
have
eaten
ashes
like
bread,
and
mingled
my
drink
with
weeping.
102:010
Because
of
thine
indignation
and
thy
wrath:
for
thou
hast
lifted
me
up,
and
cast
me
down.
102:011
My
days
are
like
a
shadow
that
declineth;
and
I
am
withered
like
grass.
102:012
But
thou,
O
LORD,
shall
endure
for
ever;
and
thy
remembrance
unto
all
generations.
102:013
Thou
shalt
arise,
and
have
mercy
upon
Zion:
for
the
time
to
favour
her,
yea,
the
set
time,
is
come.
102:014
For
thy
servants
take
pleasure
in
her
stones,
and
favour
the
dust
thereof.
102:015
So
the
heathen
shall
fear
the
name
of
the
LORD,
and
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
thy
glory.
102:016
When
the
LORD
shall
build
up
Zion,
he
shall
appear
in
his
glory.
102:017
He
will
regard
the
prayer
of
the
destitute,
and
not
despise
their
prayer.
102:018
This
shall
be
written
for
the
generation
to
come:
and
the
people
which
shall
be
created
shall
praise
the
LORD.
102:019
For
he
hath
looked
down
from
the
height
of
his
sanctuary;
from
heaven
did
the
LORD
behold
the
earth;
102:020
To
hear
the
groaning
of
the
prisoner;
to
loose
those
that
are
appointed
to
death;
102:021
To
declare
the
name
of
the
LORD
in
Zion,
and
his
praise
in
Jerusalem;
102:022
When
the
people
are
gathered
together,
and
the
kingdoms,
to
serve
the
LORD.
102:023
He
weakened
my
strength
in
the
way;
he
shortened
my
days.
102:024
I
said,
O
my
God,
take
me
not
away
in
the
midst
of
my
days:
thy
years
are
throughout
all
generations.
102:025
Of
old
hast
thou
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth:
and
the
heavens
are
the
work
of
thy
hands.
102:026
They
shall
perish,
but
thou
shalt
endure:
yea,
all
of
them
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment;
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
change
them,
and
they
shall
be
changed:
102:027
But
thou
art
the
same,
and
thy
years
shall
have
no
end.
102:028
The
children
of
thy
servants
shall
continue,
and
their
seed
shall
be
established
before
thee.
103:001
Bless
the
LORD,
O
my
soul:
and
all
that
is
within
me,
bless
his
holy
name.
103:002
Bless
the
LORD,
O
my
soul,
and
forget
not
all
his
benefits:
103:003
Who
forgiveth
all
thine
iniquities;
who
healeth
all
thy
diseases;
103:004
Who
redeemeth
thy
life
from
destruction;
who
crowneth
thee
with
lovingkindness
and
tender
mercies;
103:005
Who
satisfieth
thy
mouth
with
good
things;
so
that
thy
youth
is
renewed
like
the
eagle's.
103:006
The
LORD
executeth
righteousness
and
judgment
for
all
that
are
oppressed.
103:007
He
made
known
his
ways
unto
Moses,
his
acts
unto
the
children
of
Israel.
103:008
The
LORD
is
merciful
and
gracious,
slow
to
anger,
and
plenteous
in
mercy.
103:009
He
will
not
always
chide:
neither
will
he
keep
his
anger
for
ever.
103:010
He
hath
not
dealt
with
us
after
our
sins;
nor
rewarded
us
according
to
our
iniquities.
103:011
For
as
the
heaven
is
high
above
the
earth,
so
great
is
his
mercy
toward
them
that
fear
him.
103:012
As
far
as
the
east
is
from
the
west,
so
far
hath
he
removed
our
transgressions
from
us.
103:013
Like
as
a
father
pitieth
his
children,
so
the
LORD
pitieth
them
that
fear
him.
103:014
For
he
knoweth
our
frame;
he
remembereth
that
we
are
dust.
103:015
As
for
man,
his
days
are
as
grass:
as
a
flower
of
the
field,
so
he
flourisheth.
103:016
For
the
wind
passeth
over
it,
and
it
is
gone;
and
the
place
thereof
shall
know
it
no
more.
103:017
But
the
mercy
of
the
LORD
is
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
upon
them
that
fear
him,
and
his
righteousness
unto
children's
children;
103:018
To
such
as
keep
his
covenant,
and
to
those
that
remember
his
commandments
to
do
them.
103:019
The
LORD
hath
prepared
his
throne
in
the
heavens;
and
his
kingdom
ruleth
over
all.
103:020
Bless
the
LORD,
ye
his
angels,
that
excel
in
strength,
that
do
his
commandments,
hearkening
unto
the
voice
of
his
word.
103:021
Bless
ye
the
LORD,
all
ye
his
hosts;
ye
ministers
of
his,
that
do
his
pleasure.
103:022
Bless
the
LORD,
all
his
works
in
all
places
of
his
dominion:
bless
the
LORD,
O
my
soul.
104:001
Bless
the
LORD,
O
my
soul.
O
LORD
my
God,
thou
art
very
great;
thou
art
clothed
with
honour
and
majesty.
104:002
Who
coverest
thyself
with
light
as
with
a
garment:
who
stretchest
out
the
heavens
like
a
curtain:
104:003
Who
layeth
the
beams
of
his
chambers
in
the
waters:
who
maketh
the
clouds
his
chariot:
who
walketh
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind:
104:004
Who
maketh
his
angels
spirits;
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire:
104:005
Who
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth,
that
it
should
not
be
removed
for
ever.
104:006
Thou
coveredst
it
with
the
deep
as
with
a
garment:
the
waters
stood
above
the
mountains.
104:007
At
thy
rebuke
they
fled;
at
the
voice
of
thy
thunder
they
hasted
away.
104:008
They
go
up
by
the
mountains;
they
go
down
by
the
valleys
unto
the
place
which
thou
hast
founded
for
them.
104:009
Thou
hast
set
a
bound
that
they
may
not
pass
over;
that
they
turn
not
again
to
cover
the
earth.
104:010
He
sendeth
the
springs
into
the
valleys,
which
run
among
the
hills.
104:011
They
give
drink
to
every
beast
of
the
field:
the
wild
asses
quench
their
thirst.
104:012
By
them
shall
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
have
their
habitation,
which
sing
among
the
branches.
104:013
He
watereth
the
hills
from
his
chambers:
the
earth
is
satisfied
with
the
fruit
of
thy
works.
104:014
He
causeth
the
grass
to
grow
for
the
cattle,
and
herb
for
the
service
of
man:
that
he
may
bring
forth
food
out
of
the
earth;
104:015
And
wine
that
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man,
and
oil
to
make
his
face
to
shine,
and
bread
which
strengtheneth
man's
heart.
104:016
The
trees
of
the
LORD
are
full
of
sap;
the
cedars
of
Lebanon,
which
he
hath
planted;
104:017
Where
the
birds
make
their
nests:
as
for
the
stork,
the
fir
trees
are
her
house.
104:018
The
high
hills
are
a
refuge
for
the
wild
goats;
and
the
rocks
for
the
conies.
104:019
He
appointed
the
moon
for
seasons:
the
sun
knoweth
his
going
down.
104:020
Thou
makest
darkness,
and
it
is
night:
wherein
all
the
beasts
of
the
forest
do
creep
forth.
104:021
The
young
lions
roar
after
their
prey,
and
seek
their
meat
from
God.
104:022
The
sun
ariseth,
they
gather
themselves
together,
and
lay
them
down
in
their
dens.
104:023
Man
goeth
forth
unto
his
work
and
to
his
labour
until
the
evening.
104:024
O
LORD,
how
manifold
are
thy
works!
in
wisdom
hast
thou
made
them
all:
the
earth
is
full
of
thy
riches.
104:025
So
is
this
great
and
wide
sea,
wherein
are
things
creeping
innumerable,
both
small
and
great
beasts.
104:026
There
go
the
ships:
there
is
that
leviathan,
whom
thou
hast
made
to
play
therein.
104:027
These
wait
all
upon
thee;
that
thou
mayest
give
them
their
meat
in
due
season.
104:028
That
thou
givest
them
they
gather:
thou
openest
thine
hand,
they
are
filled
with
good.
104:029
Thou
hidest
thy
face,
they
are
troubled:
thou
takest
away
their
breath,
they
die,
and
return
to
their
dust.
104:030
Thou
sendest
forth
thy
spirit,
they
are
created:
and
thou
renewest
the
face
of
the
earth.
104:031
The
glory
of
the
LORD
shall
endure
for
ever:
the
LORD
shall
rejoice
in
his
works.
104:032
He
looketh
on
the
earth,
and
it
trembleth:
he
toucheth
the
hills,
and
they
smoke.
104:033
I
will
sing
unto
the
LORD
as
long
as
I
live:
I
will
sing
praise
to
my
God
while
I
have
my
being.
104:034
My
meditation
of
him
shall
be
sweet:
I
will
be
glad
in
the
LORD.
104:035
Let
the
sinners
be
consumed
out
of
the
earth,
and
let
the
wicked
be
no
more.
Bless
thou
the
LORD,
O
my
soul.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
105:001
O
give
thanks
unto
the
LORD;
call
upon
his
name:
make
known
his
deeds
among
the
people.
105:002
Sing
unto
him,
sing
psalms
unto
him:
talk
ye
of
all
his
wondrous
works.
105:003
Glory
ye
in
his
holy
name:
let
the
heart
of
them
rejoice
that
seek
the
LORD.
105:004
Seek
the
LORD,
and
his
strength:
seek
his
face
evermore.
105:005
Remember
his
marvellous
works
that
he
hath
done;
his
wonders,
and
the
judgments
of
his
mouth;
105:006
O
ye
seed
of
Abraham
his
servant,
ye
children
of
Jacob
his
chosen.
105:007
He
is
the
LORD
our
God:
his
judgments
are
in
all
the
earth.
105:008
He
hath
remembered
his
covenant
for
ever,
the
word
which
he
commanded
to
a
thousand
generations.
105:009
Which
covenant
he
made
with
Abraham,
and
his
oath
unto
Isaac;
105:010
And
confirmed
the
same
unto
Jacob
for
a
law,
and
to
Israel
for
an
everlasting
covenant:
105:011
Saying,
Unto
thee
will
I
give
the
land
of
Canaan,
the
lot
of
your
inheritance:
105:012
When
they
were
but
a
few
men
in
number;
yea,
very
few,
and
strangers
in
it.
105:013
When
they
went
from
one
nation
to
another,
from
one
kingdom
to
another
people;
105:014
He
suffered
no
man
to
do
them
wrong:
yea,
he
reproved
kings
for
their
sakes;
105:015
Saying,
Touch
not
mine
anointed,
and
do
my
prophets
no
harm.
105:016
Moreover
he
called
for
a
famine
upon
the
land:
he
brake
the
whole
staff
of
bread.
105:017
He
sent
a
man
before
them,
even
Joseph,
who
was
sold
for
a
servant:
105:018
Whose
feet
they
hurt
with
fetters:
he
was
laid
in
iron:
105:019
Until
the
time
that
his
word
came:
the
word
of
the
LORD
tried
him.
105:020
The
king
sent
and
loosed
him;
even
the
ruler
of
the
people,
and
let
him
go
free.
105:021
He
made
him
lord
of
his
house,
and
ruler
of
all
his
substance:
105:022
To
bind
his
princes
at
his
pleasure;
and
teach
his
senators
wisdom.
105:023
Israel
also
came
into
Egypt;
and
Jacob
sojourned
in
the
land
of
Ham.
105:024
And
he
increased
his
people
greatly;
and
made
them
stronger
than
their
enemies.
105:025
He
turned
their
heart
to
hate
his
people,
to
deal
subtilly
with
his
servants.
105:026
He
sent
Moses
his
servant;
and
Aaron
whom
he
had
chosen.
105:027
They
shewed
his
signs
among
them,
and
wonders
in
the
land
of
Ham.
105:028
He
sent
darkness,
and
made
it
dark;
and
they
rebelled
not
against
his
word.
105:029
He
turned
their
waters
into
blood,
and
slew
their
fish.
105:030
Their
land
brought
forth
frogs
in
abundance,
in
the
chambers
of
their
kings.
105:031
He
spake,
and
there
came
divers
sorts
of
flies,
and
lice
in
all
their
coasts.
105:032
He
gave
them
hail
for
rain,
and
flaming
fire
in
their
land.
105:033
He
smote
their
vines
also
and
their
fig
trees;
and
brake
the
trees
of
their
coasts.
105:034
He
spake,
and
the
locusts
came,
and
caterpillers,
and
that
without
number,
105:035
And
did
eat
up
all
the
herbs
in
their
land,
and
devoured
the
fruit
of
their
ground.
105:036
He
smote
also
all
the
firstborn
in
their
land,
the
chief
of
all
their
strength.
105:037
He
brought
them
forth
also
with
silver
and
gold:
and
there
was
not
one
feeble
person
among
their
tribes.
105:038
Egypt
was
glad
when
they
departed:
for
the
fear
of
them
fell
upon
them.
105:039
He
spread
a
cloud
for
a
covering;
and
fire
to
give
light
in
the
night.
105:040
The
people
asked,
and
he
brought
quails,
and
satisfied
them
with
the
bread
of
heaven.
105:041
He
opened
the
rock,
and
the
waters
gushed
out;
they
ran
in
the
dry
places
like
a
river.
105:042
For
he
remembered
his
holy
promise,
and
Abraham
his
servant.
105:043
And
he
brought
forth
his
people
with
joy,
and
his
chosen
with
gladness:
105:044
And
gave
them
the
lands
of
the
heathen:
and
they
inherited
the
labour
of
the
people;
105:045
That
they
might
observe
his
statutes,
and
keep
his
laws.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
106:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
O
give
thanks
unto
the
LORD;
for
he
is
good:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
106:002
Who
can
utter
the
mighty
acts
of
the
LORD?
who
can
shew
forth
all
his
praise?
106:003
Blessed
are
they
that
keep
judgment,
and
he
that
doeth
righteousness
at
all
times.
106:004
Remember
me,
O
LORD,
with
the
favour
that
thou
bearest
unto
thy
people:
O
visit
me
with
thy
salvation;
106:005
That
I
may
see
the
good
of
thy
chosen,
that
I
may
rejoice
in
the
gladness
of
thy
nation,
that
I
may
glory
with
thine
inheritance.
106:006
We
have
sinned
with
our
fathers,
we
have
committed
iniquity,
we
have
done
wickedly.
106:007
Our
fathers
understood
not
thy
wonders
in
Egypt;
they
remembered
not
the
multitude
of
thy
mercies;
but
provoked
him
at
the
sea,
even
at
the
Red
sea.
106:008
Nevertheless
he
saved
them
for
his
name's
sake,
that
he
might
make
his
mighty
power
to
be
known.
106:009
He
rebuked
the
Red
sea
also,
and
it
was
dried
up:
so
he
led
them
through
the
depths,
as
through
the
wilderness.
106:010
And
he
saved
them
from
the
hand
of
him
that
hated
them,
and
redeemed
them
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy.
106:011
And
the
waters
covered
their
enemies:
there
was
not
one
of
them
left.
106:012
Then
believed
they
his
words;
they
sang
his
praise.
106:013
They
soon
forgat
his
works;
they
waited
not
for
his
counsel:
106:014
But
lusted
exceedingly
in
the
wilderness,
and
tempted
God
in
the
desert.
106:015
And
he
gave
them
their
request;
but
sent
leanness
into
their
soul.
106:016
They
envied
Moses
also
in
the
camp,
and
Aaron
the
saint
of
the
LORD.
106:017
The
earth
opened
and
swallowed
up
Dathan
and
covered
the
company
of
Abiram.
106:018
And
a
fire
was
kindled
in
their
company;
the
flame
burned
up
the
wicked.
106:019
They
made
a
calf
in
Horeb,
and
worshipped
the
molten
image.
106:020
Thus
they
changed
their
glory
into
the
similitude
of
an
ox
that
eateth
grass.
106:021
They
forgat
God
their
saviour,
which
had
done
great
things
in
Egypt;
106:022
Wondrous
works
in
the
land
of
Ham,
and
terrible
things
by
the
Red
sea.
106:023
Therefore
he
said
that
