he
would
destroy
them,
had
not
Moses
his
chosen
stood
before
him
in
the
breach,
to
turn
away
his
wrath,
lest
he
should
destroy
them.
106:024
Yea,
they
despised
the
pleasant
land,
they
believed
not
his
word:
106:025
But
murmured
in
their
tents,
and
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD.
106:026
Therefore
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
them,
to
overthrow
them
in
the
wilderness:
106:027
To
overthrow
their
seed
also
among
the
nations,
and
to
scatter
them
in
the
lands.
106:028
They
joined
themselves
also
unto
Baalpeor,
and
ate
the
sacrifices
of
the
dead.
106:029
Thus
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
inventions:
and
the
plague
brake
in
upon
them.
106:030
Then
stood
up
Phinehas,
and
executed
judgment:
and
so
the
plague
was
stayed.
106:031
And
that
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
unto
all
generations
for
evermore.
106:032
They
angered
him
also
at
the
waters
of
strife,
so
that
it
went
ill
with
Moses
for
their
sakes:
106:033
Because
they
provoked
his
spirit,
so
that
he
spake
unadvisedly
with
his
lips.
106:034
They
did
not
destroy
the
nations,
concerning
whom
the
LORD
commanded
them:
106:035
But
were
mingled
among
the
heathen,
and
learned
their
works.
106:036
And
they
served
their
idols:
which
were
a
snare
unto
them.
106:037
Yea,
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
unto
devils,
106:038
And
shed
innocent
blood,
even
the
blood
of
their
sons
and
of
their
daughters,
whom
they
sacrificed
unto
the
idols
of
Canaan:
and
the
land
was
polluted
with
blood.
106:039
Thus
were
they
defiled
with
their
own
works,
and
went
a
whoring
with
their
own
inventions.
106:040
Therefore
was
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
kindled
against
his
people,
insomuch
that
he
abhorred
his
own
inheritance.
106:041
And
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
the
heathen;
and
they
that
hated
them
ruled
over
them.
106:042
Their
enemies
also
oppressed
them,
and
they
were
brought
into
subjection
under
their
hand.
106:043
Many
times
did
he
deliver
them;
but
they
provoked
him
with
their
counsel,
and
were
brought
low
for
their
iniquity.
106:044
Nevertheless
he
regarded
their
affliction,
when
he
heard
their
cry:
106:045
And
he
remembered
for
them
his
covenant,
and
repented
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
mercies.
106:046
He
made
them
also
to
be
pitied
of
all
those
that
carried
them
captives.
106:047
Save
us,
O
LORD
our
God,
and
gather
us
from
among
the
heathen,
to
give
thanks
unto
thy
holy
name,
and
to
triumph
in
thy
praise.
106:048
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
from
everlasting
to
everlasting:
and
let
all
the
people
say,
Amen.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
107:001
O
give
thanks
unto
the
LORD,
for
he
is
good:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
107:002
Let
the
redeemed
of
the
LORD
say
so,
whom
he
hath
redeemed
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy;
107:003
And
gathered
them
out
of
the
lands,
from
the
east,
and
from
the
west,
from
the
north,
and
from
the
south.
107:004
They
wandered
in
the
wilderness
in
a
solitary
way;
they
found
no
city
to
dwell
in.
107:005
Hungry
and
thirsty,
their
soul
fainted
in
them.
107:006
Then
they
cried
unto
the
LORD
in
their
trouble,
and
he
delivered
them
out
of
their
distresses.
107:007
And
he
led
them
forth
by
the
right
way,
that
they
might
go
to
a
city
of
habitation.
107:008
Oh
that
men
would
praise
the
LORD
for
his
goodness,
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men!
107:009
For
he
satisfieth
the
longing
soul,
and
filleth
the
hungry
soul
with
goodness.
107:010
Such
as
sit
in
darkness
and
in
the
shadow
of
death,
being
bound
in
affliction
and
iron;
107:011
Because
they
rebelled
against
the
words
of
God,
and
contemned
the
counsel
of
the
most
High:
107:012
Therefore
he
brought
down
their
heart
with
labour;
they
fell
down,
and
there
was
none
to
help.
107:013
Then
they
cried
unto
the
LORD
in
their
trouble,
and
he
saved
them
out
of
their
distresses.
107:014
He
brought
them
out
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death,
and
brake
their
bands
in
sunder.
107:015
Oh
that
men
would
praise
the
LORD
for
his
goodness,
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men!
107:016
For
he
hath
broken
the
gates
of
brass,
and
cut
the
bars
of
iron
in
sunder.
107:017
Fools
because
of
their
transgression,
and
because
of
their
iniquities,
are
afflicted.
107:018
Their
soul
abhorreth
all
manner
of
meat;
and
they
draw
near
unto
the
gates
of
death.
107:019
Then
they
cry
unto
the
LORD
in
their
trouble,
and
he
saveth
them
out
of
their
distresses.
107:020
He
sent
his
word,
and
healed
them,
and
delivered
them
from
their
destructions.
107:021
Oh
that
men
would
praise
the
LORD
for
his
goodness,
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men!
107:022
And
let
them
sacrifice
the
sacrifices
of
thanksgiving,
and
declare
his
works
with
rejoicing.
107:023
They
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships,
that
do
business
in
great
waters;
107:024
These
see
the
works
of
the
LORD,
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep.
107:025
For
he
commandeth,
and
raiseth
the
stormy
wind,
which
lifteth
up
the
waves
thereof.
107:026
They
mount
up
to
the
heaven,
they
go
down
again
to
the
depths:
their
soul
is
melted
because
of
trouble.
107:027
They
reel
to
and
fro,
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
man,
and
are
at
their
wit's
end.
107:028
Then
they
cry
unto
the
LORD
in
their
trouble,
and
he
bringeth
them
out
of
their
distresses.
107:029
He
maketh
the
storm
a
calm,
so
that
the
waves
thereof
are
still.
107:030
Then
are
they
glad
because
they
be
quiet;
so
he
bringeth
them
unto
their
desired
haven.
107:031
Oh
that
men
would
praise
the
LORD
for
his
goodness,
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men!
107:032
Let
them
exalt
him
also
in
the
congregation
of
the
people,
and
praise
him
in
the
assembly
of
the
elders.
107:033
He
turneth
rivers
into
a
wilderness,
and
the
watersprings
into
dry
ground;
107:034
A
fruitful
land
into
barrenness,
for
the
wickedness
of
them
that
dwell
therein.
107:035
He
turneth
the
wilderness
into
a
standing
water,
and
dry
ground
into
watersprings.
107:036
And
there
he
maketh
the
hungry
to
dwell,
that
they
may
prepare
a
city
for
habitation;
107:037
And
sow
the
fields,
and
plant
vineyards,
which
may
yield
fruits
of
increase.
107:038
He
blesseth
them
also,
so
that
they
are
multiplied
greatly;
and
suffereth
not
their
cattle
to
decrease.
107:039
Again,
they
are
minished
and
brought
low
through
oppression,
affliction,
and
sorrow.
107:040
He
poureth
contempt
upon
princes,
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
the
wilderness,
where
there
is
no
way.
107:041
Yet
setteth
he
the
poor
on
high
from
affliction,
and
maketh
him
families
like
a
flock.
107:042
The
righteous
shall
see
it,
and
rejoice:
and
all
iniquity
shall
stop
her
mouth.
107:043
Whoso
is
wise,
and
will
observe
these
things,
even
they
shall
understand
the
lovingkindness
of
the
LORD.
108:001
O
god,
my
heart
is
fixed;
I
will
sing
and
give
praise,
even
with
my
glory.
108:002
Awake,
psaltery
and
harp:
I
myself
will
awake
early.
108:003
I
will
praise
thee,
O
LORD,
among
the
people:
and
I
will
sing
praises
unto
thee
among
the
nations.
108:004
For
thy
mercy
is
great
above
the
heavens:
and
thy
truth
reacheth
unto
the
clouds.
108:005
Be
thou
exalted,
O
God,
above
the
heavens:
and
thy
glory
above
all
the
earth;
108:006
That
thy
beloved
may
be
delivered:
save
with
thy
right
hand,
and
answer
me.
108:007
God
hath
spoken
in
his
holiness;
I
will
rejoice,
I
will
divide
Shechem,
and
mete
out
the
valley
of
Succoth.
108:008
Gilead
is
mine;
Manasseh
is
mine;
Ephraim
also
is
the
strength
of
mine
head;
Judah
is
my
lawgiver;
108:009
Moab
is
my
washpot;
over
Edom
will
I
cast
out
my
shoe;
over
Philistia
will
I
triumph.
108:010
Who
will
bring
me
into
the
strong
city?
who
will
lead
me
into
Edom?
108:011
Wilt
not
thou,
O
God,
who
hast
cast
us
off?
and
wilt
not
thou,
O
God,
go
forth
with
our
hosts?
108:012
Give
us
help
from
trouble:
for
vain
is
the
help
of
man.
108:013
Through
God
we
shall
do
valiantly:
for
he
it
is
that
shall
tread
down
our
enemies.
109:001
Hold
not
thy
peace,
O
God
of
my
praise;
109:002
For
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
and
the
mouth
of
the
deceitful
are
opened
against
me:
they
have
spoken
against
me
with
a
lying
tongue.
109:003
They
compassed
me
about
also
with
words
of
hatred;
and
fought
against
me
without
a
cause.
109:004
For
my
love
they
are
my
adversaries:
but
I
give
myself
unto
prayer.
109:005
And
they
have
rewarded
me
evil
for
good,
and
hatred
for
my
love.
109:006
Set
thou
a
wicked
man
over
him:
and
let
Satan
stand
at
his
right
hand.
109:007
When
he
shall
be
judged,
let
him
be
condemned:
and
let
his
prayer
become
sin.
109:008
Let
his
days
be
few;
and
let
another
take
his
office.
109:009
Let
his
children
be
fatherless,
and
his
wife
a
widow.
109:010
Let
his
children
be
continually
vagabonds,
and
beg:
let
them
seek
their
bread
also
out
of
their
desolate
places.
109:011
Let
the
extortioner
catch
all
that
he
hath;
and
let
the
strangers
spoil
his
labour.
109:012
Let
there
be
none
to
extend
mercy
unto
him:
neither
let
there
be
any
to
favour
his
fatherless
children.
109:013
Let
his
posterity
be
cut
off;
and
in
the
generation
following
let
their
name
be
blotted
out.
109:014
Let
the
iniquity
of
his
fathers
be
remembered
with
the
LORD;
and
let
not
the
sin
of
his
mother
be
blotted
out.
109:015
Let
them
be
before
the
LORD
continually,
that
he
may
cut
off
the
memory
of
them
from
the
earth.
109:016
Because
that
he
remembered
not
to
shew
mercy,
but
persecuted
the
poor
and
needy
man,
that
he
might
even
slay
the
broken
in
heart.
109:017
As
he
loved
cursing,
so
let
it
come
unto
him:
as
he
delighted
not
in
blessing,
so
let
it
be
far
from
him.
109:018
As
he
clothed
himself
with
cursing
like
as
with
his
garment,
so
let
it
come
into
his
bowels
like
water,
and
like
oil
into
his
bones.
109:019
Let
it
be
unto
him
as
the
garment
which
covereth
him,
and
for
a
girdle
wherewith
he
is
girded
continually.
109:020
Let
this
be
the
reward
of
mine
adversaries
from
the
LORD,
and
of
them
that
speak
evil
against
my
soul.
109:021
But
do
thou
for
me,
O
GOD
the
Lord,
for
thy
name's
sake:
because
thy
mercy
is
good,
deliver
thou
me.
109:022
For
I
am
poor
and
needy,
and
my
heart
is
wounded
within
me.
109:023
I
am
gone
like
the
shadow
when
it
declineth:
I
am
tossed
up
and
down
as
the
locust.
109:024
My
knees
are
weak
through
fasting;
and
my
flesh
faileth
of
fatness.
109:025
I
became
also
a
reproach
unto
them:
when
they
looked
upon
me
they
shaked
their
heads.
109:026
Help
me,
O
LORD
my
God:
O
save
me
according
to
thy
mercy:
109:027
That
they
may
know
that
this
is
thy
hand;
that
thou,
LORD,
hast
done
it.
109:028
Let
them
curse,
but
bless
thou:
when
they
arise,
let
them
be
ashamed;
but
let
thy
servant
rejoice.
109:029
Let
mine
adversaries
be
clothed
with
shame,
and
let
them
cover
themselves
with
their
own
confusion,
as
with
a
mantle.
109:030
I
will
greatly
praise
the
LORD
with
my
mouth;
yea,
I
will
praise
him
among
the
multitude.
109:031
For
he
shall
stand
at
the
right
hand
of
the
poor,
to
save
him
from
those
that
condemn
his
soul.
110:001
The
LORD
said
unto
my
Lord,
Sit
thou
at
my
right
hand,
until
I
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool.
110:002
The
LORD
shall
send
the
rod
of
thy
strength
out
of
Zion:
rule
thou
in
the
midst
of
thine
enemies.
110:003
Thy
people
shall
be
willing
in
the
day
of
thy
power,
in
the
beauties
of
holiness
from
the
womb
of
the
morning:
thou
hast
the
dew
of
thy
youth.
110:004
The
LORD
hath
sworn,
and
will
not
repent,
Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchizedek.
110:005
The
Lord
at
thy
right
hand
shall
strike
through
kings
in
the
day
of
his
wrath.
110:006
He
shall
judge
among
the
heathen,
he
shall
fill
the
places
with
the
dead
bodies;
he
shall
wound
the
heads
over
many
countries.
110:007
He
shall
drink
of
the
brook
in
the
way:
therefore
shall
he
lift
up
the
head.
111:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
I
will
praise
the
LORD
with
my
whole
heart,
in
the
assembly
of
the
upright,
and
in
the
congregation.
111:002
The
works
of
the
LORD
are
great,
sought
out
of
all
them
that
have
pleasure
therein.
111:003
His
work
is
honourable
and
glorious:
and
his
righteousness
endureth
for
ever.
111:004
He
hath
made
his
wonderful
works
to
be
remembered:
the
LORD
is
gracious
and
full
of
compassion.
111:005
He
hath
given
meat
unto
them
that
fear
him:
he
will
ever
be
mindful
of
his
covenant.
111:006
He
hath
shewed
his
people
the
power
of
his
works,
that
he
may
give
them
the
heritage
of
the
heathen.
111:007
The
works
of
his
hands
are
verity
and
judgment;
all
his
commandments
are
sure.
111:008
They
stand
fast
for
ever
and
ever,
and
are
done
in
truth
and
uprightness.
111:009
He
sent
redemption
unto
his
people:
he
hath
commanded
his
covenant
for
ever:
holy
and
reverend
is
his
name.
111:010
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom:
a
good
understanding
have
all
they
that
do
his
commandments:
his
praise
endureth
for
ever.
112:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
Blessed
is
the
man
that
feareth
the
LORD,
that
delighteth
greatly
in
his
commandments.
112:002
His
seed
shall
be
mighty
upon
earth:
the
generation
of
the
upright
shall
be
blessed.
112:003
Wealth
and
riches
shall
be
in
his
house:
and
his
righteousness
endureth
for
ever.
112:004
Unto
the
upright
there
ariseth
light
in
the
darkness:
he
is
gracious,
and
full
of
compassion,
and
righteous.
112:005
A
good
man
sheweth
favour,
and
lendeth:
he
will
guide
his
affairs
with
discretion.
112:006
Surely
he
shall
not
be
moved
for
ever:
the
righteous
shall
be
in
everlasting
remembrance.
112:007
He
shall
not
be
afraid
of
evil
tidings:
his
heart
is
fixed,
trusting
in
the
LORD.
112:008
His
heart
is
established,
he
shall
not
be
afraid,
until
he
see
his
desire
upon
his
enemies.
112:009
He
hath
dispersed,
he
hath
given
to
the
poor;
his
righteousness
endureth
for
ever;
his
horn
shall
be
exalted
with
honour.
112:010
The
wicked
shall
see
it,
and
be
grieved;
he
shall
gnash
with
his
teeth,
and
melt
away:
the
desire
of
the
wicked
shall
perish.
113:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
Praise,
O
ye
servants
of
the
LORD,
praise
the
name
of
the
LORD.
113:002
Blessed
be
the
name
of
the
LORD
from
this
time
forth
and
for
evermore.
113:003
From
the
rising
of
the
sun
unto
the
going
down
of
the
same
the
LORD's
name
is
to
be
praised.
113:004
The
LORD
is
high
above
all
nations,
and
his
glory
above
the
heavens.
113:005
Who
is
like
unto
the
LORD
our
God,
who
dwelleth
on
high,
113:006
Who
humbleth
himself
to
behold
the
things
that
are
in
heaven,
and
in
the
earth!
113:007
He
raiseth
up
the
poor
out
of
the
dust,
and
lifteth
the
needy
out
of
the
dunghill;
113:008
That
he
may
set
him
with
princes,
even
with
the
princes
of
his
people.
113:009
He
maketh
the
barren
woman
to
keep
house,
and
to
be
a
joyful
mother
of
children.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
114:001
When
Israel
went
out
of
Egypt,
the
house
of
Jacob
from
a
people
of
strange
language;
114:002
Judah
was
his
sanctuary,
and
Israel
his
dominion.
114:003
The
sea
saw
it,
and
fled:
Jordan
was
driven
back.
114:004
The
mountains
skipped
like
rams,
and
the
little
hills
like
lambs.
114:005
What
ailed
thee,
O
thou
sea,
that
thou
fleddest?
thou
Jordan,
that
thou
wast
driven
back?
114:006
Ye
mountains,
that
ye
skipped
like
rams;
and
ye
little
hills,
like
lambs?
114:007
Tremble,
thou
earth,
at
the
presence
of
the
Lord,
at
the
presence
of
the
God
of
Jacob;
114:008
Which
turned
the
rock
into
a
standing
water,
the
flint
into
a
fountain
of
waters.
115:001
Not
unto
us,
O
LORD,
not
unto
us,
but
unto
thy
name
give
glory,
for
thy
mercy,
and
for
thy
truth's
sake.
115:002
Wherefore
should
the
heathen
say,
Where
is
now
their
God?
115:003
But
our
God
is
in
the
heavens:
he
hath
done
whatsoever
he
hath
pleased.
115:004
Their
idols
are
silver
and
gold,
the
work
of
men's
hands.
115:005
They
have
mouths,
but
they
speak
not:
eyes
have
they,
but
they
see
not:
115:006
They
have
ears,
but
they
hear
not:
noses
have
they,
but
they
smell
not:
115:007
They
have
hands,
but
they
handle
not:
feet
have
they,
but
they
walk
not:
neither
speak
they
through
their
throat.
115:008
They
that
make
them
are
like
unto
them;
so
is
every
one
that
trusteth
in
them.
115:009
O
Israel,
trust
thou
in
the
LORD:
he
is
their
help
and
their
shield.
115:010
O
house
of
Aaron,
trust
in
the
LORD:
he
is
their
help
and
their
shield.
115:011
Ye
that
fear
the
LORD,
trust
in
the
LORD:
he
is
their
help
and
their
shield.
115:012
The
LORD
hath
been
mindful
of
us:
he
will
bless
us;
he
will
bless
the
house
of
Israel;
he
will
bless
the
house
of
Aaron.
115:013
He
will
bless
them
that
fear
the
LORD,
both
small
and
great.
115:014
The
LORD
shall
increase
you
more
and
more,
you
and
your
children.
115:015
Ye
are
blessed
of
the
LORD
which
made
heaven
and
earth.
115:016
The
heaven,
even
the
heavens,
are
the
LORD's:
but
the
earth
hath
he
given
to
the
children
of
men.
115:017
The
dead
praise
not
the
LORD,
neither
any
that
go
down
into
silence.
115:018
But
we
will
bless
the
LORD
from
this
time
forth
and
for
evermore.
Praise
the
LORD.
116:001
I
love
the
LORD,
because
he
hath
heard
my
voice
and
my
supplications.
116:002
Because
he
hath
inclined
his
ear
unto
me,
therefore
will
I
call
upon
him
as
long
as
I
live.
116:003
The
sorrows
of
death
compassed
me,
and
the
pains
of
hell
gat
hold
upon
me:
I
found
trouble
and
sorrow.
116:004
Then
called
I
upon
the
name
of
the
LORD;
O
LORD,
I
beseech
thee,
deliver
my
soul.
116:005
Gracious
is
the
LORD,
and
righteous;
yea,
our
God
is
merciful.
116:006
The
LORD
preserveth
the
simple:
I
was
brought
low,
and
he
helped
me.
116:007
Return
unto
thy
rest,
O
my
soul;
for
the
LORD
hath
dealt
bountifully
with
thee.
116:008
For
thou
hast
delivered
my
soul
from
death,
mine
eyes
from
tears,
and
my
feet
from
falling.
116:009
I
will
walk
before
the
LORD
in
the
land
of
the
living.
116:010
I
believed,
therefore
have
I
spoken:
I
was
greatly
afflicted:
116:011
I
said
in
my
haste,
All
men
are
liars.
116:012
What
shall
I
render
unto
the
LORD
for
all
his
benefits
toward
me?
116:013
I
will
take
the
cup
of
salvation,
and
call
upon
the
name
of
the
LORD.
116:014
I
will
pay
my
vows
unto
the
LORD
now
in
the
presence
of
all
his
people.
116:015
Precious
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
is
the
death
of
his
saints.
116:016
O
LORD,
truly
I
am
thy
servant;
I
am
thy
servant,
and
the
son
of
thine
handmaid:
thou
hast
loosed
my
bonds.
116:017
I
will
offer
to
thee
the
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving,
and
will
call
upon
the
name
of
the
LORD.
116:018
I
will
pay
my
vows
unto
the
LORD
now
in
the
presence
of
all
his
people.
116:019
In
the
courts
of
the
LORD's
house,
in
the
midst
of
thee,
O
Jerusalem.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
117:001
O
praise
the
LORD,
all
ye
nations:
praise
him,
all
ye
people.
117:002
For
his
merciful
kindness
is
great
toward
us:
and
the
truth
of
the
LORD
endureth
for
ever.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
118:001
O
give
thanks
unto
the
LORD;
for
he
is
good:
because
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
118:002
Let
Israel
now
say,
that
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
118:003
Let
the
house
of
Aaron
now
say,
that
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
118:004
Let
them
now
that
fear
the
LORD
say,
that
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
118:005
I
called
upon
the
LORD
in
distress:
the
LORD
answered
me,
and
set
me
in
a
large
place.
118:006
The
LORD
is
on
my
side;
I
will
not
fear:
what
can
man
do
unto
me?
118:007
The
LORD
taketh
my
part
with
them
that
help
me:
therefore
shall
I
see
my
desire
upon
them
that
hate
me.
118:008
It
is
better
to
trust
in
the
LORD
than
to
put
confidence
in
man.
118:009
It
is
better
to
trust
in
the
LORD
than
to
put
confidence
in
princes.
118:010
All
nations
compassed
me
about:
but
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
will
I
destroy
them.
118:011
They
compassed
me
about;
yea,
they
compassed
me
about:
but
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
I
will
destroy
them.
118:012
They
compassed
me
about
like
bees:
they
are
quenched
as
the
fire
of
thorns:
for
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
I
will
destroy
them.
118:013
Thou
hast
thrust
sore
at
me
that
I
might
fall:
but
the
LORD
helped
me.
118:014
The
LORD
is
my
strength
and
song,
and
is
become
my
salvation.
118:015
The
voice
of
rejoicing
and
salvation
is
in
the
tabernacles
of
the
righteous:
the
right
hand
of
the
LORD
doeth
valiantly.
118:016
The
right
hand
of
the
LORD
is
exalted:
the
right
hand
of
the
LORD
doeth
valiantly.
118:017
I
shall
not
die,
but
live,
and
declare
the
works
of
the
LORD.
118:018
The
LORD
hath
chastened
me
sore:
but
he
hath
not
given
me
over
unto
death.
118:019
Open
to
me
the
gates
of
righteousness:
I
will
go
into
them,
and
I
will
praise
the
LORD:
118:020
This
gate
of
the
LORD,
into
which
the
righteous
shall
enter.
118:021
I
will
praise
thee:
for
thou
hast
heard
me,
and
art
become
my
salvation.
118:022
The
stone
which
the
builders
refused
is
become
the
head
stone
of
the
corner.
118:023
This
is
the
LORD's
doing;
it
is
marvellous
in
our
eyes.
118:024
This
is
the
day
which
the
LORD
hath
made;
we
will
rejoice
and
be
glad
in
it.
118:025
Save
now,
I
beseech
thee,
O
LORD:
O
LORD,
I
beseech
thee,
send
now
prosperity.
118:026
Blessed
be
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
LORD:
we
have
blessed
you
out
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
118:027
God
is
the
LORD,
which
hath
shewed
us
light:
bind
the
sacrifice
with
cords,
even
unto
the
horns
of
the
altar.
118:028
Thou
art
my
God,
and
I
will
praise
thee:
thou
art
my
God,
I
will
exalt
thee.
118:029
O
give
thanks
unto
the
LORD;
for
he
is
good:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
119:001
Blessed
are
the
undefiled
in
the
way,
who
walk
in
the
law
of
the
LORD.
119:002
Blessed
are
they
that
keep
his
testimonies,
and
that
seek
him
with
the
whole
heart.
119:003
They
also
do
no
iniquity:
they
walk
in
his
ways.
119:004
Thou
hast
commanded
us
to
keep
thy
precepts
diligently.
119:005
O
that
my
ways
were
directed
to
keep
thy
statutes!
119:006
Then
shall
I
not
be
ashamed,
when
I
have
respect
unto
all
thy
commandments.
119:007
I
will
praise
thee
with
uprightness
of
heart,
when
I
shall
have
learned
thy
righteous
judgments.
119:008
I
will
keep
thy
statutes:
O
forsake
me
not
utterly.
119:009
Wherewithal
shall
a
young
man
cleanse
his
way?
by
taking
heed
thereto
according
to
thy
word.
119:010
With
my
whole
heart
have
I
sought
thee:
O
let
me
not
wander
from
thy
commandments.
119:011
Thy
word
have
I
hid
in
mine
heart,
that
I
might
not
sin
against
thee.
119:012
Blessed
art
thou,
O
LORD:
teach
me
thy
statutes.
119:013
With
my
lips
have
I
declared
all
the
judgments
of
thy
mouth.
119:014
I
have
rejoiced
in
the
way
of
thy
testimonies,
as
much
as
in
all
riches.
119:015
I
will
meditate
in
thy
precepts,
and
have
respect
unto
thy
ways.
119:016
I
will
delight
myself
in
thy
statutes:
I
will
not
forget
thy
word.
119:017
Deal
bountifully
with
thy
servant,
that
I
may
live,
and
keep
thy
word.
