119:018
Open
thou
mine
eyes,
that
I
may
behold
wondrous
things
out
of
thy
law.
119:019
I
am
a
stranger
in
the
earth:
hide
not
thy
commandments
from
me.
119:020
My
soul
breaketh
for
the
longing
that
it
hath
unto
thy
judgments
at
all
times.
119:021
Thou
hast
rebuked
the
proud
that
are
cursed,
which
do
err
from
thy
commandments.
119:022
Remove
from
me
reproach
and
contempt;
for
I
have
kept
thy
testimonies.
119:023
Princes
also
did
sit
and
speak
against
me:
but
thy
servant
did
meditate
in
thy
statutes.
119:024
Thy
testimonies
also
are
my
delight
and
my
counsellors.
119:025
My
soul
cleaveth
unto
the
dust:
quicken
thou
me
according
to
thy
word.
119:026
I
have
declared
my
ways,
and
thou
heardest
me:
teach
me
thy
statutes.
119:027
Make
me
to
understand
the
way
of
thy
precepts:
so
shall
I
talk
of
thy
wondrous
works.
119:028
My
soul
melteth
for
heaviness:
strengthen
thou
me
according
unto
thy
word.
119:029
Remove
from
me
the
way
of
lying:
and
grant
me
thy
law
graciously.
119:030
I
have
chosen
the
way
of
truth:
thy
judgments
have
I
laid
before
me.
119:031
I
have
stuck
unto
thy
testimonies:
O
LORD,
put
me
not
to
shame.
119:032
I
will
run
the
way
of
thy
commandments,
when
thou
shalt
enlarge
my
heart.
119:033
Teach
me,
O
LORD,
the
way
of
thy
statutes;
and
I
shall
keep
it
unto
the
end.
119:034
Give
me
understanding,
and
I
shall
keep
thy
law;
yea,
I
shall
observe
it
with
my
whole
heart.
119:035
Make
me
to
go
in
the
path
of
thy
commandments;
for
therein
do
I
delight.
119:036
Incline
my
heart
unto
thy
testimonies,
and
not
to
covetousness.
119:037
Turn
away
mine
eyes
from
beholding
vanity;
and
quicken
thou
me
in
thy
way.
119:038
Stablish
thy
word
unto
thy
servant,
who
is
devoted
to
thy
fear.
119:039
Turn
away
my
reproach
which
I
fear:
for
thy
judgments
are
good.
119:040
Behold,
I
have
longed
after
thy
precepts:
quicken
me
in
thy
righteousness.
119:041
Let
thy
mercies
come
also
unto
me,
O
LORD,
even
thy
salvation,
according
to
thy
word.
119:042
So
shall
I
have
wherewith
to
answer
him
that
reproacheth
me:
for
I
trust
in
thy
word.
119:043
And
take
not
the
word
of
truth
utterly
out
of
my
mouth;
for
I
have
hoped
in
thy
judgments.
119:044
So
shall
I
keep
thy
law
continually
for
ever
and
ever.
119:045
And
I
will
walk
at
liberty:
for
I
seek
thy
precepts.
119:046
I
will
speak
of
thy
testimonies
also
before
kings,
and
will
not
be
ashamed.
119:047
And
I
will
delight
myself
in
thy
commandments,
which
I
have
loved.
119:048
My
hands
also
will
I
lift
up
unto
thy
commandments,
which
I
have
loved;
and
I
will
meditate
in
thy
statutes.
119:049
Remember
the
word
unto
thy
servant,
upon
which
thou
hast
caused
me
to
hope.
119:050
This
is
my
comfort
in
my
affliction:
for
thy
word
hath
quickened
me.
119:051
The
proud
have
had
me
greatly
in
derision:
yet
have
I
not
declined
from
thy
law.
119:052
I
remembered
thy
judgments
of
old,
O
LORD;
and
have
comforted
myself.
119:053
Horror
hath
taken
hold
upon
me
because
of
the
wicked
that
forsake
thy
law.
119:054
Thy
statutes
have
been
my
songs
in
the
house
of
my
pilgrimage.
119:055
I
have
remembered
thy
name,
O
LORD,
in
the
night,
and
have
kept
thy
law.
119:056
This
I
had,
because
I
kept
thy
precepts.
119:057
Thou
art
my
portion,
O
LORD:
I
have
said
that
I
would
keep
thy
words.
119:058
I
intreated
thy
favour
with
my
whole
heart:
be
merciful
unto
me
according
to
thy
word.
119:059
I
thought
on
my
ways,
and
turned
my
feet
unto
thy
testimonies.
119:060
I
made
haste,
and
delayed
not
to
keep
thy
commandments.
119:061
The
bands
of
the
wicked
have
robbed
me:
but
I
have
not
forgotten
thy
law.
119:062
At
midnight
I
will
rise
to
give
thanks
unto
thee
because
of
thy
righteous
judgments.
119:063
I
am
a
companion
of
all
them
that
fear
thee,
and
of
them
that
keep
thy
precepts.
119:064
The
earth,
O
LORD,
is
full
of
thy
mercy:
teach
me
thy
statutes.
119:065
Thou
hast
dealt
well
with
thy
servant,
O
LORD,
according
unto
thy
word.
119:066
Teach
me
good
judgment
and
knowledge:
for
I
have
believed
thy
commandments.
119:067
Before
I
was
afflicted
I
went
astray:
but
now
have
I
kept
thy
word.
119:068
Thou
art
good,
and
doest
good;
teach
me
thy
statutes.
119:069
The
proud
have
forged
a
lie
against
me:
but
I
will
keep
thy
precepts
with
my
whole
heart.
119:070
Their
heart
is
as
fat
as
grease;
but
I
delight
in
thy
law.
119:071
It
is
good
for
me
that
I
have
been
afflicted;
that
I
might
learn
thy
statutes.
119:072
The
law
of
thy
mouth
is
better
unto
me
than
thousands
of
gold
and
silver.
119:073
Thy
hands
have
made
me
and
fashioned
me:
give
me
understanding,
that
I
may
learn
thy
commandments.
119:074
They
that
fear
thee
will
be
glad
when
they
see
me;
because
I
have
hoped
in
thy
word.
119:075
I
know,
O
LORD,
that
thy
judgments
are
right,
and
that
thou
in
faithfulness
hast
afflicted
me.
119:076
Let,
I
pray
thee,
thy
merciful
kindness
be
for
my
comfort,
according
to
thy
word
unto
thy
servant.
119:077
Let
thy
tender
mercies
come
unto
me,
that
I
may
live:
for
thy
law
is
my
delight.
119:078
Let
the
proud
be
ashamed;
for
they
dealt
perversely
with
me
without
a
cause:
but
I
will
meditate
in
thy
precepts.
119:079
Let
those
that
fear
thee
turn
unto
me,
and
those
that
have
known
thy
testimonies.
119:080
Let
my
heart
be
sound
in
thy
statutes;
that
I
be
not
ashamed.
119:081
My
soul
fainteth
for
thy
salvation:
but
I
hope
in
thy
word.
119:082
Mine
eyes
fail
for
thy
word,
saying,
When
wilt
thou
comfort
me?
119:083
For
I
am
become
like
a
bottle
in
the
smoke;
yet
do
I
not
forget
thy
statutes.
119:084
How
many
are
the
days
of
thy
servant?
when
wilt
thou
execute
judgment
on
them
that
persecute
me?
119:085
The
proud
have
digged
pits
for
me,
which
are
not
after
thy
law.
119:086
All
thy
commandments
are
faithful:
they
persecute
me
wrongfully;
help
thou
me.
119:087
They
had
almost
consumed
me
upon
earth;
but
I
forsook
not
thy
precepts.
119:088
Quicken
me
after
thy
lovingkindness;
so
shall
I
keep
the
testimony
of
thy
mouth.
119:089
For
ever,
O
LORD,
thy
word
is
settled
in
heaven.
119:090
Thy
faithfulness
is
unto
all
generations:
thou
hast
established
the
earth,
and
it
abideth.
119:091
They
continue
this
day
according
to
thine
ordinances:
for
all
are
thy
servants.
119:092
Unless
thy
law
had
been
my
delights,
I
should
then
have
perished
in
mine
affliction.
119:093
I
will
never
forget
thy
precepts:
for
with
them
thou
hast
quickened
me.
119:094
I
am
thine,
save
me:
for
I
have
sought
thy
precepts.
119:095
The
wicked
have
waited
for
me
to
destroy
me:
but
I
will
consider
thy
testimonies.
119:096
I
have
seen
an
end
of
all
perfection:
but
thy
commandment
is
exceeding
broad.
119:097
O
how
I
love
thy
law!
it
is
my
meditation
all
the
day.
119:098
Thou
through
thy
commandments
hast
made
me
wiser
than
mine
enemies:
for
they
are
ever
with
me.
119:099
I
have
more
understanding
than
all
my
teachers:
for
thy
testimonies
are
my
meditation.
119:100
I
understand
more
than
the
ancients,
because
I
keep
thy
precepts.
119:101
I
have
refrained
my
feet
from
every
evil
way,
that
I
might
keep
thy
word.
119:102
I
have
not
departed
from
thy
judgments:
for
thou
hast
taught
me.
119:103
How
sweet
are
thy
words
unto
my
taste!
yea,
sweeter
than
honey
to
my
mouth!
119:104
Through
thy
precepts
I
get
understanding:
therefore
I
hate
every
false
way.
119:105
Thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
feet,
and
a
light
unto
my
path.
119:106
I
have
sworn,
and
I
will
perform
it,
that
I
will
keep
thy
righteous
judgments.
119:107
I
am
afflicted
very
much:
quicken
me,
O
LORD,
according
unto
thy
word.
119:108
Accept,
I
beseech
thee,
the
freewill
offerings
of
my
mouth,
O
LORD,
and
teach
me
thy
judgments.
119:109
My
soul
is
continually
in
my
hand:
yet
do
I
not
forget
thy
law.
119:110
The
wicked
have
laid
a
snare
for
me:
yet
I
erred
not
from
thy
precepts.
119:111
Thy
testimonies
have
I
taken
as
an
heritage
for
ever:
for
they
are
the
rejoicing
of
my
heart.
119:112
I
have
inclined
mine
heart
to
perform
thy
statutes
alway,
even
unto
the
end.
119:113
I
hate
vain
thoughts:
but
thy
law
do
I
love.
119:114
Thou
art
my
hiding
place
and
my
shield:
I
hope
in
thy
word.
119:115
Depart
from
me,
ye
evildoers:
for
I
will
keep
the
commandments
of
my
God.
119:116
Uphold
me
according
unto
thy
word,
that
I
may
live:
and
let
me
not
be
ashamed
of
my
hope.
119:117
Hold
thou
me
up,
and
I
shall
be
safe:
and
I
will
have
respect
unto
thy
statutes
continually.
119:118
Thou
hast
trodden
down
all
them
that
err
from
thy
statutes:
for
their
deceit
is
falsehood.
119:119
Thou
puttest
away
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
like
dross:
therefore
I
love
thy
testimonies.
119:120
My
flesh
trembleth
for
fear
of
thee;
and
I
am
afraid
of
thy
judgments.
119:121
I
have
done
judgment
and
justice:
leave
me
not
to
mine
oppressors.
119:122
Be
surety
for
thy
servant
for
good:
let
not
the
proud
oppress
me.
119:123
Mine
eyes
fail
for
thy
salvation,
and
for
the
word
of
thy
righteousness.
119:124
Deal
with
thy
servant
according
unto
thy
mercy,
and
teach
me
thy
statutes.
119:125
I
am
thy
servant;
give
me
understanding,
that
I
may
know
thy
testimonies.
119:126
It
is
time
for
thee,
LORD,
to
work:
for
they
have
made
void
thy
law.
119:127
Therefore
I
love
thy
commandments
above
gold;
yea,
above
fine
gold.
119:128
Therefore
I
esteem
all
thy
precepts
concerning
all
things
to
be
right;
and
I
hate
every
false
way.
119:129
Thy
testimonies
are
wonderful:
therefore
doth
my
soul
keep
them.
119:130
The
entrance
of
thy
words
giveth
light;
it
giveth
understanding
unto
the
simple.
119:131
I
opened
my
mouth,
and
panted:
for
I
longed
for
thy
commandments.
119:132
Look
thou
upon
me,
and
be
merciful
unto
me,
as
thou
usest
to
do
unto
those
that
love
thy
name.
119:133
Order
my
steps
in
thy
word:
and
let
not
any
iniquity
have
dominion
over
me.
119:134
Deliver
me
from
the
oppression
of
man:
so
will
I
keep
thy
precepts.
119:135
Make
thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
servant;
and
teach
me
thy
statutes.
119:136
Rivers
of
waters
run
down
mine
eyes,
because
they
keep
not
thy
law.
119:137
Righteous
art
thou,
O
LORD,
and
upright
are
thy
judgments.
119:138
Thy
testimonies
that
thou
hast
commanded
are
righteous
and
very
faithful.
119:139
My
zeal
hath
consumed
me,
because
mine
enemies
have
forgotten
thy
words.
119:140
Thy
word
is
very
pure:
therefore
thy
servant
loveth
it.
119:141
I
am
small
and
despised:
yet
do
not
I
forget
thy
precepts.
119:142
Thy
righteousness
is
an
everlasting
righteousness,
and
thy
law
is
the
truth.
119:143
Trouble
and
anguish
have
taken
hold
on
me:
yet
thy
commandments
are
my
delights.
119:144
The
righteousness
of
thy
testimonies
is
everlasting:
give
me
understanding,
and
I
shall
live.
119:145
I
cried
with
my
whole
heart;
hear
me,
O
LORD:
I
will
keep
thy
statutes.
119:146
I
cried
unto
thee;
save
me,
and
I
shall
keep
thy
testimonies.
119:147
I
prevented
the
dawning
of
the
morning,
and
cried:
I
hoped
in
thy
word.
119:148
Mine
eyes
prevent
the
night
watches,
that
I
might
meditate
in
thy
word.
119:149
Hear
my
voice
according
unto
thy
lovingkindness:
O
LORD,
quicken
me
according
to
thy
judgment.
119:150
They
draw
nigh
that
follow
after
mischief:
they
are
far
from
thy
law.
119:151
Thou
art
near,
O
LORD;
and
all
thy
commandments
are
truth.
119:152
Concerning
thy
testimonies,
I
have
known
of
old
that
thou
hast
founded
them
for
ever.
119:153
Consider
mine
affliction,
and
deliver
me:
for
I
do
not
forget
thy
law.
119:154
Plead
my
cause,
and
deliver
me:
quicken
me
according
to
thy
word.
119:155
Salvation
is
far
from
the
wicked:
for
they
seek
not
thy
statutes.
119:156
Great
are
thy
tender
mercies,
O
LORD:
quicken
me
according
to
thy
judgments.
119:157
Many
are
my
persecutors
and
mine
enemies;
yet
do
I
not
decline
from
thy
testimonies.
119:158
I
beheld
the
transgressors,
and
was
grieved;
because
they
kept
not
thy
word.
119:159
Consider
how
I
love
thy
precepts:
quicken
me,
O
LORD,
according
to
thy
lovingkindness.
119:160
Thy
word
is
true
from
the
beginning:
and
every
one
of
thy
righteous
judgments
endureth
for
ever.
119:161
Princes
have
persecuted
me
without
a
cause:
but
my
heart
standeth
in
awe
of
thy
word.
119:162
I
rejoice
at
thy
word,
as
one
that
findeth
great
spoil.
119:163
I
hate
and
abhor
lying:
but
thy
law
do
I
love.
119:164
Seven
times
a
day
do
I
praise
thee
because
of
thy
righteous
judgments.
119:165
Great
peace
have
they
which
love
thy
law:
and
nothing
shall
offend
them.
119:166
LORD,
I
have
hoped
for
thy
salvation,
and
done
thy
commandments.
119:167
My
soul
hath
kept
thy
testimonies;
and
I
love
them
exceedingly.
119:168
I
have
kept
thy
precepts
and
thy
testimonies:
for
all
my
ways
are
before
thee.
119:169
Let
my
cry
come
near
before
thee,
O
LORD:
give
me
understanding
according
to
thy
word.
119:170
Let
my
supplication
come
before
thee:
deliver
me
according
to
thy
word.
119:171
My
lips
shall
utter
praise,
when
thou
hast
taught
me
thy
statutes.
119:172
My
tongue
shall
speak
of
thy
word:
for
all
thy
commandments
are
righteousness.
119:173
Let
thine
hand
help
me;
for
I
have
chosen
thy
precepts.
119:174
I
have
longed
for
thy
salvation,
O
LORD;
and
thy
law
is
my
delight.
119:175
Let
my
soul
live,
and
it
shall
praise
thee;
and
let
thy
judgments
help
me.
119:176
I
have
gone
astray
like
a
lost
sheep;
seek
thy
servant;
for
I
do
not
forget
thy
commandments.
120:001
In
my
distress
I
cried
unto
the
LORD,
and
he
heard
me.
120:002
Deliver
my
soul,
O
LORD,
from
lying
lips,
and
from
a
deceitful
tongue.
120:003
What
shall
be
given
unto
thee?
or
what
shall
be
done
unto
thee,
thou
false
tongue?
120:004
Sharp
arrows
of
the
mighty,
with
coals
of
juniper.
120:005
Woe
is
me,
that
I
sojourn
in
Mesech,
that
I
dwell
in
the
tents
of
Kedar!
120:006
My
soul
hath
long
dwelt
with
him
that
hateth
peace.
120:007
I
am
for
peace:
but
when
I
speak,
they
are
for
war.
121:001
I
will
lift
up
mine
eyes
unto
the
hills,
from
whence
cometh
my
help.
121:002
My
help
cometh
from
the
LORD,
which
made
heaven
and
earth.
121:003
He
will
not
suffer
thy
foot
to
be
moved:
he
that
keepeth
thee
will
not
slumber.
121:004
Behold,
he
that
keepeth
Israel
shall
neither
slumber
nor
sleep.
121:005
The
LORD
is
thy
keeper:
the
LORD
is
thy
shade
upon
thy
right
hand.
121:006
The
sun
shall
not
smite
thee
by
day,
nor
the
moon
by
night.
121:007
The
LORD
shall
preserve
thee
from
all
evil:
he
shall
preserve
thy
soul.
121:008
The
LORD
shall
preserve
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
from
this
time
forth,
and
even
for
evermore.
122:001
I
was
glad
when
they
said
unto
me,
Let
us
go
into
the
house
of
the
LORD.
122:002
Our
feet
shall
stand
within
thy
gates,
O
Jerusalem.
122:003
Jerusalem
is
builded
as
a
city
that
is
compact
together:
122:004
Whither
the
tribes
go
up,
the
tribes
of
the
LORD,
unto
the
testimony
of
Israel,
to
give
thanks
unto
the
name
of
the
LORD.
122:005
For
there
are
set
thrones
of
judgment,
the
thrones
of
the
house
of
David.
122:006
Pray
for
the
peace
of
Jerusalem:
they
shall
prosper
that
love
thee.
122:007
Peace
be
within
thy
walls,
and
prosperity
within
thy
palaces.
122:008
For
my
brethren
and
companions'
sakes,
I
will
now
say,
Peace
be
within
thee.
122:009
Because
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
our
God
I
will
seek
thy
good.
123:001
Unto
thee
lift
I
up
mine
eyes,
O
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
heavens.
123:002
Behold,
as
the
eyes
of
servants
look
unto
the
hand
of
their
masters,
and
as
the
eyes
of
a
maiden
unto
the
hand
of
her
mistress;
so
our
eyes
wait
upon
the
LORD
our
God,
until
that
he
have
mercy
upon
us.
123:003
Have
mercy
upon
us,
O
LORD,
have
mercy
upon
us:
for
we
are
exceedingly
filled
with
contempt.
123:004
Our
soul
is
exceedingly
filled
with
the
scorning
of
those
that
are
at
ease,
and
with
the
contempt
of
the
proud.
124:001
If
it
had
not
been
the
LORD
who
was
on
our
side,
now
may
Israel
say;
124:002
If
it
had
not
been
the
LORD
who
was
on
our
side,
when
men
rose
up
against
us:
124:003
Then
they
had
swallowed
us
up
quick,
when
their
wrath
was
kindled
against
us:
124:004
Then
the
waters
had
overwhelmed
us,
the
stream
had
gone
over
our
soul:
124:005
Then
the
proud
waters
had
gone
over
our
soul.
124:006
Blessed
be
the
LORD,
who
hath
not
given
us
as
a
prey
to
their
teeth.
124:007
Our
soul
is
escaped
as
a
bird
out
of
the
snare
of
the
fowlers:
the
snare
is
broken,
and
we
are
escaped.
124:008
Our
help
is
in
the
name
of
the
LORD,
who
made
heaven
and
earth.
125:001
They
that
trust
in
the
LORD
shall
be
as
mount
Zion,
which
cannot
be
removed,
but
abideth
for
ever.
125:002
As
the
mountains
are
round
about
Jerusalem,
so
the
LORD
is
round
about
his
people
from
henceforth
even
for
ever.
125:003
For
the
rod
of
the
wicked
shall
not
rest
upon
the
lot
of
the
righteous;
lest
the
righteous
put
forth
their
hands
unto
iniquity.
125:004
Do
good,
O
LORD,
unto
those
that
be
good,
and
to
them
that
are
upright
in
their
hearts.
125:005
As
for
such
as
turn
aside
unto
their
crooked
ways,
the
LORD
shall
lead
them
forth
with
the
workers
of
iniquity:
but
peace
shall
be
upon
Israel.
126:001
When
the
LORD
turned
again
the
captivity
of
Zion,
we
were
like
them
that
dream.
126:002
Then
was
our
mouth
filled
with
laughter,
and
our
tongue
with
singing:
then
said
they
among
the
heathen,
The
LORD
hath
done
great
things
for
them.
126:003
The
LORD
hath
done
great
things
for
us;
whereof
we
are
glad.
126:004
Turn
again
our
captivity,
O
LORD,
as
the
streams
in
the
south.
126:005
They
that
sow
in
tears
shall
reap
in
joy.
126:006
He
that
goeth
forth
and
weepeth,
bearing
precious
seed,
shall
doubtless
come
again
with
rejoicing,
bringing
his
sheaves
with
him.
127:001
Except
the
LORD
build
the
house,
they
labour
in
vain
that
build
it:
except
the
LORD
keep
the
city,
the
watchman
waketh
but
in
vain.
127:002
It
is
vain
for
you
to
rise
up
early,
to
sit
up
late,
to
eat
the
bread
of
sorrows:
for
so
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep.
127:003
Lo,
children
are
an
heritage
of
the
LORD:
and
the
fruit
of
the
womb
is
his
reward.
127:004
As
arrows
are
in
the
hand
of
a
mighty
man;
so
are
children
of
the
youth.
127:005
Happy
is
the
man
that
hath
his
quiver
full
of
them:
they
shall
not
be
ashamed,
but
they
shall
speak
with
the
enemies
in
the
gate.
128:001
Blessed
is
every
one
that
feareth
the
LORD;
that
walketh
in
his
ways.
128:002
For
thou
shalt
eat
the
labour
of
thine
hands:
happy
shalt
thou
be,
and
it
shall
be
well
with
thee.
128:003
Thy
wife
shall
be
as
a
fruitful
vine
by
the
sides
of
thine
house:
thy
children
like
olive
plants
round
about
thy
table.
128:004
Behold,
that
thus
shall
the
man
be
blessed
that
feareth
the
LORD.
128:005
The
LORD
shall
bless
thee
out
of
Zion:
and
thou
shalt
see
the
good
of
Jerusalem
all
the
days
of
thy
life.
128:006
Yea,
thou
shalt
see
thy
children's
children,
and
peace
upon
Israel.
129:001
Many
a
time
have
they
afflicted
me
from
my
youth,
may
Israel
now
say:
129:002
Many
a
time
have
they
afflicted
me
from
my
youth:
yet
they
have
not
prevailed
against
me.
129:003
The
plowers
plowed
upon
my
back:
they
made
long
their
furrows.
129:004
The
LORD
is
righteous:
he
hath
cut
asunder
the
cords
of
the
wicked.
129:005
Let
them
all
be
confounded
and
turned
back
that
hate
Zion.
129:006
Let
them
be
as
the
grass
upon
the
housetops,
which
withereth
afore
it
groweth
up:
129:007
Wherewith
the
mower
filleth
not
his
hand;
nor
he
that
bindeth
sheaves
his
bosom.
129:008
Neither
do
they
which
go
by
say,
The
blessing
of
the
LORD
be
upon
you:
we
bless
you
in
the
name
of
the
LORD.
130:001
Out
of
the
depths
have
I
cried
unto
thee,
O
LORD.
130:002
Lord,
hear
my
voice:
let
thine
ears
be
attentive
to
the
voice
of
my
supplications.
130:003
If
thou,
LORD,
shouldest
mark
iniquities,
O
Lord,
who
shall
stand?
130:004
But
there
is
forgiveness
with
thee,
that
thou
mayest
be
feared.
130:005
I
wait
for
the
LORD,
my
soul
doth
wait,
and
in
his
word
do
I
hope.
130:006
My
soul
waiteth
for
the
Lord
more
than
they
that
watch
for
the
morning:
I
say,
more
than
they
that
watch
for
the
morning.
130:007
Let
Israel
hope
in
the
LORD:
for
with
the
LORD
there
is
mercy,
and
with
him
is
plenteous
redemption.
130:008
And
he
shall
redeem
Israel
from
all
his
iniquities.
131:001
Lord,
my
heart
is
not
haughty,
nor
mine
eyes
lofty:
neither
do
I
exercise
myself
in
great
matters,
or
in
things
too
high
for
me.
131:002
Surely
I
have
behaved
and
quieted
myself,
as
a
child
that
is
weaned
of
his
mother:
my
soul
is
even
as
a
weaned
child.
131:003
Let
Israel
hope
in
the
LORD
from
henceforth
and
for
ever.
132:001
Lord,
remember
David,
and
all
his
afflictions:
132:002
How
he
sware
unto
the
LORD,
and
vowed
unto
the
mighty
God
of
Jacob;
132:003
Surely
I
will
not
come
into
the
tabernacle
of
my
house,
nor
go
up
into
my
bed;
132:004
I
will
not
give
sleep
to
mine
eyes,
or
slumber
to
mine
eyelids,
132:005
Until
I
find
out
a
place
for
the
LORD,
an
habitation
for
the
mighty
God
of
Jacob.
132:006
Lo,
we
heard
of
it
at
Ephratah:
we
found
it
in
the
fields
of
the
wood.
132:007
We
will
go
into
his
tabernacles:
we
will
worship
at
his
footstool.
132:008
Arise,
O
LORD,
into
thy
rest;
thou,
and
the
ark
of
thy
strength.
132:009
Let
thy
priests
be
clothed
with
righteousness;
and
let
thy
saints
shout
for
joy.
132:010
For
thy
servant
David's
sake
turn
not
away
the
face
of
thine
anointed.
132:011
The
LORD
hath
sworn
in
truth
unto
David;
he
will
not
turn
from
it;
Of
the
fruit
of
thy
body
will
I
set
upon
thy
throne.
132:012
If
thy
children
will
keep
my
covenant
and
my
testimony
that
I
shall
teach
them,
their
children
shall
also
sit
upon
thy
throne
for
evermore.
132:013
For
the
LORD
hath
chosen
Zion;
he
hath
desired
it
for
his
habitation.
132:014
This
is
my
rest
for
ever:
here
will
I
dwell;
for
I
have
desired
it.
132:015
I
will
abundantly
bless
her
provision:
I
will
satisfy
her
poor
with
bread.
132:016
I
will
also
clothe
her
priests
with
salvation:
and
her
saints
shall
shout
aloud
for
joy.
132:017
There
will
I
make
the
horn
of
David
to
bud:
I
have
ordained
a
lamp
for
mine
anointed.
132:018
His
enemies
will
I
clothe
with
shame:
but
upon
himself
shall
his
crown
flourish.
133:001
Behold,
how
good
and
how
pleasant
it
is
for
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
unity!
133:002
It
is
like
the
precious
ointment
upon
the
head,
that
ran
down
upon
the
beard,
even
Aaron's
beard:
that
went
down
to
the
skirts
of
his
garments;
133:003
As
the
dew
of
Hermon,
and
as
the
dew
that
descended
upon
the
mountains
of
Zion:
for
there
the
LORD
commanded
the
blessing,
even
life
for
evermore.
134:001
Behold,
bless
ye
the
LORD,
all
ye
servants
of
the
LORD,
which
by
night
stand
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
134:002
Lift
up
your
hands
in
the
sanctuary,
and
bless
the
LORD.
134:003
The
LORD
that
made
heaven
and
earth
bless
thee
out
of
