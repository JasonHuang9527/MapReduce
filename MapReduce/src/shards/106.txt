Zion.
135:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
Praise
ye
the
name
of
the
LORD;
praise
him,
O
ye
servants
of
the
LORD.
135:002
Ye
that
stand
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
in
the
courts
of
the
house
of
our
God.
135:003
Praise
the
LORD;
for
the
LORD
is
good:
sing
praises
unto
his
name;
for
it
is
pleasant.
135:004
For
the
LORD
hath
chosen
Jacob
unto
himself,
and
Israel
for
his
peculiar
treasure.
135:005
For
I
know
that
the
LORD
is
great,
and
that
our
Lord
is
above
all
gods.
135:006
Whatsoever
the
LORD
pleased,
that
did
he
in
heaven,
and
in
earth,
in
the
seas,
and
all
deep
places.
135:007
He
causeth
the
vapours
to
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth;
he
maketh
lightnings
for
the
rain;
he
bringeth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasuries.
135:008
Who
smote
the
firstborn
of
Egypt,
both
of
man
and
beast.
135:009
Who
sent
tokens
and
wonders
into
the
midst
of
thee,
O
Egypt,
upon
Pharaoh,
and
upon
all
his
servants.
135:010
Who
smote
great
nations,
and
slew
mighty
kings;
135:011
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
and
Og
king
of
Bashan,
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
Canaan:
135:012
And
gave
their
land
for
an
heritage,
an
heritage
unto
Israel
his
people.
135:013
Thy
name,
O
LORD,
endureth
for
ever;
and
thy
memorial,
O
LORD,
throughout
all
generations.
135:014
For
the
LORD
will
judge
his
people,
and
he
will
repent
himself
concerning
his
servants.
135:015
The
idols
of
the
heathen
are
silver
and
gold,
the
work
of
men's
hands.
135:016
They
have
mouths,
but
they
speak
not;
eyes
have
they,
but
they
see
not;
135:017
They
have
ears,
but
they
hear
not;
neither
is
there
any
breath
in
their
mouths.
135:018
They
that
make
them
are
like
unto
them:
so
is
every
one
that
trusteth
in
them.
135:019
Bless
the
LORD,
O
house
of
Israel:
bless
the
LORD,
O
house
of
Aaron:
135:020
Bless
the
LORD,
O
house
of
Levi:
ye
that
fear
the
LORD,
bless
the
LORD.
135:021
Blessed
be
the
LORD
out
of
Zion,
which
dwelleth
at
Jerusalem.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
136:001
O
give
thanks
unto
the
LORD;
for
he
is
good:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:002
O
give
thanks
unto
the
God
of
gods:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:003
O
give
thanks
to
the
Lord
of
lords:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:004
To
him
who
alone
doeth
great
wonders:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:005
To
him
that
by
wisdom
made
the
heavens:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:006
To
him
that
stretched
out
the
earth
above
the
waters:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:007
To
him
that
made
great
lights:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:008
The
sun
to
rule
by
day:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:009
The
moon
and
stars
to
rule
by
night:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:010
To
him
that
smote
Egypt
in
their
firstborn:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:011
And
brought
out
Israel
from
among
them:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:012
With
a
strong
hand,
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:013
To
him
which
divided
the
Red
sea
into
parts:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:014
And
made
Israel
to
pass
through
the
midst
of
it:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:015
But
overthrew
Pharaoh
and
his
host
in
the
Red
sea:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:016
To
him
which
led
his
people
through
the
wilderness:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:017
To
him
which
smote
great
kings:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:018
And
slew
famous
kings:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:019
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:020
And
Og
the
king
of
Bashan:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:021
And
gave
their
land
for
an
heritage:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:022
Even
an
heritage
unto
Israel
his
servant:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:023
Who
remembered
us
in
our
low
estate:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
136:024
And
hath
redeemed
us
from
our
enemies:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:025
Who
giveth
food
to
all
flesh:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
136:026
O
give
thanks
unto
the
God
of
heaven:
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
137:001
By
the
rivers
of
Babylon,
there
we
sat
down,
yea,
we
wept,
when
we
remembered
Zion.
137:002
We
hanged
our
harps
upon
the
willows
in
the
midst
thereof.
137:003
For
there
they
that
carried
us
away
captive
required
of
us
a
song;
and
they
that
wasted
us
required
of
us
mirth,
saying,
Sing
us
one
of
the
songs
of
Zion.
137:004
How
shall
we
sing
the
LORD's
song
in
a
strange
land?
137:005
If
I
forget
thee,
O
Jerusalem,
let
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning.
137:006
If
I
do
not
remember
thee,
let
my
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth;
if
I
prefer
not
Jerusalem
above
my
chief
joy.
137:007
Remember,
O
LORD,
the
children
of
Edom
in
the
day
of
Jerusalem;
who
said,
Rase
it,
rase
it,
even
to
the
foundation
thereof.
137:008
O
daughter
of
Babylon,
who
art
to
be
destroyed;
happy
shall
he
be,
that
rewardeth
thee
as
thou
hast
served
us.
137:009
Happy
shall
he
be,
that
taketh
and
dasheth
thy
little
ones
against
the
stones.
138:001
I
will
praise
thee
with
my
whole
heart:
before
the
gods
will
I
sing
praise
unto
thee.
138:002
I
will
worship
toward
thy
holy
temple,
and
praise
thy
name
for
thy
lovingkindness
and
for
thy
truth:
for
thou
hast
magnified
thy
word
above
all
thy
name.
138:003
In
the
day
when
I
cried
thou
answeredst
me,
and
strengthenedst
me
with
strength
in
my
soul.
138:004
All
the
kings
of
the
earth
shall
praise
thee,
O
LORD,
when
they
hear
the
words
of
thy
mouth.
138:005
Yea,
they
shall
sing
in
the
ways
of
the
LORD:
for
great
is
the
glory
of
the
LORD.
138:006
Though
the
LORD
be
high,
yet
hath
he
respect
unto
the
lowly:
but
the
proud
he
knoweth
afar
off.
138:007
Though
I
walk
in
the
midst
of
trouble,
thou
wilt
revive
me:
thou
shalt
stretch
forth
thine
hand
against
the
wrath
of
mine
enemies,
and
thy
right
hand
shall
save
me.
138:008
The
LORD
will
perfect
that
which
concerneth
me:
thy
mercy,
O
LORD,
endureth
for
ever:
forsake
not
the
works
of
thine
own
hands.
139:001
O
lord,
thou
hast
searched
me,
and
known
me.
139:002
Thou
knowest
my
downsitting
and
mine
uprising,
thou
understandest
my
thought
afar
off.
139:003
Thou
compassest
my
path
and
my
lying
down,
and
art
acquainted
with
all
my
ways.
139:004
For
there
is
not
a
word
in
my
tongue,
but,
lo,
O
LORD,
thou
knowest
it
altogether.
139:005
Thou
hast
beset
me
behind
and
before,
and
laid
thine
hand
upon
me.
139:006
Such
knowledge
is
too
wonderful
for
me;
it
is
high,
I
cannot
attain
unto
it.
139:007
Whither
shall
I
go
from
thy
spirit?
or
whither
shall
I
flee
from
thy
presence?
139:008
If
I
ascend
up
into
heaven,
thou
art
there:
if
I
make
my
bed
in
hell,
behold,
thou
art
there.
139:009
If
I
take
the
wings
of
the
morning,
and
dwell
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea;
139:010
Even
there
shall
thy
hand
lead
me,
and
thy
right
hand
shall
hold
me.
139:011
If
I
say,
Surely
the
darkness
shall
cover
me;
even
the
night
shall
be
light
about
me.
139:012
Yea,
the
darkness
hideth
not
from
thee;
but
the
night
shineth
as
the
day:
the
darkness
and
the
light
are
both
alike
to
thee.
139:013
For
thou
hast
possessed
my
reins:
thou
hast
covered
me
in
my
mother's
womb.
139:014
I
will
praise
thee;
for
I
am
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made:
marvellous
are
thy
works;
and
that
my
soul
knoweth
right
well.
139:015
My
substance
was
not
hid
from
thee,
when
I
was
made
in
secret,
and
curiously
wrought
in
the
lowest
parts
of
the
earth.
139:016
Thine
eyes
did
see
my
substance,
yet
being
unperfect;
and
in
thy
book
all
my
members
were
written,
which
in
continuance
were
fashioned,
when
as
yet
there
was
none
of
them.
139:017
How
precious
also
are
thy
thoughts
unto
me,
O
God!
how
great
is
the
sum
of
them!
139:018
If
I
should
count
them,
they
are
more
in
number
than
the
sand:
when
I
awake,
I
am
still
with
thee.
139:019
Surely
thou
wilt
slay
the
wicked,
O
God:
depart
from
me
therefore,
ye
bloody
men.
139:020
For
they
speak
against
thee
wickedly,
and
thine
enemies
take
thy
name
in
vain.
139:021
Do
not
I
hate
them,
O
LORD,
that
hate
thee?
and
am
not
I
grieved
with
those
that
rise
up
against
thee?
139:022
I
hate
them
with
perfect
hatred:
I
count
them
mine
enemies.
139:023
Search
me,
O
God,
and
know
my
heart:
try
me,
and
know
my
thoughts:
139:024
And
see
if
there
be
any
wicked
way
in
me,
and
lead
me
in
the
way
everlasting.
140:001
Deliver
me,
O
LORD,
from
the
evil
man:
preserve
me
from
the
violent
man;
140:002
Which
imagine
mischiefs
in
their
heart;
continually
are
they
gathered
together
for
war.
140:003
They
have
sharpened
their
tongues
like
a
serpent;
adders'
poison
is
under
their
lips.
Selah.
140:004
Keep
me,
O
LORD,
from
the
hands
of
the
wicked;
preserve
me
from
the
violent
man;
who
have
purposed
to
overthrow
my
goings.
140:005
The
proud
have
hid
a
snare
for
me,
and
cords;
they
have
spread
a
net
by
the
wayside;
they
have
set
gins
for
me.
Selah.
140:006
I
said
unto
the
LORD,
Thou
art
my
God:
hear
the
voice
of
my
supplications,
O
LORD.
140:007
O
GOD
the
Lord,
the
strength
of
my
salvation,
thou
hast
covered
my
head
in
the
day
of
battle.
140:008
Grant
not,
O
LORD,
the
desires
of
the
wicked:
further
not
his
wicked
device;
lest
they
exalt
themselves.
Selah.
140:009
As
for
the
head
of
those
that
compass
me
about,
let
the
mischief
of
their
own
lips
cover
them.
140:010
Let
burning
coals
fall
upon
them:
let
them
be
cast
into
the
fire;
into
deep
pits,
that
they
rise
not
up
again.
140:011
Let
not
an
evil
speaker
be
established
in
the
earth:
evil
shall
hunt
the
violent
man
to
overthrow
him.
140:012
I
know
that
the
LORD
will
maintain
the
cause
of
the
afflicted,
and
the
right
of
the
poor.
140:013
Surely
the
righteous
shall
give
thanks
unto
thy
name:
the
upright
shall
dwell
in
thy
presence.
141:001
Lord,
I
cry
unto
thee:
make
haste
unto
me;
give
ear
unto
my
voice,
when
I
cry
unto
thee.
141:002
Let
my
prayer
be
set
forth
before
thee
as
incense;
and
the
lifting
up
of
my
hands
as
the
evening
sacrifice.
141:003
Set
a
watch,
O
LORD,
before
my
mouth;
keep
the
door
of
my
lips.
141:004
Incline
not
my
heart
to
any
evil
thing,
to
practise
wicked
works
with
men
that
work
iniquity:
and
let
me
not
eat
of
their
dainties.
141:005
Let
the
righteous
smite
me;
it
shall
be
a
kindness:
and
let
him
reprove
me;
it
shall
be
an
excellent
oil,
which
shall
not
break
my
head:
for
yet
my
prayer
also
shall
be
in
their
calamities.
141:006
When
their
judges
are
overthrown
in
stony
places,
they
shall
hear
my
words;
for
they
are
sweet.
141:007
Our
bones
are
scattered
at
the
grave's
mouth,
as
when
one
cutteth
and
cleaveth
wood
upon
the
earth.
141:008
But
mine
eyes
are
unto
thee,
O
GOD
the
Lord:
in
thee
is
my
trust;
leave
not
my
soul
destitute.
141:009
Keep
me
from
the
snares
which
they
have
laid
for
me,
and
the
gins
of
the
workers
of
iniquity.
141:010
Let
the
wicked
fall
into
their
own
nets,
whilst
that
I
withal
escape.
142:001
I
cried
unto
the
LORD
with
my
voice;
with
my
voice
unto
the
LORD
did
I
make
my
supplication.
142:002
I
poured
out
my
complaint
before
him;
I
shewed
before
him
my
trouble.
142:003
When
my
spirit
was
overwhelmed
within
me,
then
thou
knewest
my
path.
In
the
way
wherein
I
walked
have
they
privily
laid
a
snare
for
me.
142:004
I
looked
on
my
right
hand,
and
beheld,
but
there
was
no
man
that
would
know
me:
refuge
failed
me;
no
man
cared
for
my
soul.
142:005
I
cried
unto
thee,
O
LORD:
I
said,
Thou
art
my
refuge
and
my
portion
in
the
land
of
the
living.
142:006
Attend
unto
my
cry;
for
I
am
brought
very
low:
deliver
me
from
my
persecutors;
for
they
are
stronger
than
I.
142:007
Bring
my
soul
out
of
prison,
that
I
may
praise
thy
name:
the
righteous
shall
compass
me
about;
for
thou
shalt
deal
bountifully
with
me.
143:001
Hear
my
prayer,
O
LORD,
give
ear
to
my
supplications:
in
thy
faithfulness
answer
me,
and
in
thy
righteousness.
143:002
And
enter
not
into
judgment
with
thy
servant:
for
in
thy
sight
shall
no
man
living
be
justified.
143:003
For
the
enemy
hath
persecuted
my
soul;
he
hath
smitten
my
life
down
to
the
ground;
he
hath
made
me
to
dwell
in
darkness,
as
those
that
have
been
long
dead.
143:004
Therefore
is
my
spirit
overwhelmed
within
me;
my
heart
within
me
is
desolate.
143:005
I
remember
the
days
of
old;
I
meditate
on
all
thy
works;
I
muse
on
the
work
of
thy
hands.
143:006
I
stretch
forth
my
hands
unto
thee:
my
soul
thirsteth
after
thee,
as
a
thirsty
land.
Selah.
143:007
Hear
me
speedily,
O
LORD:
my
spirit
faileth:
hide
not
thy
face
from
me,
lest
I
be
like
unto
them
that
go
down
into
the
pit.
143:008
Cause
me
to
hear
thy
lovingkindness
in
the
morning;
for
in
thee
do
I
trust:
cause
me
to
know
the
way
wherein
I
should
walk;
for
I
lift
up
my
soul
unto
thee.
143:009
Deliver
me,
O
LORD,
from
mine
enemies:
I
flee
unto
thee
to
hide
me.
143:010
Teach
me
to
do
thy
will;
for
thou
art
my
God:
thy
spirit
is
good;
lead
me
into
the
land
of
uprightness.
143:011
Quicken
me,
O
LORD,
for
thy
name's
sake:
for
thy
righteousness'
sake
bring
my
soul
out
of
trouble.
143:012
And
of
thy
mercy
cut
off
mine
enemies,
and
destroy
all
them
that
afflict
my
soul:
for
I
am
thy
servant.
144:001
Blessed
be
the
LORD
my
strength
which
teacheth
my
hands
to
war,
and
my
fingers
to
fight:
144:002
My
goodness,
and
my
fortress;
my
high
tower,
and
my
deliverer;
my
shield,
and
he
in
whom
I
trust;
who
subdueth
my
people
under
me.
144:003
LORD,
what
is
man,
that
thou
takest
knowledge
of
him!
or
the
son
of
man,
that
thou
makest
account
of
him!
144:004
Man
is
like
to
vanity:
his
days
are
as
a
shadow
that
passeth
away.
144:005
Bow
thy
heavens,
O
LORD,
and
come
down:
touch
the
mountains,
and
they
shall
smoke.
144:006
Cast
forth
lightning,
and
scatter
them:
shoot
out
thine
arrows,
and
destroy
them.
144:007
Send
thine
hand
from
above;
rid
me,
and
deliver
me
out
of
great
waters,
from
the
hand
of
strange
children;
144:008
Whose
mouth
speaketh
vanity,
and
their
right
hand
is
a
right
hand
of
falsehood.
144:009
I
will
sing
a
new
song
unto
thee,
O
God:
upon
a
psaltery
and
an
instrument
of
ten
strings
will
I
sing
praises
unto
thee.
144:010
It
is
he
that
giveth
salvation
unto
kings:
who
delivereth
David
his
servant
from
the
hurtful
sword.
144:011
Rid
me,
and
deliver
me
from
the
hand
of
strange
children,
whose
mouth
speaketh
vanity,
and
their
right
hand
is
a
right
hand
of
falsehood:
144:012
That
our
sons
may
be
as
plants
grown
up
in
their
youth;
that
our
daughters
may
be
as
corner
stones,
polished
after
the
similitude
of
a
palace:
144:013
That
our
garners
may
be
full,
affording
all
manner
of
store:
that
our
sheep
may
bring
forth
thousands
and
ten
thousands
in
our
streets:
144:014
That
our
oxen
may
be
strong
to
labour;
that
there
be
no
breaking
in,
nor
going
out;
that
there
be
no
complaining
in
our
streets.
144:015
Happy
is
that
people,
that
is
in
such
a
case:
yea,
happy
is
that
people,
whose
God
is
the
LORD.
145:001
I
will
extol
thee,
my
God,
O
king;
and
I
will
bless
thy
name
for
ever
and
ever.
145:002
Every
day
will
I
bless
thee;
and
I
will
praise
thy
name
for
ever
and
ever.
145:003
Great
is
the
LORD,
and
greatly
to
be
praised;
and
his
greatness
is
unsearchable.
145:004
One
generation
shall
praise
thy
works
to
another,
and
shall
declare
thy
mighty
acts.
145:005
I
will
speak
of
the
glorious
honour
of
thy
majesty,
and
of
thy
wondrous
works.
145:006
And
men
shall
speak
of
the
might
of
thy
terrible
acts:
and
I
will
declare
thy
greatness.
145:007
They
shall
abundantly
utter
the
memory
of
thy
great
goodness,
and
shall
sing
of
thy
righteousness.
145:008
The
LORD
is
gracious,
and
full
of
compassion;
slow
to
anger,
and
of
great
mercy.
145:009
The
LORD
is
good
to
all:
and
his
tender
mercies
are
over
all
his
works.
145:010
All
thy
works
shall
praise
thee,
O
LORD;
and
thy
saints
shall
bless
thee.
145:011
They
shall
speak
of
the
glory
of
thy
kingdom,
and
talk
of
thy
power;
145:012
To
make
known
to
the
sons
of
men
his
mighty
acts,
and
the
glorious
majesty
of
his
kingdom.
145:013
Thy
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom,
and
thy
dominion
endureth
throughout
all
generations.
145:014
The
LORD
upholdeth
all
that
fall,
and
raiseth
up
all
those
that
be
bowed
down.
145:015
The
eyes
of
all
wait
upon
thee;
and
thou
givest
them
their
meat
in
due
season.
145:016
Thou
openest
thine
hand,
and
satisfiest
the
desire
of
every
living
thing.
145:017
The
LORD
is
righteous
in
all
his
ways,
and
holy
in
all
his
works.
145:018
The
LORD
is
nigh
unto
all
them
that
call
upon
him,
to
all
that
call
upon
him
in
truth.
145:019
He
will
fulfil
the
desire
of
them
that
fear
him:
he
also
will
hear
their
cry,
and
will
save
them.
145:020
The
LORD
preserveth
all
them
that
love
him:
but
all
the
wicked
will
he
destroy.
145:021
My
mouth
shall
speak
the
praise
of
the
LORD:
and
let
all
flesh
bless
his
holy
name
for
ever
and
ever.
146:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
Praise
the
LORD,
O
my
soul.
146:002
While
I
live
will
I
praise
the
LORD:
I
will
sing
praises
unto
my
God
while
I
have
any
being.
146:003
Put
not
your
trust
in
princes,
nor
in
the
son
of
man,
in
whom
there
is
no
help.
146:004
His
breath
goeth
forth,
he
returneth
to
his
earth;
in
that
very
day
his
thoughts
perish.
146:005
Happy
is
he
that
hath
the
God
of
Jacob
for
his
help,
whose
hope
is
in
the
LORD
his
God:
146:006
Which
made
heaven,
and
earth,
the
sea,
and
all
that
therein
is:
which
keepeth
truth
for
ever:
146:007
Which
executeth
judgment
for
the
oppressed:
which
giveth
food
to
the
hungry.
The
LORD
looseth
the
prisoners:
146:008
The
LORD
openeth
the
eyes
of
the
blind:
the
LORD
raiseth
them
that
are
bowed
down:
the
LORD
loveth
the
righteous:
146:009
The
LORD
preserveth
the
strangers;
he
relieveth
the
fatherless
and
widow:
but
the
way
of
the
wicked
he
turneth
upside
down.
146:010
The
LORD
shall
reign
for
ever,
even
thy
God,
O
Zion,
unto
all
generations.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
147:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD:
for
it
is
good
to
sing
praises
unto
our
God;
for
it
is
pleasant;
and
praise
is
comely.
147:002
The
LORD
doth
build
up
Jerusalem:
he
gathereth
together
the
outcasts
of
Israel.
147:003
He
healeth
the
broken
in
heart,
and
bindeth
up
their
wounds.
147:004
He
telleth
the
number
of
the
stars;
he
calleth
them
all
by
their
names.
147:005
Great
is
our
Lord,
and
of
great
power:
his
understanding
is
infinite.
147:006
The
LORD
lifteth
up
the
meek:
he
casteth
the
wicked
down
to
the
ground.
147:007
Sing
unto
the
LORD
with
thanksgiving;
sing
praise
upon
the
harp
unto
our
God:
147:008
Who
covereth
the
heaven
with
clouds,
who
prepareth
rain
for
the
earth,
who
maketh
grass
to
grow
upon
the
mountains.
147:009
He
giveth
to
the
beast
his
food,
and
to
the
young
ravens
which
cry.
147:010
He
delighteth
not
in
the
strength
of
the
horse:
he
taketh
not
pleasure
in
the
legs
of
a
man.
147:011
The
LORD
taketh
pleasure
in
them
that
fear
him,
in
those
that
hope
in
his
mercy.
147:012
Praise
the
LORD,
O
Jerusalem;
praise
thy
God,
O
Zion.
147:013
For
he
hath
strengthened
the
bars
of
thy
gates;
he
hath
blessed
thy
children
within
thee.
147:014
He
maketh
peace
in
thy
borders,
and
filleth
thee
with
the
finest
of
the
wheat.
147:015
He
sendeth
forth
his
commandment
upon
earth:
his
word
runneth
very
swiftly.
147:016
He
giveth
snow
like
wool:
he
scattereth
the
hoarfrost
like
ashes.
147:017
He
casteth
forth
his
ice
like
morsels:
who
can
stand
before
his
cold?
147:018
He
sendeth
out
his
word,
and
melteth
them:
he
causeth
his
wind
to
blow,
and
the
waters
flow.
147:019
He
sheweth
his
word
unto
Jacob,
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
unto
Israel.
147:020
He
hath
not
dealt
so
with
any
nation:
and
as
for
his
judgments,
they
have
not
known
them.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
148:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
Praise
ye
the
LORD
from
the
heavens:
praise
him
in
the
heights.
148:002
Praise
ye
him,
all
his
angels:
praise
ye
him,
all
his
hosts.
148:003
Praise
ye
him,
sun
and
moon:
praise
him,
all
ye
stars
of
light.
148:004
Praise
him,
ye
heavens
of
heavens,
and
ye
waters
that
be
above
the
heavens.
148:005
Let
them
praise
the
name
of
the
LORD:
for
he
commanded,
and
they
were
created.
148:006
He
hath
also
stablished
them
for
ever
and
ever:
he
hath
made
a
decree
which
shall
not
pass.
148:007
Praise
the
LORD
from
the
earth,
ye
dragons,
and
all
deeps:
148:008
Fire,
and
hail;
snow,
and
vapours;
stormy
wind
fulfilling
his
word:
148:009
Mountains,
and
all
hills;
fruitful
trees,
and
all
cedars:
148:010
Beasts,
and
all
cattle;
creeping
things,
and
flying
fowl:
148:011
Kings
of
the
earth,
and
all
people;
princes,
and
all
judges
of
the
earth:
148:012
Both
young
men,
and
maidens;
old
men,
and
children:
148:013
Let
them
praise
the
name
of
the
LORD:
for
his
name
alone
is
excellent;
his
glory
is
above
the
earth
and
heaven.
148:014
He
also
exalteth
the
horn
of
his
people,
the
praise
of
all
his
saints;
even
of
the
children
of
Israel,
a
people
near
unto
him.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
149:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
Sing
unto
the
LORD
a
new
song,
and
his
praise
in
the
congregation
of
saints.
149:002
Let
Israel
rejoice
in
him
that
made
him:
let
the
children
of
Zion
be
joyful
in
their
King.
149:003
Let
them
praise
his
name
in
the
dance:
let
them
sing
praises
unto
him
with
the
timbrel
and
harp.
149:004
For
the
LORD
taketh
pleasure
in
his
people:
he
will
beautify
the
meek
with
salvation.
149:005
Let
the
saints
be
joyful
in
glory:
let
them
sing
aloud
upon
their
beds.
149:006
Let
the
high
praises
of
God
be
in
their
mouth,
and
a
two-edged
sword
in
their
hand;
149:007
To
execute
vengeance
upon
the
heathen,
and
punishments
upon
the
people;
149:008
To
bind
their
kings
with
chains,
and
their
nobles
with
fetters
of
iron;
149:009
To
execute
upon
them
the
judgment
written:
this
honour
have
all
his
saints.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
150:001
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
Praise
God
in
his
sanctuary:
praise
him
in
the
firmament
of
his
power.
150:002
Praise
him
for
his
mighty
acts:
praise
him
according
to
his
excellent
greatness.
150:003
Praise
him
with
the
sound
of
the
trumpet:
praise
him
with
the
psaltery
and
harp.
150:004
Praise
him
with
the
timbrel
and
dance:
praise
him
with
stringed
instruments
and
organs.
150:005
Praise
him
upon
the
loud
cymbals:
praise
him
upon
the
high
sounding
cymbals.
150:006
Let
every
thing
that
hath
breath
praise
the
LORD.
Praise
ye
the
LORD.
