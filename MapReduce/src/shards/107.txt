will
hear,
and
will
increase
learning;
and
a
man
of
understanding
shall
attain
unto
wise
counsels:
001:006
To
understand
a
proverb,
and
the
interpretation;
the
words
of
the
wise,
and
their
dark
sayings.
001:007
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
the
beginning
of
knowledge:
but
fools
despise
wisdom
and
instruction.
001:008
My
son,
hear
the
instruction
of
thy
father,
and
forsake
not
the
law
of
thy
mother:
001:009
For
they
shall
be
an
ornament
of
grace
unto
thy
head,
and
chains
about
thy
neck.
001:010
My
son,
if
sinners
entice
thee,
consent
thou
not.
001:011
If
they
say,
Come
with
us,
let
us
lay
wait
for
blood,
let
us
lurk
privily
for
the
innocent
without
cause:
001:012
Let
us
swallow
them
up
alive
as
the
grave;
and
whole,
as
those
that
go
down
into
the
pit:
001:013
We
shall
find
all
precious
substance,
we
shall
fill
our
houses
with
spoil:
001:014
Cast
in
thy
lot
among
us;
let
us
all
have
one
purse:
001:015
My
son,
walk
not
thou
in
the
way
with
them;
refrain
thy
foot
from
their
path:
001:016
For
their
feet
run
to
evil,
and
make
haste
to
shed
blood.
001:017
Surely
in
vain
the
net
is
spread
in
the
sight
of
any
bird.
001:018
And
they
lay
wait
for
their
own
blood;
they
lurk
privily
for
their
own
lives.
001:019
So
are
the
ways
of
every
one
that
is
greedy
of
gain;
which
taketh
away
the
life
of
the
owners
thereof.
001:020
Wisdom
crieth
without;
she
uttereth
her
voice
in
the
streets:
001:021
She
crieth
in
the
chief
place
of
concourse,
in
the
openings
of
the
gates:
in
the
city
she
uttereth
her
words,
saying,
001:022
How
long,
ye
simple
ones,
will
ye
love
simplicity?
and
the
scorners
delight
in
their
scorning,
and
fools
hate
knowledge?
001:023
Turn
you
at
my
reproof:
behold,
I
will
pour
out
my
spirit
unto
you,
I
will
make
known
my
words
unto
you.
001:024
Because
I
have
called,
and
ye
refused;
I
have
stretched
out
my
hand,
and
no
man
regarded;
001:025
But
ye
have
set
at
nought
all
my
counsel,
and
would
none
of
my
reproof:
001:026
I
also
will
laugh
at
your
calamity;
I
will
mock
when
your
fear
cometh;
001:027
When
your
fear
cometh
as
desolation,
and
your
destruction
cometh
as
a
whirlwind;
when
distress
and
anguish
cometh
upon
you.
001:028
Then
shall
they
call
upon
me,
but
I
will
not
answer;
they
shall
seek
me
early,
but
they
shall
not
find
me:
001:029
For
that
they
hated
knowledge,
and
did
not
choose
the
fear
of
the
LORD:
001:030
They
would
none
of
my
counsel:
they
despised
all
my
reproof.
001:031
Therefore
shall
they
eat
of
the
fruit
of
their
own
way,
and
be
filled
with
their
own
devices.
001:032
For
the
turning
away
of
the
simple
shall
slay
them,
and
the
prosperity
of
fools
shall
destroy
them.
001:033
But
whoso
hearkeneth
unto
me
shall
dwell
safely,
and
shall
be
quiet
from
fear
of
evil.
002:001
My
son,
if
thou
wilt
receive
my
words,
and
hide
my
commandments
with
thee;
002:002
So
that
thou
incline
thine
ear
unto
wisdom,
and
apply
thine
heart
to
understanding;
002:003
Yea,
if
thou
criest
after
knowledge,
and
liftest
up
thy
voice
for
understanding;
002:004
If
thou
seekest
her
as
silver,
and
searchest
for
her
as
for
hid
treasures;
002:005
Then
shalt
thou
understand
the
fear
of
the
LORD,
and
find
the
knowledge
of
God.
002:006
For
the
LORD
giveth
wisdom:
out
of
his
mouth
cometh
knowledge
and
understanding.
002:007
He
layeth
up
sound
wisdom
for
the
righteous:
he
is
a
buckler
to
them
that
walk
uprightly.
002:008
He
keepeth
the
paths
of
judgment,
and
preserveth
the
way
of
his
saints.
002:009
Then
shalt
thou
understand
righteousness,
and
judgment,
and
equity;
yea,
every
good
path.
002:010
When
wisdom
entereth
into
thine
heart,
and
knowledge
is
pleasant
unto
thy
soul;
002:011
Discretion
shall
preserve
thee,
understanding
shall
keep
thee:
002:012
To
deliver
thee
from
the
way
of
the
evil
man,
from
the
man
that
speaketh
froward
things;
002:013
Who
leave
the
paths
of
uprightness,
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
darkness;
002:014
Who
rejoice
to
do
evil,
and
delight
in
the
frowardness
of
the
wicked;
002:015
Whose
ways
are
crooked,
and
they
froward
in
their
paths:
002:016
To
deliver
thee
from
the
strange
woman,
even
from
the
stranger
which
flattereth
with
her
words;
002:017
Which
forsaketh
the
guide
of
her
youth,
and
forgetteth
the
covenant
of
her
God.
002:018
For
her
house
inclineth
unto
death,
and
her
paths
unto
the
dead.
002:019
None
that
go
unto
her
return
again,
neither
take
they
hold
of
the
paths
of
life.
002:020
That
thou
mayest
walk
in
the
way
of
good
men,
and
keep
the
paths
of
the
righteous.
002:021
For
the
upright
shall
dwell
in
the
land,
and
the
perfect
shall
remain
in
it.
002:022
But
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
earth,
and
the
transgressors
shall
be
rooted
out
of
it.
003:001
My
son,
forget
not
my
law;
but
let
thine
heart
keep
my
commandments:
003:002
For
length
of
days,
and
long
life,
and
peace,
shall
they
add
to
thee.
003:003
Let
not
mercy
and
truth
forsake
thee:
bind
them
about
thy
neck;
write
them
upon
the
table
of
thine
heart:
003:004
So
shalt
thou
find
favour
and
good
understanding
in
the
sight
of
God
and
man.
003:005
Trust
in
the
LORD
with
all
thine
heart;
and
lean
not
unto
thine
own
understanding.
003:006
In
all
thy
ways
acknowledge
him,
and
he
shall
direct
thy
paths.
003:007
Be
not
wise
in
thine
own
eyes:
fear
the
LORD,
and
depart
from
evil.
003:008
It
shall
be
health
to
thy
navel,
and
marrow
to
thy
bones.
003:009
Honour
the
LORD
with
thy
substance,
and
with
the
firstfruits
of
all
thine
increase:
003:010
So
shall
thy
barns
be
filled
with
plenty,
and
thy
presses
shall
burst
out
with
new
wine.
003:011
My
son,
despise
not
the
chastening
of
the
LORD;
neither
be
weary
of
his
correction:
003:012
For
whom
the
LORD
loveth
he
correcteth;
even
as
a
father
the
son
in
whom
he
delighteth.
003:013
Happy
is
the
man
that
findeth
wisdom,
and
the
man
that
getteth
understanding.
003:014
For
the
merchandise
of
it
is
better
than
the
merchandise
of
silver,
and
the
gain
thereof
than
fine
gold.
003:015
She
is
more
precious
than
rubies:
and
all
the
things
thou
canst
desire
are
not
to
be
compared
unto
her.
003:016
Length
of
days
is
in
her
right
hand;
and
in
her
left
hand
riches
and
honour.
003:017
Her
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness,
and
all
her
paths
are
peace.
003:018
She
is
a
tree
of
life
to
them
that
lay
hold
upon
her:
and
happy
is
every
one
that
retaineth
her.
003:019
The
LORD
by
wisdom
hath
founded
the
earth;
by
understanding
hath
he
established
the
heavens.
003:020
By
his
knowledge
the
depths
are
broken
up,
and
the
clouds
drop
down
the
dew.
003:021
My
son,
let
not
them
depart
from
thine
eyes:
keep
sound
wisdom
and
discretion:
003:022
So
shall
they
be
life
unto
thy
soul,
and
grace
to
thy
neck.
003:023
Then
shalt
thou
walk
in
thy
way
safely,
and
thy
foot
shall
not
stumble.
003:024
When
thou
liest
down,
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid:
yea,
thou
shalt
lie
down,
and
thy
sleep
shall
be
sweet.
003:025
Be
not
afraid
of
sudden
fear,
neither
of
the
desolation
of
the
wicked,
when
it
cometh.
003:026
For
the
LORD
shall
be
thy
confidence,
and
shall
keep
thy
foot
from
being
taken.
003:027
Withhold
not
good
from
them
to
whom
it
is
due,
when
it
is
in
the
power
of
thine
hand
to
do
it.
003:028
Say
not
unto
thy
neighbour,
Go,
and
come
again,
and
to
morrow
I
will
give;
when
thou
hast
it
by
thee.
003:029
Devise
not
evil
against
thy
neighbour,
seeing
he
dwelleth
securely
by
thee.
003:030
Strive
not
with
a
man
without
cause,
if
he
have
done
thee
no
harm.
003:031
Envy
thou
not
the
oppressor,
and
choose
none
of
his
ways.
003:032
For
the
froward
is
abomination
to
the
LORD:
but
his
secret
is
with
the
righteous.
003:033
The
curse
of
the
LORD
is
in
the
house
of
the
wicked:
but
he
blesseth
the
habitation
of
the
just.
003:034
Surely
he
scorneth
the
scorners:
but
he
giveth
grace
unto
the
lowly.
003:035
The
wise
shall
inherit
glory:
but
shame
shall
be
the
promotion
of
fools.
004:001
Hear,
ye
children,
the
instruction
of
a
father,
and
attend
to
know
understanding.
004:002
For
I
give
you
good
doctrine,
forsake
ye
not
my
law.
004:003
For
I
was
my
father's
son,
tender
and
only
beloved
in
the
sight
of
my
mother.
004:004
He
taught
me
also,
and
said
unto
me,
Let
thine
heart
retain
my
words:
keep
my
commandments,
and
live.
004:005
Get
wisdom,
get
understanding:
forget
it
not;
neither
decline
from
the
words
of
my
mouth.
004:006
Forsake
her
not,
and
she
shall
preserve
thee:
love
her,
and
she
shall
keep
thee.
004:007
Wisdom
is
the
principal
thing;
therefore
get
wisdom:
and
with
all
thy
getting
get
understanding.
004:008
Exalt
her,
and
she
shall
promote
thee:
she
shall
bring
thee
to
honour,
when
thou
dost
embrace
her.
004:009
She
shall
give
to
thine
head
an
ornament
of
grace:
a
crown
of
glory
shall
she
deliver
to
thee.
004:010
Hear,
O
my
son,
and
receive
my
sayings;
and
the
years
of
thy
life
shall
be
many.
004:011
I
have
taught
thee
in
the
way
of
wisdom;
I
have
led
thee
in
right
paths.
004:012
When
thou
goest,
thy
steps
shall
not
be
straitened;
and
when
thou
runnest,
thou
shalt
not
stumble.
004:013
Take
fast
hold
of
instruction;
let
her
not
go:
keep
her;
for
she
is
thy
life.
004:014
Enter
not
into
the
path
of
the
wicked,
and
go
not
in
the
way
of
evil
men.
004:015
Avoid
it,
pass
not
by
it,
turn
from
it,
and
pass
away.
004:016
For
they
sleep
not,
except
they
have
done
mischief;
and
their
sleep
is
taken
away,
unless
they
cause
some
to
fall.
004:017
For
they
eat
the
bread
of
wickedness,
and
drink
the
wine
of
violence.
004:018
But
the
path
of
the
just
is
as
the
shining
light,
that
shineth
more
and
more
unto
the
perfect
day.
004:019
The
way
of
the
wicked
is
as
darkness:
they
know
not
at
what
they
stumble.
004:020
My
son,
attend
to
my
words;
incline
thine
ear
unto
my
sayings.
004:021
Let
them
not
depart
from
thine
eyes;
keep
them
in
the
midst
of
thine
heart.
004:022
For
they
are
life
unto
those
that
find
them,
and
health
to
all
their
flesh.
004:023
Keep
thy
heart
with
all
diligence;
for
out
of
it
are
the
issues
of
life.
004:024
Put
away
from
thee
a
froward
mouth,
and
perverse
lips
put
far
from
thee.
004:025
Let
thine
eyes
look
right
on,
and
let
thine
eyelids
look
straight
before
thee.
004:026
Ponder
the
path
of
thy
feet,
and
let
all
thy
ways
be
established.
004:027
Turn
not
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left:
remove
thy
foot
from
evil.
005:001
My
son,
attend
unto
my
wisdom,
and
bow
thine
ear
to
my
understanding:
005:002
That
thou
mayest
regard
discretion,
and
that
thy
lips
may
keep
knowledge.
005:003
For
the
lips
of
a
strange
woman
drop
as
an
honeycomb,
and
her
mouth
is
smoother
than
oil:
005:004
But
her
end
is
bitter
as
wormwood,
sharp
as
a
two-edged
sword.
005:005
Her
feet
go
down
to
death;
her
steps
take
hold
on
hell.
005:006
Lest
thou
shouldest
ponder
the
path
of
life,
her
ways
are
moveable,
that
thou
canst
not
know
them.
005:007
Hear
me
now
therefore,
O
ye
children,
and
depart
not
from
the
words
of
my
mouth.
005:008
Remove
thy
way
far
from
her,
and
come
not
nigh
the
door
of
her
house:
005:009
Lest
thou
give
thine
honour
unto
others,
and
thy
years
unto
the
cruel:
005:010
Lest
strangers
be
filled
with
thy
wealth;
and
thy
labours
be
in
the
house
of
a
stranger;
005:011
And
thou
mourn
at
the
last,
when
thy
flesh
and
thy
body
are
consumed,
005:012
And
say,
How
have
I
hated
instruction,
and
my
heart
despised
reproof;
005:013
And
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
my
teachers,
nor
inclined
mine
ear
to
them
that
instructed
me!
005:014
I
was
almost
in
all
evil
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
assembly.
005:015
Drink
waters
out
of
thine
own
cistern,
and
running
waters
out
of
thine
own
well.
005:016
Let
thy
fountains
be
dispersed
abroad,
and
rivers
of
waters
in
the
streets.
005:017
Let
them
be
only
thine
own,
and
not
strangers'
with
thee.
005:018
Let
thy
fountain
be
blessed:
and
rejoice
with
the
wife
of
thy
youth.
005:019
Let
her
be
as
the
loving
hind
and
pleasant
roe;
let
her
breasts
satisfy
thee
at
all
times;
and
be
thou
ravished
always
with
her
love.
005:020
And
why
wilt
thou,
my
son,
be
ravished
with
a
strange
woman,
and
embrace
the
bosom
of
a
stranger?
005:021
For
the
ways
of
man
are
before
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
and
he
pondereth
all
his
goings.
005:022
His
own
iniquities
shall
take
the
wicked
himself,
and
he
shall
be
holden
with
the
cords
of
his
sins.
005:023
He
shall
die
without
instruction;
and
in
the
greatness
of
his
folly
he
shall
go
astray.
006:001
My
son,
if
thou
be
surety
for
thy
friend,
if
thou
hast
stricken
thy
hand
with
a
stranger,
006:002
Thou
art
snared
with
the
words
of
thy
mouth,
thou
art
taken
with
the
words
of
thy
mouth.
006:003
Do
this
now,
my
son,
and
deliver
thyself,
when
thou
art
come
into
the
hand
of
thy
friend;
go,
humble
thyself,
and
make
sure
thy
friend.
006:004
Give
not
sleep
to
thine
eyes,
nor
slumber
to
thine
eyelids.
006:005
Deliver
thyself
as
a
roe
from
the
hand
of
the
hunter,
and
as
a
bird
from
the
hand
of
the
fowler.
006:006
Go
to
the
ant,
thou
sluggard;
consider
her
ways,
and
be
wise:
006:007
Which
having
no
guide,
overseer,
or
ruler,
006:008
Provideth
her
meat
in
the
summer,
and
gathereth
her
food
in
the
harvest.
006:009
How
long
wilt
thou
sleep,
O
sluggard?
when
wilt
thou
arise
out
of
thy
sleep?
006:010
Yet
a
little
sleep,
a
little
slumber,
a
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
sleep:
006:011
So
shall
thy
poverty
come
as
one
that
travelleth,
and
thy
want
as
an
armed
man.
006:012
A
naughty
person,
a
wicked
man,
walketh
with
a
froward
mouth.
006:013
He
winketh
with
his
eyes,
he
speaketh
with
his
feet,
he
teacheth
with
his
fingers;
006:014
Frowardness
is
in
his
heart,
he
deviseth
mischief
continually;
he
soweth
discord.
006:015
Therefore
shall
his
calamity
come
suddenly;
suddenly
shall
he
be
broken
without
remedy.
006:016
These
six
things
doth
the
LORD
hate:
yea,
seven
are
an
abomination
unto
him:
006:017
A
proud
look,
a
lying
tongue,
and
hands
that
shed
innocent
blood,
006:018
An
heart
that
deviseth
wicked
imaginations,
feet
that
be
swift
in
running
to
mischief,
006:019
A
false
witness
that
speaketh
lies,
and
he
that
soweth
discord
among
brethren.
006:020
My
son,
keep
thy
father's
commandment,
and
forsake
not
the
law
of
thy
mother:
006:021
Bind
them
continually
upon
thine
heart,
and
tie
them
about
thy
neck.
006:022
When
thou
goest,
it
shall
lead
thee;
when
thou
sleepest,
it
shall
keep
thee;
and
when
thou
awakest,
it
shall
talk
with
thee.
006:023
For
the
commandment
is
a
lamp;
and
the
law
is
light;
and
reproofs
of
instruction
are
the
way
of
life:
006:024
To
keep
thee
from
the
evil
woman,
from
the
flattery
of
the
tongue
of
a
strange
woman.
006:025
Lust
not
after
her
beauty
in
thine
heart;
neither
let
her
take
thee
with
her
eyelids.
006:026
For
by
means
of
a
whorish
woman
a
man
is
brought
to
a
piece
of
bread:
and
the
adultress
will
hunt
for
the
precious
life.
006:027
Can
a
man
take
fire
in
his
bosom,
and
his
clothes
not
be
burned?
006:028
Can
one
go
upon
hot
coals,
and
his
feet
not
be
burned?
006:029
So
he
that
goeth
in
to
his
neighbour's
wife;
whosoever
toucheth
her
shall
not
be
innocent.
006:030
Men
do
not
despise
a
thief,
if
he
steal
to
satisfy
his
soul
when
he
is
hungry;
006:031
But
if
he
be
found,
he
shall
restore
sevenfold;
he
shall
give
all
the
substance
of
his
house.
006:032
But
whoso
committeth
adultery
with
a
woman
lacketh
understanding:
he
that
doeth
it
destroyeth
his
own
soul.
006:033
A
wound
and
dishonour
shall
he
get;
and
his
reproach
shall
not
be
wiped
away.
006:034
For
jealousy
is
the
rage
of
a
man:
therefore
he
will
not
spare
in
the
day
of
vengeance.
006:035
He
will
not
regard
any
ransom;
neither
will
he
rest
content,
though
thou
givest
many
gifts.
007:001
My
son,
keep
my
words,
and
lay
up
my
commandments
with
thee.
007:002
Keep
my
commandments,
and
live;
and
my
law
as
the
apple
of
thine
eye.
007:003
Bind
them
upon
thy
fingers,
write
them
upon
the
table
of
thine
heart.
007:004
Say
unto
wisdom,
Thou
art
my
sister;
and
call
understanding
thy
kinswoman:
007:005
That
they
may
keep
thee
from
the
strange
woman,
from
the
stranger
which
flattereth
with
her
words.
007:006
For
at
the
window
of
my
house
I
looked
through
my
casement,
007:007
And
beheld
among
the
simple
ones,
I
discerned
among
the
youths,
a
young
man
void
of
understanding,
007:008
Passing
through
the
street
near
her
corner;
and
he
went
the
way
to
her
house,
007:009
In
the
twilight,
in
the
evening,
in
the
black
and
dark
night:
007:010
And,
behold,
there
met
him
a
woman
with
the
attire
of
an
harlot,
and
subtil
of
heart.
007:011
(She
is
loud
and
stubborn;
her
feet
abide
not
in
her
house:
007:012
Now
is
she
without,
now
in
the
streets,
and
lieth
in
wait
at
every
corner.)
007:013
So
she
caught
him,
and
kissed
him,
and
with
an
impudent
face
said
unto
him,
007:014
I
have
peace
offerings
with
me;
this
day
have
I
payed
my
vows.
007:015
Therefore
came
I
forth
to
meet
thee,
diligently
to
seek
thy
face,
and
I
have
found
thee.
007:016
I
have
decked
my
bed
with
coverings
of
tapestry,
with
carved
works,
with
fine
linen
of
Egypt.
007:017
I
have
perfumed
my
bed
with
myrrh,
aloes,
and
cinnamon.
007:018
Come,
let
us
take
our
fill
of
love
until
the
morning:
let
us
solace
ourselves
with
loves.
007:019
For
the
goodman
is
not
at
home,
he
is
gone
a
long
journey:
007:020
He
hath
taken
a
bag
of
money
with
him,
and
will
come
home
at
the
day
appointed.
007:021
With
her
much
fair
speech
she
caused
him
to
yield,
with
the
flattering
of
her
lips
she
forced
him.
007:022
He
goeth
after
her
straightway,
as
an
ox
goeth
to
the
slaughter,
or
as
a
fool
to
the
correction
of
the
stocks;
007:023
Till
a
dart
strike
through
his
liver;
as
a
bird
hasteth
to
the
snare,
and
knoweth
not
that
it
is
for
his
life.
007:024
Hearken
unto
me
now
therefore,
O
ye
children,
and
attend
to
the
words
of
my
mouth.
007:025
Let
not
thine
heart
decline
to
her
ways,
go
not
astray
in
her
paths.
007:026
For
she
hath
cast
down
many
wounded:
yea,
many
strong
men
have
been
slain
by
her.
007:027
Her
house
is
the
way
to
hell,
going
down
to
the
chambers
of
death.
008:001
Doth
not
wisdom
cry?
and
understanding
put
forth
her
voice?
008:002
She
standeth
in
the
top
of
high
places,
by
the
way
in
the
places
of
the
paths.
008:003
She
crieth
at
the
gates,
at
the
entry
of
the
city,
at
the
coming
in
at
the
doors.
008:004
Unto
you,
O
men,
I
call;
and
my
voice
is
to
the
sons
of
man.
008:005
O
ye
simple,
understand
wisdom:
and,
ye
fools,
be
ye
of
an
understanding
heart.
008:006
Hear;
for
I
will
speak
of
excellent
things;
and
the
opening
of
my
lips
shall
be
right
things.
008:007
For
my
mouth
shall
speak
truth;
and
wickedness
is
an
abomination
to
my
lips.
008:008
All
the
words
of
my
mouth
are
in
righteousness;
there
is
nothing
froward
or
perverse
in
them.
008:009
They
are
all
plain
to
him
that
understandeth,
and
right
to
them
that
find
knowledge.
008:010
Receive
my
instruction,
and
not
silver;
and
knowledge
rather
than
choice
gold.
008:011
For
wisdom
is
better
than
rubies;
and
all
the
things
that
may
be
desired
are
not
to
be
compared
to
it.
008:012
I
wisdom
dwell
with
prudence,
and
find
out
knowledge
of
witty
inventions.
008:013
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
to
hate
evil:
pride,
and
arrogancy,
and
the
evil
way,
and
the
froward
mouth,
do
I
hate.
008:014
Counsel
is
mine,
and
sound
wisdom:
I
am
understanding;
I
have
strength.
008:015
By
me
kings
reign,
and
princes
decree
justice.
008:016
By
me
princes
rule,
and
nobles,
even
all
the
judges
of
the
earth.
008:017
I
love
them
that
love
me;
and
those
that
seek
me
early
shall
find
me.
008:018
Riches
and
honour
are
with
me;
yea,
durable
riches
and
righteousness.
008:019
My
fruit
is
better
than
gold,
yea,
than
fine
gold;
and
my
revenue
than
choice
silver.
008:020
I
lead
in
the
way
of
righteousness,
in
the
midst
of
the
paths
of
judgment:
008:021
That
I
may
cause
those
that
love
me
to
inherit
substance;
and
I
will
fill
their
treasures.
008:022
The
LORD
possessed
me
in
the
beginning
of
his
way,
before
his
works
of
old.
008:023
I
was
set
up
from
everlasting,
from
the
beginning,
or
ever
the
earth
was.
008:024
When
there
were
no
depths,
I
was
brought
forth;
when
there
were
no
fountains
abounding
with
water.
008:025
Before
the
mountains
were
settled,
before
the
hills
was
I
brought
forth:
008:026
While
as
yet
he
had
not
made
the
earth,
nor
the
fields,
nor
the
highest
part
of
the
dust
of
the
world.
008:027
When
he
prepared
the
heavens,
I
was
there:
when
he
set
a
compass
upon
the
face
of
the
depth:
008:028
When
he
established
the
clouds
above:
when
he
strengthened
the
fountains
of
the
deep:
008:029
When
he
gave
to
the
sea
his
decree,
that
the
waters
should
not
pass
his
commandment:
when
he
appointed
the
foundations
of
the
earth:
008:030
Then
I
was
by
him,
as
one
brought
up
with
him:
and
I
was
daily
his
delight,
rejoicing
always
before
him;
008:031
Rejoicing
in
the
habitable
part
of
his
earth;
and
my
delights
were
with
the
sons
of
men.
008:032
Now
therefore
hearken
unto
me,
O
ye
children:
for
blessed
are
they
that
keep
my
ways.
008:033
Hear
instruction,
and
be
wise,
and
refuse
it
not.
008:034
Blessed
is
the
man
that
heareth
me,
watching
daily
at
my
gates,
waiting
at
the
posts
of
my
doors.
008:035
For
whoso
findeth
me
findeth
life,
and
shall
obtain
favour
of
the
LORD.
008:036
But
he
that
sinneth
against
me
wrongeth
his
own
soul:
all
they
that
hate
me
love
death.
009:001
Wisdom
hath
builded
her
house,
she
hath
hewn
out
her
seven
pillars:
009:002
She
hath
killed
her
beasts;
she
hath
mingled
her
wine;
she
hath
also
furnished
her
table.
009:003
She
hath
sent
forth
her
maidens:
she
crieth
upon
the
highest
places
of
the
city,
009:004
Whoso
is
simple,
let
him
turn
in
hither:
as
for
him
that
wanteth
understanding,
she
saith
to
him,
009:005
Come,
eat
of
my
bread,
and
drink
of
the
wine
which
I
have
mingled.
009:006
Forsake
the
foolish,
and
live;
and
go
in
the
way
of
understanding.
009:007
He
that
reproveth
a
scorner
getteth
to
himself
shame:
and
he
that
rebuketh
a
wicked
man
getteth
himself
a
blot.
009:008
Reprove
not
a
scorner,
lest
he
hate
thee:
rebuke
a
wise
man,
and
he
will
love
thee.
009:009
Give
instruction
to
a
wise
man,
and
he
will
be
yet
wiser:
teach
a
just
man,
and
he
will
increase
in
learning.
009:010
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom:
and
the
knowledge
of
the
holy
is
understanding.
009:011
For
by
me
thy
days
shall
be
multiplied,
and
the
years
of
thy
life
shall
be
increased.
009:012
If
thou
be
wise,
thou
shalt
be
wise
for
thyself:
but
if
thou
scornest,
thou
alone
shalt
bear
it.
009:013
A
foolish
woman
is
clamorous:
she
is
simple,
and
knoweth
nothing.
009:014
For
she
sitteth
at
the
door
of
her
house,
on
a
seat
in
the
high
places
of
the
city,
009:015
To
call
passengers
who
go
right
on
