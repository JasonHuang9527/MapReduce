their
ways:
009:016
Whoso
is
simple,
let
him
turn
in
hither:
and
as
for
him
that
wanteth
understanding,
she
saith
to
him,
009:017
Stolen
waters
are
sweet,
and
bread
eaten
in
secret
is
pleasant.
009:018
But
he
knoweth
not
that
the
dead
are
there;
and
that
her
guests
are
in
the
depths
of
hell.
010:001
The
proverbs
of
Solomon.
A
wise
son
maketh
a
glad
father:
but
a
foolish
son
is
the
heaviness
of
his
mother.
010:002
Treasures
of
wickedness
profit
nothing:
but
righteousness
delivereth
from
death.
010:003
The
LORD
will
not
suffer
the
soul
of
the
righteous
to
famish:
but
he
casteth
away
the
substance
of
the
wicked.
010:004
He
becometh
poor
that
dealeth
with
a
slack
hand:
but
the
hand
of
the
diligent
maketh
rich.
010:005
He
that
gathereth
in
summer
is
a
wise
son:
but
he
that
sleepeth
in
harvest
is
a
son
that
causeth
shame.
010:006
Blessings
are
upon
the
head
of
the
just:
but
violence
covereth
the
mouth
of
the
wicked.
010:007
The
memory
of
the
just
is
blessed:
but
the
name
of
the
wicked
shall
rot.
010:008
The
wise
in
heart
will
receive
commandments:
but
a
prating
fool
shall
fall.
010:009
He
that
walketh
uprightly
walketh
surely:
but
he
that
perverteth
his
ways
shall
be
known.
010:010
He
that
winketh
with
the
eye
causeth
sorrow:
but
a
prating
fool
shall
fall.
010:011
The
mouth
of
a
righteous
man
is
a
well
of
life:
but
violence
covereth
the
mouth
of
the
wicked.
010:012
Hatred
stirreth
up
strifes:
but
love
covereth
all
sins.
010:013
In
the
lips
of
him
that
hath
understanding
wisdom
is
found:
but
a
rod
is
for
the
back
of
him
that
is
void
of
understanding.
010:014
Wise
men
lay
up
knowledge:
but
the
mouth
of
the
foolish
is
near
destruction.
010:015
The
rich
man's
wealth
is
his
strong
city:
the
destruction
of
the
poor
is
their
poverty.
010:016
The
labour
of
the
righteous
tendeth
to
life:
the
fruit
of
the
wicked
to
sin.
010:017
He
is
in
the
way
of
life
that
keepeth
instruction:
but
he
that
refuseth
reproof
erreth.
010:018
He
that
hideth
hatred
with
lying
lips,
and
he
that
uttereth
a
slander,
is
a
fool.
010:019
In
the
multitude
of
words
there
wanteth
not
sin:
but
he
that
refraineth
his
lips
is
wise.
010:020
The
tongue
of
the
just
is
as
choice
silver:
the
heart
of
the
wicked
is
little
worth.
010:021
The
lips
of
the
righteous
feed
many:
but
fools
die
for
want
of
wisdom.
010:022
The
blessing
of
the
LORD,
it
maketh
rich,
and
he
addeth
no
sorrow
with
it.
010:023
It
is
as
sport
to
a
fool
to
do
mischief:
but
a
man
of
understanding
hath
wisdom.
010:024
The
fear
of
the
wicked,
it
shall
come
upon
him:
but
the
desire
of
the
righteous
shall
be
granted.
010:025
As
the
whirlwind
passeth,
so
is
the
wicked
no
more:
but
the
righteous
is
an
everlasting
foundation.
010:026
As
vinegar
to
the
teeth,
and
as
smoke
to
the
eyes,
so
is
the
sluggard
to
them
that
send
him.
010:027
The
fear
of
the
LORD
prolongeth
days:
but
the
years
of
the
wicked
shall
be
shortened.
010:028
The
hope
of
the
righteous
shall
be
gladness:
but
the
expectation
of
the
wicked
shall
perish.
010:029
The
way
of
the
LORD
is
strength
to
the
upright:
but
destruction
shall
be
to
the
workers
of
iniquity.
010:030
The
righteous
shall
never
be
removed:
but
the
wicked
shall
not
inhabit
the
earth.
010:031
The
mouth
of
the
just
bringeth
forth
wisdom:
but
the
froward
tongue
shall
be
cut
out.
010:032
The
lips
of
the
righteous
know
what
is
acceptable:
but
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
speaketh
frowardness.
011:001
A
false
balance
is
abomination
to
the
LORD:
but
a
just
weight
is
his
delight.
011:002
When
pride
cometh,
then
cometh
shame:
but
with
the
lowly
is
wisdom.
011:003
The
integrity
of
the
upright
shall
guide
them:
but
the
perverseness
of
transgressors
shall
destroy
them.
011:004
Riches
profit
not
in
the
day
of
wrath:
but
righteousness
delivereth
from
death.
011:005
The
righteousness
of
the
perfect
shall
direct
his
way:
but
the
wicked
shall
fall
by
his
own
wickedness.
011:006
The
righteousness
of
the
upright
shall
deliver
them:
but
transgressors
shall
be
taken
in
their
own
naughtiness.
011:007
When
a
wicked
man
dieth,
his
expectation
shall
perish:
and
the
hope
of
unjust
men
perisheth.
011:008
The
righteous
is
delivered
out
of
trouble,
and
the
wicked
cometh
in
his
stead.
011:009
An
hypocrite
with
his
mouth
destroyeth
his
neighbour:
but
through
knowledge
shall
the
just
be
delivered.
011:010
When
it
goeth
well
with
the
righteous,
the
city
rejoiceth:
and
when
the
wicked
perish,
there
is
shouting.
011:011
By
the
blessing
of
the
upright
the
city
is
exalted:
but
it
is
overthrown
by
the
mouth
of
the
wicked.
011:012
He
that
is
void
of
wisdom
despiseth
his
neighbour:
but
a
man
of
understanding
holdeth
his
peace.
011:013
A
talebearer
revealeth
secrets:
but
he
that
is
of
a
faithful
spirit
concealeth
the
matter.
011:014
Where
no
counsel
is,
the
people
fall:
but
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
there
is
safety.
011:015
He
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger
shall
smart
for
it:
and
he
that
hateth
suretiship
is
sure.
011:016
A
gracious
woman
retaineth
honour:
and
strong
men
retain
riches.
011:017
The
merciful
man
doeth
good
to
his
own
soul:
but
he
that
is
cruel
troubleth
his
own
flesh.
011:018
The
wicked
worketh
a
deceitful
work:
but
to
him
that
soweth
righteousness
shall
be
a
sure
reward.
011:019
As
righteousness
tendeth
to
life:
so
he
that
pursueth
evil
pursueth
it
to
his
own
death.
011:020
They
that
are
of
a
froward
heart
are
abomination
to
the
LORD:
but
such
as
are
upright
in
their
way
are
his
delight.
011:021
Though
hand
join
in
hand,
the
wicked
shall
not
be
unpunished:
but
the
seed
of
the
righteous
shall
be
delivered.
011:022
As
a
jewel
of
gold
in
a
swine's
snout,
so
is
a
fair
woman
which
is
without
discretion.
011:023
The
desire
of
the
righteous
is
only
good:
but
the
expectation
of
the
wicked
is
wrath.
011:024
There
is
that
scattereth,
and
yet
increaseth;
and
there
is
that
withholdeth
more
than
is
meet,
but
it
tendeth
to
poverty.
011:025
The
liberal
soul
shall
be
made
fat:
and
he
that
watereth
shall
be
watered
also
himself.
011:026
He
that
withholdeth
corn,
the
people
shall
curse
him:
but
blessing
shall
be
upon
the
head
of
him
that
selleth
it.
011:027
He
that
diligently
seeketh
good
procureth
favour:
but
he
that
seeketh
mischief,
it
shall
come
unto
him.
011:028
He
that
trusteth
in
his
riches
shall
fall;
but
the
righteous
shall
flourish
as
a
branch.
011:029
He
that
troubleth
his
own
house
shall
inherit
the
wind:
and
the
fool
shall
be
servant
to
the
wise
of
heart.
011:030
The
fruit
of
the
righteous
is
a
tree
of
life;
and
he
that
winneth
souls
is
wise.
011:031
Behold,
the
righteous
shall
be
recompensed
in
the
earth:
much
more
the
wicked
and
the
sinner.
012:001
Whoso
loveth
instruction
loveth
knowledge:
but
he
that
hateth
reproof
is
brutish.
012:002
A
good
man
obtaineth
favour
of
the
LORD:
but
a
man
of
wicked
devices
will
he
condemn.
012:003
A
man
shall
not
be
established
by
wickedness:
but
the
root
of
the
righteous
shall
not
be
moved.
012:004
A
virtuous
woman
is
a
crown
to
her
husband:
but
she
that
maketh
ashamed
is
as
rottenness
in
his
bones.
012:005
The
thoughts
of
the
righteous
are
right:
but
the
counsels
of
the
wicked
are
deceit.
012:006
The
words
of
the
wicked
are
to
lie
in
wait
for
blood:
but
the
mouth
of
the
upright
shall
deliver
them.
012:007
The
wicked
are
overthrown,
and
are
not:
but
the
house
of
the
righteous
shall
stand.
012:008
A
man
shall
be
commended
according
to
his
wisdom:
but
he
that
is
of
a
perverse
heart
shall
be
despised.
012:009
He
that
is
despised,
and
hath
a
servant,
is
better
than
he
that
honoureth
himself,
and
lacketh
bread.
012:010
A
righteous
man
regardeth
the
life
of
his
beast:
but
the
tender
mercies
of
the
wicked
are
cruel.
012:011
He
that
tilleth
his
land
shall
be
satisfied
with
bread:
but
he
that
followeth
vain
persons
is
void
of
understanding.
012:012
The
wicked
desireth
the
net
of
evil
men:
but
the
root
of
the
righteous
yieldeth
fruit.
012:013
The
wicked
is
snared
by
the
transgression
of
his
lips:
but
the
just
shall
come
out
of
trouble.
012:014
A
man
shall
be
satisfied
with
good
by
the
fruit
of
his
mouth:
and
the
recompence
of
a
man's
hands
shall
be
rendered
unto
him.
012:015
The
way
of
a
fool
is
right
in
his
own
eyes:
but
he
that
hearkeneth
unto
counsel
is
wise.
012:016
A
fool's
wrath
is
presently
known:
but
a
prudent
man
covereth
shame.
012:017
He
that
speaketh
truth
sheweth
forth
righteousness:
but
a
false
witness
deceit.
012:018
There
is
that
speaketh
like
the
piercings
of
a
sword:
but
the
tongue
of
the
wise
is
health.
012:019
The
lip
of
truth
shall
be
established
for
ever:
but
a
lying
tongue
is
but
for
a
moment.
012:020
Deceit
is
in
the
heart
of
them
that
imagine
evil:
but
to
the
counsellors
of
peace
is
joy.
012:021
There
shall
no
evil
happen
to
the
just:
but
the
wicked
shall
be
filled
with
mischief.
012:022
Lying
lips
are
abomination
to
the
LORD:
but
they
that
deal
truly
are
his
delight.
012:023
A
prudent
man
concealeth
knowledge:
but
the
heart
of
fools
proclaimeth
foolishness.
012:024
The
hand
of
the
diligent
shall
bear
rule:
but
the
slothful
shall
be
under
tribute.
012:025
Heaviness
in
the
heart
of
man
maketh
it
stoop:
but
a
good
word
maketh
it
glad.
012:026
The
righteous
is
more
excellent
than
his
neighbour:
but
the
way
of
the
wicked
seduceth
them.
012:027
The
slothful
man
roasteth
not
that
which
he
took
in
hunting:
but
the
substance
of
a
diligent
man
is
precious.
012:028
In
the
way
of
righteousness
is
life:
and
in
the
pathway
thereof
there
is
no
death.
013:001
A
wise
son
heareth
his
father's
instruction:
but
a
scorner
heareth
not
rebuke.
013:002
A
man
shall
eat
good
by
the
fruit
of
his
mouth:
but
the
soul
of
the
transgressors
shall
eat
violence.
013:003
He
that
keepeth
his
mouth
keepeth
his
life:
but
he
that
openeth
wide
his
lips
shall
have
destruction.
013:004
The
soul
of
the
sluggard
desireth,
and
hath
nothing:
but
the
soul
of
the
diligent
shall
be
made
fat.
013:005
A
righteous
man
hateth
lying:
but
a
wicked
man
is
loathsome,
and
cometh
to
shame.
013:006
Righteousness
keepeth
him
that
is
upright
in
the
way:
but
wickedness
overthroweth
the
sinner.
013:007
There
is
that
maketh
himself
rich,
yet
hath
nothing:
there
is
that
maketh
himself
poor,
yet
hath
great
riches.
013:008
The
ransom
of
a
man's
life
are
his
riches:
but
the
poor
heareth
not
rebuke.
013:009
The
light
of
the
righteous
rejoiceth:
but
the
lamp
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out.
013:010
Only
by
pride
cometh
contention:
but
with
the
well
advised
is
wisdom.
013:011
Wealth
gotten
by
vanity
shall
be
diminished:
but
he
that
gathereth
by
labour
shall
increase.
013:012
Hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick:
but
when
the
desire
cometh,
it
is
a
tree
of
life.
013:013
Whoso
despiseth
the
word
shall
be
destroyed:
but
he
that
feareth
the
commandment
shall
be
rewarded.
013:014
The
law
of
the
wise
is
a
fountain
of
life,
to
depart
from
the
snares
of
death.
013:015
Good
understanding
giveth
favour:
but
the
way
of
transgressors
is
hard.
013:016
Every
prudent
man
dealeth
with
knowledge:
but
a
fool
layeth
open
his
folly.
013:017
A
wicked
messenger
falleth
into
mischief:
but
a
faithful
ambassador
is
health.
013:018
Poverty
and
shame
shall
be
to
him
that
refuseth
instruction:
but
he
that
regardeth
reproof
shall
be
honoured.
013:019
The
desire
accomplished
is
sweet
to
the
soul:
but
it
is
abomination
to
fools
to
depart
from
evil.
013:020
He
that
walketh
with
wise
men
shall
be
wise:
but
a
companion
of
fools
shall
be
destroyed.
013:021
Evil
pursueth
sinners:
but
to
the
righteous
good
shall
be
repayed.
013:022
A
good
man
leaveth
an
inheritance
to
his
children's
children:
and
the
wealth
of
the
sinner
is
laid
up
for
the
just.
013:023
Much
food
is
in
the
tillage
of
the
poor:
but
there
is
that
is
destroyed
for
want
of
judgment.
013:024
He
that
spareth
his
rod
hateth
his
son:
but
he
that
loveth
him
chasteneth
him
betimes.
013:025
The
righteous
eateth
to
the
satisfying
of
his
soul:
but
the
belly
of
the
wicked
shall
want.
014:001
Every
wise
woman
buildeth
her
house:
but
the
foolish
plucketh
it
down
with
her
hands.
014:002
He
that
walketh
in
his
uprightness
feareth
the
LORD:
but
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways
despiseth
him.
014:003
In
the
mouth
of
the
foolish
is
a
rod
of
pride:
but
the
lips
of
the
wise
shall
preserve
them.
014:004
Where
no
oxen
are,
the
crib
is
clean:
but
much
increase
is
by
the
strength
of
the
ox.
014:005
A
faithful
witness
will
not
lie:
but
a
false
witness
will
utter
lies.
014:006
A
scorner
seeketh
wisdom,
and
findeth
it
not:
but
knowledge
is
easy
unto
him
that
understandeth.
014:007
Go
from
the
presence
of
a
foolish
man,
when
thou
perceivest
not
in
him
the
lips
of
knowledge.
014:008
The
wisdom
of
the
prudent
is
to
understand
his
way:
but
the
folly
of
fools
is
deceit.
014:009
Fools
make
a
mock
at
sin:
but
among
the
righteous
there
is
favour.
014:010
The
heart
knoweth
his
own
bitterness;
and
a
stranger
doth
not
intermeddle
with
his
joy.
014:011
The
house
of
the
wicked
shall
be
overthrown:
but
the
tabernacle
of
the
upright
shall
flourish.
014:012
There
is
a
way
which
seemeth
right
unto
a
man,
but
the
end
thereof
are
the
ways
of
death.
014:013
Even
in
laughter
the
heart
is
sorrowful;
and
the
end
of
that
mirth
is
heaviness.
014:014
The
backslider
in
heart
shall
be
filled
with
his
own
ways:
and
a
good
man
shall
be
satisfied
from
himself.
014:015
The
simple
believeth
every
word:
but
the
prudent
man
looketh
well
to
his
going.
014:016
A
wise
man
feareth,
and
departeth
from
evil:
but
the
fool
rageth,
and
is
confident.
014:017
He
that
is
soon
angry
dealeth
foolishly:
and
a
man
of
wicked
devices
is
hated.
014:018
The
simple
inherit
folly:
but
the
prudent
are
crowned
with
knowledge.
014:019
The
evil
bow
before
the
good;
and
the
wicked
at
the
gates
of
the
righteous.
014:020
The
poor
is
hated
even
of
his
own
neighbour:
but
the
rich
hath
many
friends.
014:021
He
that
despiseth
his
neighbour
sinneth:
but
he
that
hath
mercy
on
the
poor,
happy
is
he.
014:022
Do
they
not
err
that
devise
evil?
but
mercy
and
truth
shall
be
to
them
that
devise
good.
014:023
In
all
labour
there
is
profit:
but
the
talk
of
the
lips
tendeth
only
to
penury.
014:024
The
crown
of
the
wise
is
their
riches:
but
the
foolishness
of
fools
is
folly.
014:025
A
true
witness
delivereth
souls:
but
a
deceitful
witness
speaketh
lies.
014:026
In
the
fear
of
the
LORD
is
strong
confidence:
and
his
children
shall
have
a
place
of
refuge.
014:027
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
a
fountain
of
life,
to
depart
from
the
snares
of
death.
014:028
In
the
multitude
of
people
is
the
king's
honour:
but
in
the
want
of
people
is
the
destruction
of
the
prince.
014:029
He
that
is
slow
to
wrath
is
of
great
understanding:
but
he
that
is
hasty
of
spirit
exalteth
folly.
014:030
A
sound
heart
is
the
life
of
the
flesh:
but
envy
the
rottenness
of
the
bones.
014:031
He
that
oppresseth
the
poor
reproacheth
his
Maker:
but
he
that
honoureth
him
hath
mercy
on
the
poor.
014:032
The
wicked
is
driven
away
in
his
wickedness:
but
the
righteous
hath
hope
in
his
death.
014:033
Wisdom
resteth
in
the
heart
of
him
that
hath
understanding:
but
that
which
is
in
the
midst
of
fools
is
made
known.
014:034
Righteousness
exalteth
a
nation:
but
sin
is
a
reproach
to
any
people.
014:035
The
king's
favour
is
toward
a
wise
servant:
but
his
wrath
is
against
him
that
causeth
shame.
015:001
A
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath:
but
grievous
words
stir
up
anger.
015:002
The
tongue
of
the
wise
useth
knowledge
aright:
but
the
mouth
of
fools
poureth
out
foolishness.
015:003
The
eyes
of
the
LORD
are
in
every
place,
beholding
the
evil
and
the
good.
015:004
A
wholesome
tongue
is
a
tree
of
life:
but
perverseness
therein
is
a
breach
in
the
spirit.
015:005
A
fool
despiseth
his
father's
instruction:
but
he
that
regardeth
reproof
is
prudent.
015:006
In
the
house
of
the
righteous
is
much
treasure:
but
in
the
revenues
of
the
wicked
is
trouble.
015:007
The
lips
of
the
wise
disperse
knowledge:
but
the
heart
of
the
foolish
doeth
not
so.
015:008
The
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
to
the
LORD:
but
the
prayer
of
the
upright
is
his
delight.
015:009
The
way
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
unto
the
LORD:
but
he
loveth
him
that
followeth
after
righteousness.
015:010
Correction
is
grievous
unto
him
that
forsaketh
the
way:
and
he
that
hateth
reproof
shall
die.
015:011
Hell
and
destruction
are
before
the
LORD:
how
much
more
then
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men?
015:012
A
scorner
loveth
not
one
that
reproveth
him:
neither
will
he
go
unto
the
wise.
015:013
A
merry
heart
maketh
a
cheerful
countenance:
but
by
sorrow
of
the
heart
the
spirit
is
broken.
015:014
The
heart
of
him
that
hath
understanding
seeketh
knowledge:
but
the
mouth
of
fools
feedeth
on
foolishness.
015:015
All
the
days
of
the
afflicted
are
evil:
but
he
that
is
of
a
merry
heart
hath
a
continual
feast.
015:016
Better
is
little
with
the
fear
of
the
LORD
than
great
treasure
and
trouble
therewith.
015:017
Better
is
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is,
than
a
stalled
ox
and
hatred
therewith.
015:018
A
wrathful
man
stirreth
up
strife:
but
he
that
is
slow
to
anger
appeaseth
strife.
015:019
The
way
of
the
slothful
man
is
as
an
hedge
of
thorns:
but
the
way
of
the
righteous
is
made
plain.
015:020
A
wise
son
maketh
a
glad
father:
but
a
foolish
man
despiseth
his
mother.
015:021
Folly
is
joy
to
him
that
is
destitute
of
wisdom:
but
a
man
of
understanding
walketh
uprightly.
015:022
Without
counsel
purposes
are
disappointed:
but
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
they
are
established.
015:023
A
man
hath
joy
by
the
answer
of
his
mouth:
and
a
word
spoken
in
due
season,
how
good
is
it!
015:024
The
way
of
life
is
above
to
the
wise,
that
he
may
depart
from
hell
beneath.
015:025
The
LORD
will
destroy
the
house
of
the
proud:
but
he
will
establish
the
border
of
the
widow.
015:026
The
thoughts
of
the
wicked
are
an
abomination
to
the
LORD:
but
the
words
of
the
pure
are
pleasant
words.
015:027
He
that
is
greedy
of
gain
troubleth
his
own
house;
but
he
that
hateth
gifts
shall
live.
015:028
The
heart
of
the
righteous
studieth
to
answer:
but
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
poureth
out
evil
things.
015:029
The
LORD
is
far
from
the
wicked:
but
he
heareth
the
prayer
of
the
righteous.
015:030
The
light
of
the
eyes
rejoiceth
the
heart:
and
a
good
report
maketh
the
bones
fat.
015:031
The
ear
that
heareth
the
reproof
of
life
abideth
among
the
wise.
015:032
He
that
refuseth
instruction
despiseth
his
own
soul:
but
he
that
heareth
reproof
getteth
understanding.
015:033
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
the
instruction
of
wisdom;
and
before
honour
is
humility.
016:001
The
preparations
of
the
heart
in
man,
and
the
answer
of
the
tongue,
is
from
the
LORD.
016:002
All
the
ways
of
a
man
are
clean
in
his
own
eyes;
but
the
LORD
weigheth
the
spirits.
016:003
Commit
thy
works
unto
the
LORD,
and
thy
thoughts
shall
be
established.
016:004
The
LORD
hath
made
all
things
for
himself:
yea,
even
the
wicked
for
the
day
of
evil.
016:005
Every
one
that
is
proud
in
heart
is
an
abomination
to
the
LORD:
though
hand
join
in
hand,
he
shall
not
be
unpunished.
016:006
By
mercy
and
truth
iniquity
is
purged:
and
by
the
fear
of
the
LORD
men
depart
from
evil.
016:007
When
a
man's
ways
please
the
LORD,
he
maketh
even
his
enemies
to
be
at
peace
with
him.
016:008
Better
is
a
little
with
righteousness
than
great
revenues
without
right.
016:009
A
man's
heart
deviseth
his
way:
but
the
LORD
directeth
his
steps.
016:010
A
divine
sentence
is
in
the
lips
of
the
king:
his
mouth
transgresseth
not
in
judgment.
016:011
A
just
weight
and
balance
are
the
LORD's:
all
the
weights
of
the
bag
are
his
work.
016:012
It
is
an
abomination
to
kings
to
commit
wickedness:
for
the
throne
is
established
by
righteousness.
016:013
Righteous
lips
are
the
delight
of
kings;
and
they
love
him
that
speaketh
right.
016:014
The
wrath
of
a
king
is
as
messengers
of
death:
but
a
wise
man
will
pacify
it.
016:015
In
the
light
of
the
king's
countenance
is
life;
and
his
favour
is
as
a
cloud
of
the
latter
rain.
016:016
How
much
better
is
it
to
get
wisdom
than
gold!
and
to
get
understanding
rather
to
be
chosen
than
silver!
016:017
The
highway
of
the
upright
is
to
depart
from
evil:
he
that
keepeth
his
way
preserveth
his
soul.
016:018
Pride
goeth
before
destruction,
and
an
haughty
spirit
before
a
fall.
016:019
Better
it
is
to
be
of
an
humble
spirit
with
the
lowly,
than
to
divide
the
spoil
with
the
proud.
016:020
He
that
handleth
a
matter
wisely
shall
find
good:
and
whoso
trusteth
in
the
LORD,
happy
is
he.
016:021
The
wise
in
heart
shall
be
called
prudent:
and
the
sweetness
of
the
lips
increaseth
learning.
016:022
Understanding
is
a
wellspring
of
life
unto
him
that
hath
it:
but
the
instruction
of
fools
is
folly.
016:023
The
heart
of
the
wise
teacheth
his
mouth,
and
addeth
learning
to
his
lips.
016:024
Pleasant
words
are
as
an
honeycomb,
sweet
to
the
soul,
and
health
to
the
bones.
016:025
There
is
a
way
that
seemeth
right
unto
a
man,
but
the
end
thereof
are
the
ways
of
death.
016:026
He
that
laboureth
laboureth
for
himself;
for
his
mouth
craveth
it
of
him.
016:027
An
ungodly
man
diggeth
up
evil:
and
in
his
lips
there
is
as
a
burning
fire.
016:028
A
froward
man
soweth
strife:
and
a
whisperer
separateth
chief
friends.
016:029
A
violent
man
enticeth
his
neighbour,
and
leadeth
him
into
the
way
that
is
not
good.
016:030
He
shutteth
his
eyes
to
devise
froward
things:
moving
his
lips
he
bringeth
evil
to
pass.
016:031
The
hoary
head
is
a
crown
of
glory,
if
it
be
found
in
the
way
of
righteousness.
016:032
He
that
is
slow
to
anger
is
better
than
the
mighty;
and
he
that
ruleth
his
spirit
than
he
that
taketh
a
city.
016:033
The
lot
is
cast
into
the
lap;
but
the
whole
disposing
thereof
is
of
the
LORD.
017:001
Better
is
a
dry
morsel,
and
quietness
therewith,
than
an
house
full
of
sacrifices
with
strife.
017:002
A
wise
servant
shall
have
rule
over
a
son
that
causeth
shame,
and
shall
have
part
of
the
inheritance
among
the
brethren.
017:003
The
fining
pot
is
for
silver,
and
the
furnace
for
gold:
but
the
LORD
trieth
the
hearts.
017:004
A
wicked
doer
giveth
heed
to
false
lips;
and
a
liar
giveth
ear
to
a
naughty
tongue.
017:005
Whoso
mocketh
the
poor
reproacheth
his
Maker:
and
he
that
is
glad
at
calamities
shall
not
be
unpunished.
017:006
Children's
children
are
the
crown
of
old
men;
and
the
glory
of
children
are
their
fathers.
017:007
Excellent
speech
becometh
not
a
fool:
much
less
do
lying
lips
a
prince.
017:008
A
gift
is
as
a
precious
stone
in
the
eyes
of
him
that
hath
it:
whithersoever
it
turneth,
it
prospereth.
017:009
He
that
covereth
a
transgression
seeketh
love;
but
he
that
repeateth
a
matter
separateth
very
friends.
017:010
A
reproof
entereth
more
into
a
wise
man
than
an
hundred
stripes
into
a
fool.
017:011
An
evil
man
seeketh
only
rebellion:
therefore
a
cruel
messenger
shall
be
sent
against
him.
017:012
Let
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
meet
a
man,
rather
than
a
fool
in
his
folly.
017:013
Whoso
rewardeth
evil
for
good,
evil
shall
not
depart
from
his
house.
017:014
The
beginning
of
strife
is
as
when
one
letteth
out
water:
