therefore
leave
off
contention,
before
it
be
meddled
with.
017:015
He
that
justifieth
the
wicked,
and
he
that
condemneth
the
just,
even
they
both
are
abomination
to
the
LORD.
017:016
Wherefore
is
there
a
price
in
the
hand
of
a
fool
to
get
wisdom,
seeing
he
hath
no
heart
to
it?
017:017
A
friend
loveth
at
all
times,
and
a
brother
is
born
for
adversity.
017:018
A
man
void
of
understanding
striketh
hands,
and
becometh
surety
in
the
presence
of
his
friend.
017:019
He
loveth
transgression
that
loveth
strife:
and
he
that
exalteth
his
gate
seeketh
destruction.
017:020
He
that
hath
a
froward
heart
findeth
no
good:
and
he
that
hath
a
perverse
tongue
falleth
into
mischief.
017:021
He
that
begetteth
a
fool
doeth
it
to
his
sorrow:
and
the
father
of
a
fool
hath
no
joy.
017:022
A
merry
heart
doeth
good
like
a
medicine:
but
a
broken
spirit
drieth
the
bones.
017:023
A
wicked
man
taketh
a
gift
out
of
the
bosom
to
pervert
the
ways
of
judgment.
017:024
Wisdom
is
before
him
that
hath
understanding;
but
the
eyes
of
a
fool
are
in
the
ends
of
the
earth.
017:025
A
foolish
son
is
a
grief
to
his
father,
and
bitterness
to
her
that
bare
him.
017:026
Also
to
punish
the
just
is
not
good,
nor
to
strike
princes
for
equity.
017:027
He
that
hath
knowledge
spareth
his
words:
and
a
man
of
understanding
is
of
an
excellent
spirit.
017:028
Even
a
fool,
when
he
holdeth
his
peace,
is
counted
wise:
and
he
that
shutteth
his
lips
is
esteemed
a
man
of
understanding.
018:001
Through
desire
a
man,
having
separated
himself,
seeketh
and
intermeddleth
with
all
wisdom.
018:002
A
fool
hath
no
delight
in
understanding,
but
that
his
heart
may
discover
itself.
018:003
When
the
wicked
cometh,
then
cometh
also
contempt,
and
with
ignominy
reproach.
018:004
The
words
of
a
man's
mouth
are
as
deep
waters,
and
the
wellspring
of
wisdom
as
a
flowing
brook.
018:005
It
is
not
good
to
accept
the
person
of
the
wicked,
to
overthrow
the
righteous
in
judgment.
018:006
A
fool's
lips
enter
into
contention,
and
his
mouth
calleth
for
strokes.
018:007
A
fool's
mouth
is
his
destruction,
and
his
lips
are
the
snare
of
his
soul.
018:008
The
words
of
a
talebearer
are
as
wounds,
and
they
go
down
into
the
innermost
parts
of
the
belly.
018:009
He
also
that
is
slothful
in
his
work
is
brother
to
him
that
is
a
great
waster.
018:010
The
name
of
the
LORD
is
a
strong
tower:
the
righteous
runneth
into
it,
and
is
safe.
018:011
The
rich
man's
wealth
is
his
strong
city,
and
as
an
high
wall
in
his
own
conceit.
018:012
Before
destruction
the
heart
of
man
is
haughty,
and
before
honour
is
humility.
018:013
He
that
answereth
a
matter
before
he
heareth
it,
it
is
folly
and
shame
unto
him.
018:014
The
spirit
of
a
man
will
sustain
his
infirmity;
but
a
wounded
spirit
who
can
bear?
018:015
The
heart
of
the
prudent
getteth
knowledge;
and
the
ear
of
the
wise
seeketh
knowledge.
018:016
A
man's
gift
maketh
room
for
him,
and
bringeth
him
before
great
men.
018:017
He
that
is
first
in
his
own
cause
seemeth
just;
but
his
neighbour
cometh
and
searcheth
him.
018:018
The
lot
causeth
contentions
to
cease,
and
parteth
between
the
mighty.
018:019
A
brother
offended
is
harder
to
be
won
than
a
strong
city:
and
their
contentions
are
like
the
bars
of
a
castle.
018:020
A
man's
belly
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
fruit
of
his
mouth;
and
with
the
increase
of
his
lips
shall
he
be
filled.
018:021
Death
and
life
are
in
the
power
of
the
tongue:
and
they
that
love
it
shall
eat
the
fruit
thereof.
018:022
Whoso
findeth
a
wife
findeth
a
good
thing,
and
obtaineth
favour
of
the
LORD.
018:023
The
poor
useth
intreaties;
but
the
rich
answereth
roughly.
018:024
A
man
that
hath
friends
must
shew
himself
friendly:
and
there
is
a
friend
that
sticketh
closer
than
a
brother.
019:001
Better
is
the
poor
that
walketh
in
his
integrity,
than
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
lips,
and
is
a
fool.
019:002
Also,
that
the
soul
be
without
knowledge,
it
is
not
good;
and
he
that
hasteth
with
his
feet
sinneth.
019:003
The
foolishness
of
man
perverteth
his
way:
and
his
heart
fretteth
against
the
LORD.
019:004
Wealth
maketh
many
friends;
but
the
poor
is
separated
from
his
neighbour.
019:005
A
false
witness
shall
not
be
unpunished,
and
he
that
speaketh
lies
shall
not
escape.
019:006
Many
will
intreat
the
favour
of
the
prince:
and
every
man
is
a
friend
to
him
that
giveth
gifts.
019:007
All
the
brethren
of
the
poor
do
hate
him:
how
much
more
do
his
friends
go
far
from
him?
he
pursueth
them
with
words,
yet
they
are
wanting
to
him.
019:008
He
that
getteth
wisdom
loveth
his
own
soul:
he
that
keepeth
understanding
shall
find
good.
019:009
A
false
witness
shall
not
be
unpunished,
and
he
that
speaketh
lies
shall
perish.
019:010
Delight
is
not
seemly
for
a
fool;
much
less
for
a
servant
to
have
rule
over
princes.
019:011
The
discretion
of
a
man
deferreth
his
anger;
and
it
is
his
glory
to
pass
over
a
transgression.
019:012
The
king's
wrath
is
as
the
roaring
of
a
lion;
but
his
favour
is
as
dew
upon
the
grass.
019:013
A
foolish
son
is
the
calamity
of
his
father:
and
the
contentions
of
a
wife
are
a
continual
dropping.
019:014
House
and
riches
are
the
inheritance
of
fathers:
and
a
prudent
wife
is
from
the
LORD.
019:015
Slothfulness
casteth
into
a
deep
sleep;
and
an
idle
soul
shall
suffer
hunger.
019:016
He
that
keepeth
the
commandment
keepeth
his
own
soul;
but
he
that
despiseth
his
ways
shall
die.
019:017
He
that
hath
pity
upon
the
poor
lendeth
unto
the
LORD;
and
that
which
he
hath
given
will
he
pay
him
again.
019:018
Chasten
thy
son
while
there
is
hope,
and
let
not
thy
soul
spare
for
his
crying.
019:019
A
man
of
great
wrath
shall
suffer
punishment:
for
if
thou
deliver
him,
yet
thou
must
do
it
again.
019:020
Hear
counsel,
and
receive
instruction,
that
thou
mayest
be
wise
in
thy
latter
end.
019:021
There
are
many
devices
in
a
man's
heart;
nevertheless
the
counsel
of
the
LORD,
that
shall
stand.
019:022
The
desire
of
a
man
is
his
kindness:
and
a
poor
man
is
better
than
a
liar.
019:023
The
fear
of
the
LORD
tendeth
to
life:
and
he
that
hath
it
shall
abide
satisfied;
he
shall
not
be
visited
with
evil.
019:024
A
slothful
man
hideth
his
hand
in
his
bosom,
and
will
not
so
much
as
bring
it
to
his
mouth
again.
019:025
Smite
a
scorner,
and
the
simple
will
beware:
and
reprove
one
that
hath
understanding,
and
he
will
understand
knowledge.
019:026
He
that
wasteth
his
father,
and
chaseth
away
his
mother,
is
a
son
that
causeth
shame,
and
bringeth
reproach.
019:027
Cease,
my
son,
to
hear
the
instruction
that
causeth
to
err
from
the
words
of
knowledge.
019:028
An
ungodly
witness
scorneth
judgment:
and
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
devoureth
iniquity.
019:029
Judgments
are
prepared
for
scorners,
and
stripes
for
the
back
of
fools.
020:001
Wine
is
a
mocker,
strong
drink
is
raging:
and
whosoever
is
deceived
thereby
is
not
wise.
020:002
The
fear
of
a
king
is
as
the
roaring
of
a
lion:
whoso
provoketh
him
to
anger
sinneth
against
his
own
soul.
020:003
It
is
an
honour
for
a
man
to
cease
from
strife:
but
every
fool
will
be
meddling.
020:004
The
sluggard
will
not
plow
by
reason
of
the
cold;
therefore
shall
he
beg
in
harvest,
and
have
nothing.
020:005
Counsel
in
the
heart
of
man
is
like
deep
water;
but
a
man
of
understanding
will
draw
it
out.
020:006
Most
men
will
proclaim
every
one
his
own
goodness:
but
a
faithful
man
who
can
find?
020:007
The
just
man
walketh
in
his
integrity:
his
children
are
blessed
after
him.
020:008
A
king
that
sitteth
in
the
throne
of
judgment
scattereth
away
all
evil
with
his
eyes.
020:009
Who
can
say,
I
have
made
my
heart
clean,
I
am
pure
from
my
sin?
020:010
Divers
weights,
and
divers
measures,
both
of
them
are
alike
abomination
to
the
LORD.
020:011
Even
a
child
is
known
by
his
doings,
whether
his
work
be
pure,
and
whether
it
be
right.
020:012
The
hearing
ear,
and
the
seeing
eye,
the
LORD
hath
made
even
both
of
them.
020:013
Love
not
sleep,
lest
thou
come
to
poverty;
open
thine
eyes,
and
thou
shalt
be
satisfied
with
bread.
020:014
It
is
naught,
it
is
naught,
saith
the
buyer:
but
when
he
is
gone
his
way,
then
he
boasteth.
020:015
There
is
gold,
and
a
multitude
of
rubies:
but
the
lips
of
knowledge
are
a
precious
jewel.
020:016
Take
his
garment
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger:
and
take
a
pledge
of
him
for
a
strange
woman.
020:017
Bread
of
deceit
is
sweet
to
a
man;
but
afterwards
his
mouth
shall
be
filled
with
gravel.
020:018
Every
purpose
is
established
by
counsel:
and
with
good
advice
make
war.
020:019
He
that
goeth
about
as
a
talebearer
revealeth
secrets:
therefore
meddle
not
with
him
that
flattereth
with
his
lips.
020:020
Whoso
curseth
his
father
or
his
mother,
his
lamp
shall
be
put
out
in
obscure
darkness.
020:021
An
inheritance
may
be
gotten
hastily
at
the
beginning;
but
the
end
thereof
shall
not
be
blessed.
020:022
Say
not
thou,
I
will
recompense
evil;
but
wait
on
the
LORD,
and
he
shall
save
thee.
020:023
Divers
weights
are
an
abomination
unto
the
LORD;
and
a
false
balance
is
not
good.
020:024
Man's
goings
are
of
the
LORD;
how
can
a
man
then
understand
his
own
way?
020:025
It
is
a
snare
to
the
man
who
devoureth
that
which
is
holy,
and
after
vows
to
make
enquiry.
020:026
A
wise
king
scattereth
the
wicked,
and
bringeth
the
wheel
over
them.
020:027
The
spirit
of
man
is
the
candle
of
the
LORD,
searching
all
the
inward
parts
of
the
belly.
020:028
Mercy
and
truth
preserve
the
king:
and
his
throne
is
upholden
by
mercy.
020:029
The
glory
of
young
men
is
their
strength:
and
the
beauty
of
old
men
is
the
grey
head.
020:030
The
blueness
of
a
wound
cleanseth
away
evil:
so
do
stripes
the
inward
parts
of
the
belly.
021:001
The
king's
heart
is
in
the
hand
of
the
LORD,
as
the
rivers
of
water:
he
turneth
it
whithersoever
he
will.
021:002
Every
way
of
a
man
is
right
in
his
own
eyes:
but
the
LORD
pondereth
the
hearts.
021:003
To
do
justice
and
judgment
is
more
acceptable
to
the
LORD
than
sacrifice.
021:004
An
high
look,
and
a
proud
heart,
and
the
plowing
of
the
wicked,
is
sin.
021:005
The
thoughts
of
the
diligent
tend
only
to
plenteousness;
but
of
every
one
that
is
hasty
only
to
want.
021:006
The
getting
of
treasures
by
a
lying
tongue
is
a
vanity
tossed
to
and
fro
of
them
that
seek
death.
021:007
The
robbery
of
the
wicked
shall
destroy
them;
because
they
refuse
to
do
judgment.
021:008
The
way
of
man
is
froward
and
strange:
but
as
for
the
pure,
his
work
is
right.
021:009
It
is
better
to
dwell
in
a
corner
of
the
housetop,
than
with
a
brawling
woman
in
a
wide
house.
021:010
The
soul
of
the
wicked
desireth
evil:
his
neighbour
findeth
no
favour
in
his
eyes.
021:011
When
the
scorner
is
punished,
the
simple
is
made
wise:
and
when
the
wise
is
instructed,
he
receiveth
knowledge.
021:012
The
righteous
man
wisely
considereth
the
house
of
the
wicked:
but
God
overthroweth
the
wicked
for
their
wickedness.
021:013
Whoso
stoppeth
his
ears
at
the
cry
of
the
poor,
he
also
shall
cry
himself,
but
shall
not
be
heard.
021:014
A
gift
in
secret
pacifieth
anger:
and
a
reward
in
the
bosom
strong
wrath.
021:015
It
is
joy
to
the
just
to
do
judgment:
but
destruction
shall
be
to
the
workers
of
iniquity.
021:016
The
man
that
wandereth
out
of
the
way
of
understanding
shall
remain
in
the
congregation
of
the
dead.
021:017
He
that
loveth
pleasure
shall
be
a
poor
man:
he
that
loveth
wine
and
oil
shall
not
be
rich.
021:018
The
wicked
shall
be
a
ransom
for
the
righteous,
and
the
transgressor
for
the
upright.
021:019
It
is
better
to
dwell
in
the
wilderness,
than
with
a
contentious
and
an
angry
woman.
021:020
There
is
treasure
to
be
desired
and
oil
in
the
dwelling
of
the
wise;
but
a
foolish
man
spendeth
it
up.
021:021
He
that
followeth
after
righteousness
and
mercy
findeth
life,
righteousness,
and
honour.
021:022
A
wise
man
scaleth
the
city
of
the
mighty,
and
casteth
down
the
strength
of
the
confidence
thereof.
021:023
Whoso
keepeth
his
mouth
and
his
tongue
keepeth
his
soul
from
troubles.
021:024
Proud
and
haughty
scorner
is
his
name,
who
dealeth
in
proud
wrath.
021:025
The
desire
of
the
slothful
killeth
him;
for
his
hands
refuse
to
labour.
021:026
He
coveteth
greedily
all
the
day
long:
but
the
righteous
giveth
and
spareth
not.
021:027
The
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
abomination:
how
much
more,
when
he
bringeth
it
with
a
wicked
mind?
021:028
A
false
witness
shall
perish:
but
the
man
that
heareth
speaketh
constantly.
021:029
A
wicked
man
hardeneth
his
face:
but
as
for
the
upright,
he
directeth
his
way.
021:030
There
is
no
wisdom
nor
understanding
nor
counsel
against
the
LORD.
021:031
The
horse
is
prepared
against
the
day
of
battle:
but
safety
is
of
the
LORD.
022:001
A
GOOD
name
is
rather
to
be
chosen
than
great
riches,
and
loving
favour
rather
than
silver
and
gold.
022:002
The
rich
and
poor
meet
together:
the
LORD
is
the
maker
of
them
all.
022:003
A
prudent
man
foreseeth
the
evil,
and
hideth
himself:
but
the
simple
pass
on,
and
are
punished.
022:004
By
humility
and
the
fear
of
the
LORD
are
riches,
and
honour,
and
life.
022:005
Thorns
and
snares
are
in
the
way
of
the
froward:
he
that
doth
keep
his
soul
shall
be
far
from
them.
022:006
Train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go:
and
when
he
is
old,
he
will
not
depart
from
it.
022:007
The
rich
ruleth
over
the
poor,
and
the
borrower
is
servant
to
the
lender.
022:008
He
that
soweth
iniquity
shall
reap
vanity:
and
the
rod
of
his
anger
shall
fail.
022:009
He
that
hath
a
bountiful
eye
shall
be
blessed;
for
he
giveth
of
his
bread
to
the
poor.
022:010
Cast
out
the
scorner,
and
contention
shall
go
out;
yea,
strife
and
reproach
shall
cease.
022:011
He
that
loveth
pureness
of
heart,
for
the
grace
of
his
lips
the
king
shall
be
his
friend.
022:012
The
eyes
of
the
LORD
preserve
knowledge,
and
he
overthroweth
the
words
of
the
transgressor.
022:013
The
slothful
man
saith,
There
is
a
lion
without,
I
shall
be
slain
in
the
streets.
022:014
The
mouth
of
strange
women
is
a
deep
pit:
he
that
is
abhorred
of
the
LORD
shall
fall
therein.
022:015
Foolishness
is
bound
in
the
heart
of
a
child;
but
the
rod
of
correction
shall
drive
it
far
from
him.
022:016
He
that
oppresseth
the
poor
to
increase
his
riches,
and
he
that
giveth
to
the
rich,
shall
surely
come
to
want.
022:017
Bow
down
thine
ear,
and
hear
the
words
of
the
wise,
and
apply
thine
heart
unto
my
knowledge.
022:018
For
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
if
thou
keep
them
within
thee;
they
shall
withal
be
fitted
in
thy
lips.
022:019
That
thy
trust
may
be
in
the
LORD,
I
have
made
known
to
thee
this
day,
even
to
thee.
022:020
Have
not
I
written
to
thee
excellent
things
in
counsels
and
knowledge,
022:021
That
I
might
make
thee
know
the
certainty
of
the
words
of
truth;
that
thou
mightest
answer
the
words
of
truth
to
them
that
send
unto
thee?
022:022
Rob
not
the
poor,
because
he
is
poor:
neither
oppress
the
afflicted
in
the
gate:
022:023
For
the
LORD
will
plead
their
cause,
and
spoil
the
soul
of
those
that
spoiled
them.
022:024
Make
no
friendship
with
an
angry
man;
and
with
a
furious
man
thou
shalt
not
go:
022:025
Lest
thou
learn
his
ways,
and
get
a
snare
to
thy
soul.
022:026
Be
not
thou
one
of
them
that
strike
hands,
or
of
them
that
are
sureties
for
debts.
022:027
If
thou
hast
nothing
to
pay,
why
should
he
take
away
thy
bed
from
under
thee?
022:028
Remove
not
the
ancient
landmark,
which
thy
fathers
have
set.
022:029
Seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
business?
he
shall
stand
before
kings;
he
shall
not
stand
before
mean
men.
023:001
When
thou
sittest
to
eat
with
a
ruler,
consider
diligently
what
is
before
thee:
023:002
And
put
a
knife
to
thy
throat,
if
thou
be
a
man
given
to
appetite.
023:003
Be
not
desirous
of
his
dainties:
for
they
are
deceitful
meat.
023:004
Labour
not
to
be
rich:
cease
from
thine
own
wisdom.
023:005
Wilt
thou
set
thine
eyes
upon
that
which
is
not?
for
riches
certainly
make
themselves
wings;
they
fly
away
as
an
eagle
toward
heaven.
023:006
Eat
thou
not
the
bread
of
him
that
hath
an
evil
eye,
neither
desire
thou
his
dainty
meats:
023:007
For
as
he
thinketh
in
his
heart,
so
is
he:
Eat
and
drink,
saith
he
to
thee;
but
his
heart
is
not
with
thee.
023:008
The
morsel
which
thou
hast
eaten
shalt
thou
vomit
up,
and
lose
thy
sweet
words.
023:009
Speak
not
in
the
ears
of
a
fool:
for
he
will
despise
the
wisdom
of
thy
words.
023:010
Remove
not
the
old
landmark;
and
enter
not
into
the
fields
of
the
fatherless:
023:011
For
their
redeemer
is
mighty;
he
shall
plead
their
cause
with
thee.
023:012
Apply
thine
heart
unto
instruction,
and
thine
ears
to
the
words
of
knowledge.
023:013
Withhold
not
correction
from
the
child:
for
if
thou
beatest
him
with
the
rod,
he
shall
not
die.
023:014
Thou
shalt
beat
him
with
the
rod,
and
shalt
deliver
his
soul
from
hell.
023:015
My
son,
if
thine
heart
be
wise,
my
heart
shall
rejoice,
even
mine.
023:016
Yea,
my
reins
shall
rejoice,
when
thy
lips
speak
right
things.
023:017
Let
not
thine
heart
envy
sinners:
but
be
thou
in
the
fear
of
the
LORD
all
the
day
long.
023:018
For
surely
there
is
an
end;
and
thine
expectation
shall
not
be
cut
off.
023:019
Hear
thou,
my
son,
and
be
wise,
and
guide
thine
heart
in
the
way.
023:020
Be
not
among
winebibbers;
among
riotous
eaters
of
flesh:
023:021
For
the
drunkard
and
the
glutton
shall
come
to
poverty:
and
drowsiness
shall
clothe
a
man
with
rags.
023:022
Hearken
unto
thy
father
that
begat
thee,
and
despise
not
thy
mother
when
she
is
old.
023:023
Buy
the
truth,
and
sell
it
not;
also
wisdom,
and
instruction,
and
understanding.
023:024
The
father
of
the
righteous
shall
greatly
rejoice:
and
he
that
begetteth
a
wise
child
shall
have
joy
of
him.
023:025
Thy
father
and
thy
mother
shall
be
glad,
and
she
that
bare
thee
shall
rejoice.
023:026
My
son,
give
me
thine
heart,
and
let
thine
eyes
observe
my
ways.
023:027
For
a
whore
is
a
deep
ditch;
and
a
strange
woman
is
a
narrow
pit.
023:028
She
also
lieth
in
wait
as
for
a
prey,
and
increaseth
the
transgressors
among
men.
023:029
Who
hath
woe?
who
hath
sorrow?
who
hath
contentions?
who
hath
babbling?
who
hath
wounds
without
cause?
who
hath
redness
of
eyes?
023:030
They
that
tarry
long
at
the
wine;
they
that
go
to
seek
mixed
wine.
023:031
Look
not
thou
upon
the
wine
when
it
is
red,
when
it
giveth
his
colour
in
the
cup,
when
it
moveth
itself
aright.
023:032
At
the
last
it
biteth
like
a
serpent,
and
stingeth
like
an
adder.
023:033
Thine
eyes
shall
behold
strange
women,
and
thine
heart
shall
utter
perverse
things.
023:034
Yea,
thou
shalt
be
as
he
that
lieth
down
in
the
midst
of
the
sea,
or
as
he
that
lieth
upon
the
top
of
a
mast.
023:035
They
have
stricken
me,
shalt
thou
say,
and
I
was
not
sick;
they
have
beaten
me,
and
I
felt
it
not:
when
shall
I
awake?
I
will
seek
it
yet
again.
024:001
Be
not
thou
envious
against
evil
men,
neither
desire
to
be
with
them.
024:002
For
their
heart
studieth
destruction,
and
their
lips
talk
of
mischief.
024:003
Through
wisdom
is
an
house
builded;
and
by
understanding
it
is
established:
024:004
And
by
knowledge
shall
the
chambers
be
filled
with
all
precious
and
pleasant
riches.
024:005
A
wise
man
is
strong;
yea,
a
man
of
knowledge
increaseth
strength.
024:006
For
by
wise
counsel
thou
shalt
make
thy
war:
and
in
multitude
of
counsellors
there
is
safety.
024:007
Wisdom
is
too
high
for
a
fool:
he
openeth
not
his
mouth
in
the
gate.
024:008
He
that
deviseth
to
do
evil
shall
be
called
a
mischievous
person.
024:009
The
thought
of
foolishness
is
sin:
and
the
scorner
is
an
abomination
to
men.
024:010
If
thou
faint
in
the
day
of
adversity,
thy
strength
is
small.
024:011
If
thou
forbear
to
deliver
them
that
are
drawn
unto
death,
and
those
that
are
ready
to
be
slain;
024:012
If
thou
sayest,
Behold,
we
knew
it
not;
doth
not
he
that
pondereth
the
heart
consider
it?
and
he
that
keepeth
thy
soul,
doth
not
he
know
it?
and
shall
not
he
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
works?
024:013
My
son,
eat
thou
honey,
because
it
is
good;
and
the
honeycomb,
which
is
sweet
to
thy
taste:
024:014
So
shall
the
knowledge
of
wisdom
be
unto
thy
soul:
when
thou
hast
found
it,
then
there
shall
be
a
reward,
and
thy
expectation
shall
not
be
cut
off.
024:015
Lay
not
wait,
O
wicked
man,
against
the
dwelling
of
the
righteous;
spoil
not
his
resting
place:
024:016
For
a
just
man
falleth
seven
times,
and
riseth
up
again:
but
the
wicked
shall
fall
into
mischief.
024:017
Rejoice
not
when
thine
enemy
falleth,
and
let
not
thine
heart
be
glad
when
he
stumbleth:
024:018
Lest
the
LORD
see
it,
and
it
displease
him,
and
he
turn
away
his
wrath
from
him.
024:019
Fret
not
thyself
because
of
evil
men,
neither
be
thou
envious
at
the
wicked:
024:020
For
there
shall
be
no
reward
to
the
evil
man;
the
candle
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out.
024:021
My
son,
fear
thou
the
LORD
and
the
king:
and
meddle
not
with
them
that
are
given
to
change:
024:022
For
their
calamity
shall
rise
suddenly;
and
who
knoweth
the
ruin
of
them
both?
024:023
These
things
also
belong
to
the
wise.
It
is
not
good
to
have
respect
of
persons
in
judgment.
024:024
He
that
saith
unto
the
wicked,
Thou
are
righteous;
him
shall
the
people
curse,
nations
shall
abhor
him:
024:025
But
to
them
that
rebuke
him
shall
be
delight,
and
a
good
blessing
shall
come
upon
them.
024:026
Every
man
shall
kiss
his
lips
that
giveth
a
right
answer.
024:027
Prepare
thy
work
without,
and
make
it
fit
for
thyself
in
the
field;
and
afterwards
build
thine
house.
024:028
Be
not
a
witness
against
thy
neighbour
without
cause;
and
deceive
not
with
thy
lips.
024:029
Say
not,
I
will
do
so
to
him
as
he
hath
done
to
me:
I
will
render
to
the
man
according
to
his
work.
024:030
I
went
by
the
field
of
the
slothful,
and
by
the
vineyard
of
the
man
void
of
understanding;
024:031
And,
lo,
it
was
all
grown
over
with
thorns,
and
nettles
had
covered
the
face
thereof,
and
the
stone
wall
thereof
was
broken
down.
024:032
Then
I
saw,
and
considered
it
well:
I
looked
upon
it,
and
received
instruction.
024:033
Yet
a
little
sleep,
a
little
slumber,
a
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
sleep:
024:034
So
shall
thy
poverty
come
as
one
that
travelleth;
and
thy
want
as
an
armed
man.
025:001
These
are
also
proverbs
of
Solomon,
which
the
men
of
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah
copied
out.
025:002
It
is
the
glory
of
God
to
conceal
a
thing:
but
the
honour
of
kings
is
to
search
out
a
matter.
025:003
The
heaven
for
height,
and
the
earth
for
depth,
and
the
heart
of
kings
is
unsearchable.
025:004
Take
away
the
dross
from
the
silver,
and
there
shall
come
forth
a
vessel
for
the
finer.
025:005
Take
away
the
wicked
from
before
the
king,
and
his
throne
shall
be
established
in
righteousness.
025:006
