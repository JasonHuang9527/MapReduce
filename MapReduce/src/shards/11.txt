all
thy
borders
with
frogs:
008:003
And
the
river
shall
bring
forth
frogs
abundantly,
which
shall
go
up
and
come
into
thine
house,
and
into
thy
bedchamber,
and
upon
thy
bed,
and
into
the
house
of
thy
servants,
and
upon
thy
people,
and
into
thine
ovens,
and
into
thy
kneadingtroughs:
008:004
And
the
frogs
shall
come
up
both
on
thee,
and
upon
thy
people,
and
upon
all
thy
servants.
008:005
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
Say
unto
Aaron,
Stretch
forth
thine
hand
with
thy
rod
over
the
streams,
over
the
rivers,
and
over
the
ponds,
and
cause
frogs
to
come
up
upon
the
land
of
Egypt.
008:006
And
Aaron
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
waters
of
Egypt;
and
the
frogs
came
up,
and
covered
the
land
of
Egypt.
008:007
And
the
magicians
did
so
with
their
enchantments,
and
brought
up
frogs
upon
the
land
of
Egypt.
008:008
Then
Pharaoh
called
for
Moses
and
Aaron,
and
said,
Intreat
the
LORD,
that
he
may
take
away
the
frogs
from
me,
and
from
my
people;
and
I
will
let
the
people
go,
that
they
may
do
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD.
008:009
And
Moses
said
unto
Pharaoh,
Glory
over
me:
when
shall
I
intreat
for
thee,
and
for
thy
servants,
and
for
thy
people,
to
destroy
the
frogs
from
thee
and
thy
houses,
that
they
may
remain
in
the
river
only?
008:010
And
he
said,
To
morrow.
And
he
said,
Be
it
according
to
thy
word:
that
thou
mayest
know
that
there
is
none
like
unto
the
LORD
our
God.
008:011
And
the
frogs
shall
depart
from
thee,
and
from
thy
houses,
and
from
thy
servants,
and
from
thy
people;
they
shall
remain
in
the
river
only.
008:012
And
Moses
and
Aaron
went
out
from
Pharaoh:
and
Moses
cried
unto
the
LORD
because
of
the
frogs
which
he
had
brought
against
Pharaoh.
008:013
And
the
LORD
did
according
to
the
word
of
Moses;
and
the
frogs
died
out
of
the
houses,
out
of
the
villages,
and
out
of
the
fields.
008:014
And
they
gathered
them
together
upon
heaps:
and
the
land
stank.
008:015
But
when
Pharaoh
saw
that
there
was
respite,
he
hardened
his
heart,
and
hearkened
not
unto
them;
as
the
LORD
had
said.
008:016
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Say
unto
Aaron,
Stretch
out
thy
rod,
and
smite
the
dust
of
the
land,
that
it
may
become
lice
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
008:017
And
they
did
so;
for
Aaron
stretched
out
his
hand
with
his
rod,
and
smote
the
dust
of
the
earth,
and
it
became
lice
in
man,
and
in
beast;
all
the
dust
of
the
land
became
lice
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
008:018
And
the
magicians
did
so
with
their
enchantments
to
bring
forth
lice,
but
they
could
not:
so
there
were
lice
upon
man,
and
upon
beast.
008:019
Then
the
magicians
said
unto
Pharaoh,
This
is
the
finger
of
God:
and
Pharaoh's
heart
was
hardened,
and
he
hearkened
not
unto
them;
as
the
LORD
had
said.
008:020
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Rise
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
stand
before
Pharaoh;
lo,
he
cometh
forth
to
the
water;
and
say
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Let
my
people
go,
that
they
may
serve
me.
008:021
Else,
if
thou
wilt
not
let
my
people
go,
behold,
I
will
send
swarms
of
flies
upon
thee,
and
upon
thy
servants,
and
upon
thy
people,
and
into
thy
houses:
and
the
houses
of
the
Egyptians
shall
be
full
of
swarms
of
flies,
and
also
the
ground
whereon
they
are.
008:022
And
I
will
sever
in
that
day
the
land
of
Goshen,
in
which
my
people
dwell,
that
no
swarms
of
flies
shall
be
there;
to
the
end
thou
mayest
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
in
the
midst
of
the
earth.
008:023
And
I
will
put
a
division
between
my
people
and
thy
people:
to
morrow
shall
this
sign
be.
008:024
And
the
LORD
did
so;
and
there
came
a
grievous
swarm
of
flies
into
the
house
of
Pharaoh,
and
into
his
servants'
houses,
and
into
all
the
land
of
Egypt:
the
land
was
corrupted
by
reason
of
the
swarm
of
flies.
008:025
And
Pharaoh
called
for
Moses
and
for
Aaron,
and
said,
Go
ye,
sacrifice
to
your
God
in
the
land.
008:026
And
Moses
said,
It
is
not
meet
so
to
do;
for
we
shall
sacrifice
the
abomination
of
the
Egyptians
to
the
LORD
our
God:
lo,
shall
we
sacrifice
the
abomination
of
the
Egyptians
before
their
eyes,
and
will
they
not
stone
us?
008:027
We
will
go
three
days'
journey
into
the
wilderness,
and
sacrifice
to
the
LORD
our
God,
as
he
shall
command
us.
008:028
And
Pharaoh
said,
I
will
let
you
go,
that
ye
may
sacrifice
to
the
LORD
your
God
in
the
wilderness;
only
ye
shall
not
go
very
far
away:
intreat
for
me.
008:029
And
Moses
said,
Behold,
I
go
out
from
thee,
and
I
will
intreat
the
LORD
that
the
swarms
of
flies
may
depart
from
Pharaoh,
from
his
servants,
and
from
his
people,
to
morrow:
but
let
not
Pharaoh
deal
deceitfully
any
more
in
not
letting
the
people
go
to
sacrifice
to
the
LORD.
008:030
And
Moses
went
out
from
Pharaoh,
and
intreated
the
LORD.
008:031
And
the
LORD
did
according
to
the
word
of
Moses;
and
he
removed
the
swarms
of
flies
from
Pharaoh,
from
his
servants,
and
from
his
people;
there
remained
not
one.
008:032
And
Pharaoh
hardened
his
heart
at
this
time
also,
neither
would
he
let
the
people
go.
009:001
Then
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Go
in
unto
Pharaoh,
and
tell
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
the
Hebrews,
Let
my
people
go,
that
they
may
serve
me.
009:002
For
if
thou
refuse
to
let
them
go,
and
wilt
hold
them
still,
009:003
Behold,
the
hand
of
the
LORD
is
upon
thy
cattle
which
is
in
the
field,
upon
the
horses,
upon
the
asses,
upon
the
camels,
upon
the
oxen,
and
upon
the
sheep:
there
shall
be
a
very
grievous
murrain.
009:004
And
the
LORD
shall
sever
between
the
cattle
of
Israel
and
the
cattle
of
Egypt:
and
there
shall
nothing
die
of
all
that
is
the
children's
of
Israel.
009:005
And
the
LORD
appointed
a
set
time,
saying,
To
morrow
the
LORD
shall
do
this
thing
in
the
land.
009:006
And
the
LORD
did
that
thing
on
the
morrow,
and
all
the
cattle
of
Egypt
died:
but
of
the
cattle
of
the
children
of
Israel
died
not
one.
009:007
And
Pharaoh
sent,
and,
behold,
there
was
not
one
of
the
cattle
of
the
Israelites
dead.
And
the
heart
of
Pharaoh
was
hardened,
and
he
did
not
let
the
people
go.
009:008
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron,
Take
to
you
handfuls
of
ashes
of
the
furnace,
and
let
Moses
sprinkle
it
toward
the
heaven
in
the
sight
of
Pharaoh.
009:009
And
it
shall
become
small
dust
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
shall
be
a
boil
breaking
forth
with
blains
upon
man,
and
upon
beast,
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
009:010
And
they
took
ashes
of
the
furnace,
and
stood
before
Pharaoh;
and
Moses
sprinkled
it
up
toward
heaven;
and
it
became
a
boil
breaking
forth
with
blains
upon
man,
and
upon
beast.
009:011
And
the
magicians
could
not
stand
before
Moses
because
of
the
boils;
for
the
boil
was
upon
the
magicians,
and
upon
all
the
Egyptians.
009:012
And
the
LORD
hardened
the
heart
of
Pharaoh,
and
he
hearkened
not
unto
them;
as
the
LORD
had
spoken
unto
Moses.
009:013
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Rise
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
stand
before
Pharaoh,
and
say
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
the
Hebrews,
Let
my
people
go,
that
they
may
serve
me.
009:014
For
I
will
at
this
time
send
all
my
plagues
upon
thine
heart,
and
upon
thy
servants,
and
upon
thy
people;
that
thou
mayest
know
that
there
is
none
like
me
in
all
the
earth.
009:015
For
now
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand,
that
I
may
smite
thee
and
thy
people
with
pestilence;
and
thou
shalt
be
cut
off
from
the
earth.
009:016
And
in
very
deed
for
this
cause
have
I
raised
thee
up,
for
to
shew
in
thee
my
power;
and
that
my
name
may
be
declared
throughout
all
the
earth.
009:017
As
yet
exaltest
thou
thyself
against
my
people,
that
thou
wilt
not
let
them
go?
009:018
Behold,
to
morrow
about
this
time
I
will
cause
it
to
rain
a
very
grievous
hail,
such
as
hath
not
been
in
Egypt
since
the
foundation
thereof
even
until
now.
009:019
Send
therefore
now,
and
gather
thy
cattle,
and
all
that
thou
hast
in
the
field;
for
upon
every
man
and
beast
which
shall
be
found
in
the
field,
and
shall
not
be
brought
home,
the
hail
shall
come
down
upon
them,
and
they
shall
die.
009:020
He
that
feared
the
word
of
the
LORD
among
the
servants
of
Pharaoh
made
his
servants
and
his
cattle
flee
into
the
houses:
009:021
And
he
that
regarded
not
the
word
of
the
LORD
left
his
servants
and
his
cattle
in
the
field.
009:022
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Stretch
forth
thine
hand
toward
heaven,
that
there
may
be
hail
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt,
upon
man,
and
upon
beast,
and
upon
every
herb
of
the
field,
throughout
the
land
of
Egypt.
009:023
And
Moses
stretched
forth
his
rod
toward
heaven:
and
the
LORD
sent
thunder
and
hail,
and
the
fire
ran
along
upon
the
ground;
and
the
LORD
rained
hail
upon
the
land
of
Egypt.
009:024
So
there
was
hail,
and
fire
mingled
with
the
hail,
very
grievous,
such
as
there
was
none
like
it
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
since
it
became
a
nation.
009:025
And
the
hail
smote
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt
all
that
was
in
the
field,
both
man
and
beast;
and
the
hail
smote
every
herb
of
the
field,
and
brake
every
tree
of
the
field.
009:026
Only
in
the
land
of
Goshen,
where
the
children
of
Israel
were,
was
there
no
hail.
009:027
And
Pharaoh
sent,
and
called
for
Moses
and
Aaron,
and
said
unto
them,
I
have
sinned
this
time:
the
LORD
is
righteous,
and
I
and
my
people
are
wicked.
009:028
Intreat
the
LORD
(for
it
is
enough)
that
there
be
no
more
mighty
thunderings
and
hail;
and
I
will
let
you
go,
and
ye
shall
stay
no
longer.
009:029
And
Moses
said
unto
him,
As
soon
as
I
am
gone
out
of
the
city,
I
will
spread
abroad
my
hands
unto
the
LORD;
and
the
thunder
shall
cease,
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
hail;
that
thou
mayest
know
how
that
the
earth
is
the
LORD's.
009:030
But
as
for
thee
and
thy
servants,
I
know
that
ye
will
not
yet
fear
the
LORD
God.
009:031
And
the
flax
and
the
barley
was
smitten:
for
the
barley
was
in
the
ear,
and
the
flax
was
bolled.
009:032
But
the
wheat
and
the
rie
were
not
smitten:
for
they
were
not
grown
up.
009:033
And
Moses
went
out
of
the
city
from
Pharaoh,
and
spread
abroad
his
hands
unto
the
LORD:
and
the
thunders
and
hail
ceased,
and
the
rain
was
not
poured
upon
the
earth.
009:034
And
when
Pharaoh
saw
that
the
rain
and
the
hail
and
the
thunders
were
ceased,
he
sinned
yet
more,
and
hardened
his
heart,
he
and
his
servants.
009:035
And
the
heart
of
Pharaoh
was
hardened,
neither
would
he
let
the
children
of
Israel
go;
as
the
LORD
had
spoken
by
Moses.
010:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Go
in
unto
Pharaoh:
for
I
have
hardened
his
heart,
and
the
heart
of
his
servants,
that
I
might
shew
these
my
signs
before
him:
010:002
And
that
thou
mayest
tell
in
the
ears
of
thy
son,
and
of
thy
son's
son,
what
things
I
have
wrought
in
Egypt,
and
my
signs
which
I
have
done
among
them;
that
ye
may
know
how
that
I
am
the
LORD.
010:003
And
Moses
and
Aaron
came
in
unto
Pharaoh,
and
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
the
Hebrews,
How
long
wilt
thou
refuse
to
humble
thyself
before
me?
let
my
people
go,
that
they
may
serve
me.
010:004
Else,
if
thou
refuse
to
let
my
people
go,
behold,
to
morrow
will
I
bring
the
locusts
into
thy
coast:
010:005
And
they
shall
cover
the
face
of
the
earth,
that
one
cannot
be
able
to
see
the
earth:
and
they
shall
eat
the
residue
of
that
which
is
escaped,
which
remaineth
unto
you
from
the
hail,
and
shall
eat
every
tree
which
groweth
for
you
out
of
the
field:
010:006
And
they
shall
fill
thy
houses,
and
the
houses
of
all
thy
servants,
and
the
houses
of
all
the
Egyptians;
which
neither
thy
fathers,
nor
thy
fathers'
fathers
have
seen,
since
the
day
that
they
were
upon
the
earth
unto
this
day.
And
he
turned
himself,
and
went
out
from
Pharaoh.
010:007
And
Pharaoh's
servants
said
unto
him,
How
long
shall
this
man
be
a
snare
unto
us?
let
the
men
go,
that
they
may
serve
the
LORD
their
God:
knowest
thou
not
yet
that
Egypt
is
destroyed?
010:008
And
Moses
and
Aaron
were
brought
again
unto
Pharaoh:
and
he
said
unto
them,
Go,
serve
the
LORD
your
God:
but
who
are
they
that
shall
go?
010:009
And
Moses
said,
We
will
go
with
our
young
and
with
our
old,
with
our
sons
and
with
our
daughters,
with
our
flocks
and
with
our
herds
will
we
go;
for
we
must
hold
a
feast
unto
the
LORD.
010:010
And
he
said
unto
them,
Let
the
LORD
be
so
with
you,
as
I
will
let
you
go,
and
your
little
ones:
look
to
it;
for
evil
is
before
you.
010:011
Not
so:
go
now
ye
that
are
men,
and
serve
the
LORD;
for
that
ye
did
desire.
And
they
were
driven
out
from
Pharaoh's
presence.
010:012
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Stretch
out
thine
hand
over
the
land
of
Egypt
for
the
locusts,
that
they
may
come
up
upon
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
eat
every
herb
of
the
land,
even
all
that
the
hail
hath
left.
010:013
And
Moses
stretched
forth
his
rod
over
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
the
LORD
brought
an
east
wind
upon
the
land
all
that
day,
and
all
that
night;
and
when
it
was
morning,
the
east
wind
brought
the
locusts.
010:014
And
the
locust
went
up
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
rested
in
all
the
coasts
of
Egypt:
very
grievous
were
they;
before
them
there
were
no
such
locusts
as
they,
neither
after
them
shall
be
such.
010:015
For
they
covered
the
face
of
the
whole
earth,
so
that
the
land
was
darkened;
and
they
did
eat
every
herb
of
the
land,
and
all
the
fruit
of
the
trees
which
the
hail
had
left:
and
there
remained
not
any
green
thing
in
the
trees,
or
in
the
herbs
of
the
field,
through
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
010:016
Then
Pharaoh
called
for
Moses
and
Aaron
in
haste;
and
he
said,
I
have
sinned
against
the
LORD
your
God,
and
against
you.
010:017
Now
therefore
forgive,
I
pray
thee,
my
sin
only
this
once,
and
intreat
the
LORD
your
God,
that
he
may
take
away
from
me
this
death
only.
010:018
And
he
went
out
from
Pharaoh,
and
intreated
the
LORD.
010:019
And
the
LORD
turned
a
mighty
strong
west
wind,
which
took
away
the
locusts,
and
cast
them
into
the
Red
sea;
there
remained
not
one
locust
in
all
the
coasts
of
Egypt.
010:020
But
the
LORD
hardened
Pharaoh's
heart,
so
that
he
would
not
let
the
children
of
Israel
go.
010:021
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Stretch
out
thine
hand
toward
heaven,
that
there
may
be
darkness
over
the
land
of
Egypt,
even
darkness
which
may
be
felt.
010:022
And
Moses
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
heaven;
and
there
was
a
thick
darkness
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
three
days:
010:023
They
saw
not
one
another,
neither
rose
any
from
his
place
for
three
days:
but
all
the
children
of
Israel
had
light
in
their
dwellings.
010:024
And
Pharaoh
called
unto
Moses,
and
said,
Go
ye,
serve
the
LORD;
only
let
your
flocks
and
your
herds
be
stayed:
let
your
little
ones
also
go
with
you.
010:025
And
Moses
said,
Thou
must
give
us
also
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings,
that
we
may
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
our
God.
010:026
Our
cattle
also
shall
go
with
us;
there
shall
not
an
hoof
be
left
behind;
for
thereof
must
we
take
to
serve
the
LORD
our
God;
and
we
know
not
with
what
we
must
serve
the
LORD,
until
we
come
thither.
010:027
But
the
LORD
hardened
Pharaoh's
heart,
and
he
would
not
let
them
go.
010:028
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
him,
Get
thee
from
me,
take
heed
to
thyself,
see
my
face
no
more;
for
in
that
day
thou
seest
my
face
thou
shalt
die.
010:029
And
Moses
said,
Thou
hast
spoken
well,
I
will
see
thy
face
again
no
more.
011:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Yet
will
I
bring
one
plague
more
upon
Pharaoh,
and
upon
Egypt;
afterwards
he
will
let
you
go
hence:
when
he
shall
let
you
go,
he
shall
surely
thrust
you
out
hence
altogether.
011:002
Speak
now
in
the
ears
of
the
people,
and
let
every
man
borrow
of
his
neighbour,
and
every
woman
of
her
neighbour,
jewels
of
silver
and
jewels
of
gold.
011:003
And
the
LORD
gave
the
people
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
Egyptians.
Moreover
the
man
Moses
was
very
great
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
in
the
sight
of
Pharaoh's
servants,
and
in
the
sight
of
the
people.
011:004
And
Moses
said,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
About
midnight
will
I
go
out
into
the
midst
of
Egypt:
011:005
And
all
the
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
shall
die,
from
the
first
born
of
Pharaoh
that
sitteth
upon
his
throne,
even
unto
the
firstborn
of
the
maidservant
that
is
behind
the
mill;
and
all
the
firstborn
of
beasts.
011:006
And
there
shall
be
a
great
cry
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt,
such
as
there
was
none
like
it,
nor
shall
be
like
it
any
more.
011:007
But
against
any
of
the
children
of
Israel
shall
not
a
dog
move
his
tongue,
against
man
or
beast:
that
ye
may
know
how
that
the
LORD
doth
put
a
difference
between
the
Egyptians
and
Israel.
011:008
And
all
these
thy
servants
shall
come
down
unto
me,
and
bow
down
themselves
unto
me,
saying,
Get
thee
out,
and
all
the
people
that
follow
thee:
and
after
that
I
will
go
out.
And
he
went
out
from
Pharaoh
in
a
great
anger.
011:009
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Pharaoh
shall
not
hearken
unto
you;
that
my
wonders
may
be
multiplied
in
the
land
of
Egypt.
011:010
And
Moses
and
Aaron
did
all
these
wonders
before
Pharaoh:
and
the
LORD
hardened
Pharaoh's
heart,
so
that
he
would
not
let
the
children
of
Israel
go
out
of
his
land.
012:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
Aaron
in
the
land
of
Egypt
saying,
012:002
This
month
shall
be
unto
you
the
beginning
of
months:
it
shall
be
the
first
month
of
the
year
to
you.
012:003
Speak
ye
unto
all
the
congregation
of
Israel,
saying,
In
the
tenth
day
of
this
month
they
shall
take
to
them
every
man
a
lamb,
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers,
a
lamb
for
an
house:
012:004
And
if
the
household
be
too
little
for
the
lamb,
let
him
and
his
neighbour
next
unto
his
house
take
it
according
to
the
number
of
the
souls;
every
man
according
to
his
eating
shall
make
your
count
for
the
lamb.
012:005
Your
lamb
shall
be
without
blemish,
a
male
of
the
first
year:
ye
shall
take
it
out
from
the
sheep,
or
from
the
goats:
012:006
And
ye
shall
keep
it
up
until
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
same
month:
and
the
whole
assembly
of
the
congregation
of
Israel
shall
kill
it
in
the
evening.
012:007
And
they
shall
take
of
the
blood,
and
strike
it
on
the
two
side
posts
and
on
the
upper
door
post
of
the
houses,
wherein
they
shall
eat
it.
012:008
And
they
shall
eat
the
flesh
in
that
night,
roast
with
fire,
and
unleavened
bread;
and
with
bitter
herbs
they
shall
eat
it.
012:009
Eat
not
of
it
raw,
nor
sodden
at
all
with
water,
but
roast
with
fire;
his
head
with
his
legs,
and
with
the
purtenance
thereof.
012:010
And
ye
shall
let
nothing
of
it
remain
until
the
morning;
and
that
which
remaineth
of
it
until
the
morning
ye
shall
burn
with
fire.
012:011
And
thus
shall
ye
eat
it;
with
your
loins
girded,
your
shoes
on
your
feet,
and
your
staff
in
your
hand;
and
ye
shall
eat
it
in
haste:
it
is
the
LORD's
passover.
012:012
For
I
will
pass
through
the
land
of
Egypt
this
night,
and
will
smite
all
the
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
both
man
and
beast;
and
against
all
the
gods
of
Egypt
I
will
execute
judgment:
I
am
the
LORD.
012:013
And
the
blood
shall
be
to
you
for
a
token
upon
the
houses
where
ye
are:
and
when
I
see
the
blood,
I
will
pass
over
you,
and
the
plague
shall
not
be
upon
you
to
destroy
you,
when
I
smite
the
land
of
Egypt.
012:014
And
this
day
shall
be
unto
you
for
a
memorial;
and
ye
shall
keep
it
a
feast
to
the
LORD
throughout
your
generations;
ye
shall
keep
it
a
feast
by
an
ordinance
for
ever.
012:015
Seven
days
shall
ye
eat
unleavened
bread;
even
the
first
day
ye
shall
put
away
leaven
out
of
your
houses:
for
whosoever
eateth
leavened
bread
from
the
first
day
until
the
seventh
day,
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
Israel.
012:016
And
in
the
first
day
there
shall
be
an
holy
convocation,
and
in
the
seventh
day
there
shall
be
an
holy
convocation
to
you;
no
manner
of
work
shall
be
done
in
them,
save
that
which
every
man
must
eat,
that
only
may
be
done
of
you.
012:017
And
ye
shall
observe
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread;
for
in
this
selfsame
day
have
I
brought
your
armies
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt:
therefore
shall
ye
observe
this
day
in
your
generations
by
an
ordinance
for
ever.
012:018
In
the
first
month,
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
at
even,
ye
shall
eat
unleavened
bread,
until
the
one
and
twentieth
day
of
the
month
at
even.
012:019
Seven
days
shall
there
be
no
leaven
found
in
your
houses:
for
whosoever
eateth
that
which
is
leavened,
even
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
congregation
of
Israel,
whether
he
be
a
stranger,
or
born
in
the
land.
012:020
Ye
shall
eat
nothing
leavened;
in
all
your
habitations
shall
ye
eat
unleavened
bread.
012:021
Then
Moses
called
for
all
the
elders
of
Israel,
and
said
unto
them,
Draw
out
and
take
you
a
lamb
according
to
your
families,
and
kill
the
passover.
012:022
And
ye
shall
take
a
bunch
of
hyssop,
and
dip
it
in
the
blood
that
is
in
the
bason,
and
strike
the
lintel
and
the
two
side
posts
with
the
blood
that
is
in
the
bason;
and
none
of
you
shall
go
out
at
the
door
of
his
house
until
the
morning.
012:023
For
the
LORD
will
pass
through
to
smite
the
Egyptians;
and
when
he
seeth
the
blood
upon
the
lintel,
and
on
the
two
side
posts,
the
LORD
will
pass
over
the
door,
and
will
not
suffer
the
destroyer
to
come
in
unto
your
houses
to
smite
you.
012:024
And
ye
shall
observe
this
thing
for
an
ordinance
to
thee
and
to
thy
sons
for
ever.
012:025
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
ye
be
come
to
the
land
which
the
LORD
will
give
you,
according
as
he
hath
promised,
that
ye
shall
keep
this
service.
012:026
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
your
children
shall
say
unto
you,
What
mean
ye
by
this
service?
012:027
That
ye
shall
say,
It
is
the
sacrifice
of
the
LORD's
passover,
who
passed
over
the
houses
of
the
children
of
Israel
in
Egypt,
when
he
smote
the
Egyptians,
and
delivered
our
houses.
And
the
people
bowed
