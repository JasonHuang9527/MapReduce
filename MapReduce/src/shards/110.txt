Put
not
forth
thyself
in
the
presence
of
the
king,
and
stand
not
in
the
place
of
great
men:
025:007
For
better
it
is
that
it
be
said
unto
thee,
Come
up
hither;
than
that
thou
shouldest
be
put
lower
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
whom
thine
eyes
have
seen.
025:008
Go
not
forth
hastily
to
strive,
lest
thou
know
not
what
to
do
in
the
end
thereof,
when
thy
neighbour
hath
put
thee
to
shame.
025:009
Debate
thy
cause
with
thy
neighbour
himself;
and
discover
not
a
secret
to
another:
025:010
Lest
he
that
heareth
it
put
thee
to
shame,
and
thine
infamy
turn
not
away.
025:011
A
word
fitly
spoken
is
like
apples
of
gold
in
pictures
of
silver.
025:012
As
an
earring
of
gold,
and
an
ornament
of
fine
gold,
so
is
a
wise
reprover
upon
an
obedient
ear.
025:013
As
the
cold
of
snow
in
the
time
of
harvest,
so
is
a
faithful
messenger
to
them
that
send
him:
for
he
refresheth
the
soul
of
his
masters.
025:014
Whoso
boasteth
himself
of
a
false
gift
is
like
clouds
and
wind
without
rain.
025:015
By
long
forbearing
is
a
prince
persuaded,
and
a
soft
tongue
breaketh
the
bone.
025:016
Hast
thou
found
honey?
eat
so
much
as
is
sufficient
for
thee,
lest
thou
be
filled
therewith,
and
vomit
it.
025:017
Withdraw
thy
foot
from
thy
neighbour's
house;
lest
he
be
weary
of
thee,
and
so
hate
thee.
025:018
A
man
that
beareth
false
witness
against
his
neighbour
is
a
maul,
and
a
sword,
and
a
sharp
arrow.
025:019
Confidence
in
an
unfaithful
man
in
time
of
trouble
is
like
a
broken
tooth,
and
a
foot
out
of
joint.
025:020
As
he
that
taketh
away
a
garment
in
cold
weather,
and
as
vinegar
upon
nitre,
so
is
he
that
singeth
songs
to
an
heavy
heart.
025:021
If
thine
enemy
be
hungry,
give
him
bread
to
eat;
and
if
he
be
thirsty,
give
him
water
to
drink:
025:022
For
thou
shalt
heap
coals
of
fire
upon
his
head,
and
the
LORD
shall
reward
thee.
025:023
The
north
wind
driveth
away
rain:
so
doth
an
angry
countenance
a
backbiting
tongue.
025:024
It
is
better
to
dwell
in
the
corner
of
the
housetop,
than
with
a
brawling
woman
and
in
a
wide
house.
025:025
As
cold
waters
to
a
thirsty
soul,
so
is
good
news
from
a
far
country.
025:026
A
righteous
man
falling
down
before
the
wicked
is
as
a
troubled
fountain,
and
a
corrupt
spring.
025:027
It
is
not
good
to
eat
much
honey:
so
for
men
to
search
their
own
glory
is
not
glory.
025:028
He
that
hath
no
rule
over
his
own
spirit
is
like
a
city
that
is
broken
down,
and
without
walls.
026:001
As
snow
in
summer,
and
as
rain
in
harvest,
so
honour
is
not
seemly
for
a
fool.
026:002
As
the
bird
by
wandering,
as
the
swallow
by
flying,
so
the
curse
causeless
shall
not
come.
026:003
A
whip
for
the
horse,
a
bridle
for
the
ass,
and
a
rod
for
the
fool's
back.
026:004
Answer
not
a
fool
according
to
his
folly,
lest
thou
also
be
like
unto
him.
026:005
Answer
a
fool
according
to
his
folly,
lest
he
be
wise
in
his
own
conceit.
026:006
He
that
sendeth
a
message
by
the
hand
of
a
fool
cutteth
off
the
feet,
and
drinketh
damage.
026:007
The
legs
of
the
lame
are
not
equal:
so
is
a
parable
in
the
mouth
of
fools.
026:008
As
he
that
bindeth
a
stone
in
a
sling,
so
is
he
that
giveth
honour
to
a
fool.
026:009
As
a
thorn
goeth
up
into
the
hand
of
a
drunkard,
so
is
a
parable
in
the
mouths
of
fools.
026:010
The
great
God
that
formed
all
things
both
rewardeth
the
fool,
and
rewardeth
transgressors.
026:011
As
a
dog
returneth
to
his
vomit,
so
a
fool
returneth
to
his
folly.
026:012
Seest
thou
a
man
wise
in
his
own
conceit?
there
is
more
hope
of
a
fool
than
of
him.
026:013
The
slothful
man
saith,
There
is
a
lion
in
the
way;
a
lion
is
in
the
streets.
026:014
As
the
door
turneth
upon
his
hinges,
so
doth
the
slothful
upon
his
bed.
026:015
The
slothful
hideth
his
hand
in
his
bosom;
it
grieveth
him
to
bring
it
again
to
his
mouth.
026:016
The
sluggard
is
wiser
in
his
own
conceit
than
seven
men
that
can
render
a
reason.
026:017
He
that
passeth
by,
and
meddleth
with
strife
belonging
not
to
him,
is
like
one
that
taketh
a
dog
by
the
ears.
026:018
As
a
mad
man
who
casteth
firebrands,
arrows,
and
death,
026:019
So
is
the
man
that
deceiveth
his
neighbour,
and
saith,
Am
not
I
in
sport?
026:020
Where
no
wood
is,
there
the
fire
goeth
out:
so
where
there
is
no
talebearer,
the
strife
ceaseth.
026:021
As
coals
are
to
burning
coals,
and
wood
to
fire;
so
is
a
contentious
man
to
kindle
strife.
026:022
The
words
of
a
talebearer
are
as
wounds,
and
they
go
down
into
the
innermost
parts
of
the
belly.
026:023
Burning
lips
and
a
wicked
heart
are
like
a
potsherd
covered
with
silver
dross.
026:024
He
that
hateth
dissembleth
with
his
lips,
and
layeth
up
deceit
within
him;
026:025
When
he
speaketh
fair,
believe
him
not:
for
there
are
seven
abominations
in
his
heart.
026:026
Whose
hatred
is
covered
by
deceit,
his
wickedness
shall
be
shewed
before
the
whole
congregation.
026:027
Whoso
diggeth
a
pit
shall
fall
therein:
and
he
that
rolleth
a
stone,
it
will
return
upon
him.
026:028
A
lying
tongue
hateth
those
that
are
afflicted
by
it;
and
a
flattering
mouth
worketh
ruin.
027:001
Boast
not
thyself
of
to
morrow;
for
thou
knowest
not
what
a
day
may
bring
forth.
027:002
Let
another
man
praise
thee,
and
not
thine
own
mouth;
a
stranger,
and
not
thine
own
lips.
027:003
A
stone
is
heavy,
and
the
sand
weighty;
but
a
fool's
wrath
is
heavier
than
them
both.
027:004
Wrath
is
cruel,
and
anger
is
outrageous;
but
who
is
able
to
stand
before
envy?
027:005
Open
rebuke
is
better
than
secret
love.
027:006
Faithful
are
the
wounds
of
a
friend;
but
the
kisses
of
an
enemy
are
deceitful.
027:007
The
full
soul
loatheth
an
honeycomb;
but
to
the
hungry
soul
every
bitter
thing
is
sweet.
027:008
As
a
bird
that
wandereth
from
her
nest,
so
is
a
man
that
wandereth
from
his
place.
027:009
Ointment
and
perfume
rejoice
the
heart:
so
doth
the
sweetness
of
a
man's
friend
by
hearty
counsel.
027:010
Thine
own
friend,
and
thy
father's
friend,
forsake
not;
neither
go
into
thy
brother's
house
in
the
day
of
thy
calamity:
for
better
is
a
neighbour
that
is
near
than
a
brother
far
off.
027:011
My
son,
be
wise,
and
make
my
heart
glad,
that
I
may
answer
him
that
reproacheth
me.
027:012
A
prudent
man
foreseeth
the
evil,
and
hideth
himself;
but
the
simple
pass
on,
and
are
punished.
027:013
Take
his
garment
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger,
and
take
a
pledge
of
him
for
a
strange
woman.
027:014
He
that
blesseth
his
friend
with
a
loud
voice,
rising
early
in
the
morning,
it
shall
be
counted
a
curse
to
him.
027:015
A
continual
dropping
in
a
very
rainy
day
and
a
contentious
woman
are
alike.
027:016
Whosoever
hideth
her
hideth
the
wind,
and
the
ointment
of
his
right
hand,
which
bewrayeth
itself.
027:017
Iron
sharpeneth
iron;
so
a
man
sharpeneth
the
countenance
of
his
friend.
027:018
Whoso
keepeth
the
fig
tree
shall
eat
the
fruit
thereof:
so
he
that
waiteth
on
his
master
shall
be
honoured.
027:019
As
in
water
face
answereth
to
face,
so
the
heart
of
man
to
man.
027:020
Hell
and
destruction
are
never
full;
so
the
eyes
of
man
are
never
satisfied.
027:021
As
the
fining
pot
for
silver,
and
the
furnace
for
gold;
so
is
a
man
to
his
praise.
027:022
Though
thou
shouldest
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
among
wheat
with
a
pestle,
yet
will
not
his
foolishness
depart
from
him.
027:023
Be
thou
diligent
to
know
the
state
of
thy
flocks,
and
look
well
to
thy
herds.
027:024
For
riches
are
not
for
ever:
and
doth
the
crown
endure
to
every
generation?
027:025
The
hay
appeareth,
and
the
tender
grass
sheweth
itself,
and
herbs
of
the
mountains
are
gathered.
027:026
The
lambs
are
for
thy
clothing,
and
the
goats
are
the
price
of
the
field.
027:027
And
thou
shalt
have
goats'
milk
enough
for
thy
food,
for
the
food
of
thy
household,
and
for
the
maintenance
for
thy
maidens.
028:001
The
wicked
flee
when
no
man
pursueth:
but
the
righteous
are
bold
as
a
lion.
028:002
For
the
transgression
of
a
land
many
are
the
princes
thereof:
but
by
a
man
of
understanding
and
knowledge
the
state
thereof
shall
be
prolonged.
028:003
A
poor
man
that
oppresseth
the
poor
is
like
a
sweeping
rain
which
leaveth
no
food.
028:004
They
that
forsake
the
law
praise
the
wicked:
but
such
as
keep
the
law
contend
with
them.
028:005
Evil
men
understand
not
judgment:
but
they
that
seek
the
LORD
understand
all
things.
028:006
Better
is
the
poor
that
walketh
in
his
uprightness,
than
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways,
though
he
be
rich.
028:007
Whoso
keepeth
the
law
is
a
wise
son:
but
he
that
is
a
companion
of
riotous
men
shameth
his
father.
028:008
He
that
by
usury
and
unjust
gain
increaseth
his
substance,
he
shall
gather
it
for
him
that
will
pity
the
poor.
028:009
He
that
turneth
away
his
ear
from
hearing
the
law,
even
his
prayer
shall
be
abomination.
028:010
Whoso
causeth
the
righteous
to
go
astray
in
an
evil
way,
he
shall
fall
himself
into
his
own
pit:
but
the
upright
shall
have
good
things
in
possession.
028:011
The
rich
man
is
wise
in
his
own
conceit;
but
the
poor
that
hath
understanding
searcheth
him
out.
028:012
When
righteous
men
do
rejoice,
there
is
great
glory:
but
when
the
wicked
rise,
a
man
is
hidden.
028:013
He
that
covereth
his
sins
shall
not
prosper:
but
whoso
confesseth
and
forsaketh
them
shall
have
mercy.
028:014
Happy
is
the
man
that
feareth
alway:
but
he
that
hardeneth
his
heart
shall
fall
into
mischief.
028:015
As
a
roaring
lion,
and
a
ranging
bear;
so
is
a
wicked
ruler
over
the
poor
people.
028:016
The
prince
that
wanteth
understanding
is
also
a
great
oppressor:
but
he
that
hateth
covetousness
shall
prolong
his
days.
028:017
A
man
that
doeth
violence
to
the
blood
of
any
person
shall
flee
to
the
pit;
let
no
man
stay
him.
028:018
Whoso
walketh
uprightly
shall
be
saved:
but
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways
shall
fall
at
once.
028:019
He
that
tilleth
his
land
shall
have
plenty
of
bread:
but
he
that
followeth
after
vain
persons
shall
have
poverty
enough.
028:020
A
faithful
man
shall
abound
with
blessings:
but
he
that
maketh
haste
to
be
rich
shall
not
be
innocent.
028:021
To
have
respect
of
persons
is
not
good:
for
for
a
piece
of
bread
that
man
will
transgress.
028:022
He
that
hasteth
to
be
rich
hath
an
evil
eye,
and
considereth
not
that
poverty
shall
come
upon
him.
028:023
He
that
rebuketh
a
man
afterwards
shall
find
more
favour
than
he
that
flattereth
with
the
tongue.
028:024
Whoso
robbeth
his
father
or
his
mother,
and
saith,
It
is
no
transgression;
the
same
is
the
companion
of
a
destroyer.
028:025
He
that
is
of
a
proud
heart
stirreth
up
strife:
but
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
the
LORD
shall
be
made
fat.
028:026
He
that
trusteth
in
his
own
heart
is
a
fool:
but
whoso
walketh
wisely,
he
shall
be
delivered.
028:027
He
that
giveth
unto
the
poor
shall
not
lack:
but
he
that
hideth
his
eyes
shall
have
many
a
curse.
028:028
When
the
wicked
rise,
men
hide
themselves:
but
when
they
perish,
the
righteous
increase.
029:001
He,
that
being
often
reproved
hardeneth
his
neck,
shall
suddenly
be
destroyed,
and
that
without
remedy.
029:002
When
the
righteous
are
in
authority,
the
people
rejoice:
but
when
the
wicked
beareth
rule,
the
people
mourn.
029:003
Whoso
loveth
wisdom
rejoiceth
his
father:
but
he
that
keepeth
company
with
harlots
spendeth
his
substance.
029:004
The
king
by
judgment
establisheth
the
land:
but
he
that
receiveth
gifts
overthroweth
it.
029:005
A
man
that
flattereth
his
neighbour
spreadeth
a
net
for
his
feet.
029:006
In
the
transgression
of
an
evil
man
there
is
a
snare:
but
the
righteous
doth
sing
and
rejoice.
029:007
The
righteous
considereth
the
cause
of
the
poor:
but
the
wicked
regardeth
not
to
know
it.
029:008
Scornful
men
bring
a
city
into
a
snare:
but
wise
men
turn
away
wrath.
029:009
If
a
wise
man
contendeth
with
a
foolish
man,
whether
he
rage
or
laugh,
there
is
no
rest.
029:010
The
bloodthirsty
hate
the
upright:
but
the
just
seek
his
soul.
029:011
A
fool
uttereth
all
his
mind:
but
a
wise
man
keepeth
it
in
till
afterwards.
029:012
If
a
ruler
hearken
to
lies,
all
his
servants
are
wicked.
029:013
The
poor
and
the
deceitful
man
meet
together:
the
LORD
lighteneth
both
their
eyes.
029:014
The
king
that
faithfully
judgeth
the
poor,
his
throne
shall
be
established
for
ever.
029:015
The
rod
and
reproof
give
wisdom:
but
a
child
left
to
himself
bringeth
his
mother
to
shame.
029:016
When
the
wicked
are
multiplied,
transgression
increaseth:
but
the
righteous
shall
see
their
fall.
029:017
Correct
thy
son,
and
he
shall
give
thee
rest;
yea,
he
shall
give
delight
unto
thy
soul.
029:018
Where
there
is
no
vision,
the
people
perish:
but
he
that
keepeth
the
law,
happy
is
he.
029:019
A
servant
will
not
be
corrected
by
words:
for
though
he
understand
he
will
not
answer.
029:020
Seest
thou
a
man
that
is
hasty
in
his
words?
there
is
more
hope
of
a
fool
than
of
him.
029:021
He
that
delicately
bringeth
up
his
servant
from
a
child
shall
have
him
become
his
son
at
the
length.
029:022
An
angry
man
stirreth
up
strife,
and
a
furious
man
aboundeth
in
transgression.
029:023
A
man's
pride
shall
bring
him
low:
but
honour
shall
uphold
the
humble
in
spirit.
029:024
Whoso
is
partner
with
a
thief
hateth
his
own
soul:
he
heareth
cursing,
and
bewrayeth
it
not.
029:025
The
fear
of
man
bringeth
a
snare:
but
whoso
putteth
his
trust
in
the
LORD
shall
be
safe.
029:026
Many
seek
the
ruler's
favour;
but
every
man's
judgment
cometh
from
the
LORD.
029:027
An
unjust
man
is
an
abomination
to
the
just:
and
he
that
is
upright
in
the
way
is
abomination
to
the
wicked.
030:001
The
words
of
Agur
the
son
of
Jakeh,
even
the
prophecy:
the
man
spake
unto
Ithiel,
even
unto
Ithiel
and
Ucal,
030:002
Surely
I
am
more
brutish
than
any
man,
and
have
not
the
understanding
of
a
man.
030:003
I
neither
learned
wisdom,
nor
have
the
knowledge
of
the
holy.
030:004
Who
hath
ascended
up
into
heaven,
or
descended?
who
hath
gathered
the
wind
in
his
fists?
who
hath
bound
the
waters
in
a
garment?
who
hath
established
all
the
ends
of
the
earth?
what
is
his
name,
and
what
is
his
son's
name,
if
thou
canst
tell?
030:005
Every
word
of
God
is
pure:
he
is
a
shield
unto
them
that
put
their
trust
in
him.
030:006
Add
thou
not
unto
his
words,
lest
he
reprove
thee,
and
thou
be
found
a
liar.
030:007
Two
things
have
I
required
of
thee;
deny
me
them
not
before
I
die:
030:008
Remove
far
from
me
vanity
and
lies:
give
me
neither
poverty
nor
riches;
feed
me
with
food
convenient
for
me:
030:009
Lest
I
be
full,
and
deny
thee,
and
say,
Who
is
the
LORD?
or
lest
I
be
poor,
and
steal,
and
take
the
name
of
my
God
in
vain.
030:010
Accuse
not
a
servant
unto
his
master,
lest
he
curse
thee,
and
thou
be
found
guilty.
030:011
There
is
a
generation
that
curseth
their
father,
and
doth
not
bless
their
mother.
030:012
There
is
a
generation
that
are
pure
in
their
own
eyes,
and
yet
is
not
washed
from
their
filthiness.
030:013
There
is
a
generation,
O
how
lofty
are
their
eyes!
and
their
eyelids
are
lifted
up.
030:014
There
is
a
generation,
whose
teeth
are
as
swords,
and
their
jaw
teeth
as
knives,
to
devour
the
poor
from
off
the
earth,
and
the
needy
from
among
men.
030:015
The
horseleach
hath
two
daughters,
crying,
Give,
give.
There
are
three
things
that
are
never
satisfied,
yea,
four
things
say
not,
It
is
enough:
030:016
The
grave;
and
the
barren
womb;
the
earth
that
is
not
filled
with
water;
and
the
fire
that
saith
not,
It
is
enough.
030:017
The
eye
that
mocketh
at
his
father,
and
despiseth
to
obey
his
mother,
the
ravens
of
the
valley
shall
pick
it
out,
and
the
young
eagles
shall
eat
it.
030:018
There
be
three
things
which
are
too
wonderful
for
me,
yea,
four
which
I
know
not:
030:019
The
way
of
an
eagle
in
the
air;
the
way
of
a
serpent
upon
a
rock;
the
way
of
a
ship
in
the
midst
of
the
sea;
and
the
way
of
a
man
with
a
maid.
030:020
Such
is
the
way
of
an
adulterous
woman;
she
eateth,
and
wipeth
her
mouth,
and
saith,
I
have
done
no
wickedness.
030:021
For
three
things
the
earth
is
disquieted,
and
for
four
which
it
cannot
bear:
030:022
For
a
servant
when
he
reigneth;
and
a
fool
when
he
is
filled
with
meat;
030:023
For
an
odious
woman
when
she
is
married;
and
an
handmaid
that
is
heir
to
her
mistress.
030:024
There
be
four
things
which
are
little
upon
the
earth,
but
they
are
exceeding
wise:
030:025
The
ants
are
a
people
not
strong,
yet
they
prepare
their
meat
in
the
summer;
030:026
The
conies
are
but
a
feeble
folk,
yet
make
they
their
houses
in
the
rocks;
030:027
The
locusts
have
no
king,
yet
go
they
forth
all
of
them
by
bands;
030:028
The
spider
taketh
hold
with
her
hands,
and
is
in
kings'
palaces.
030:029
There
be
three
things
which
go
well,
yea,
four
are
comely
in
going:
030:030
A
lion
which
is
strongest
among
beasts,
and
turneth
not
away
for
any;
030:031
A
greyhound;
an
he
goat
also;
and
a
king,
against
whom
there
is
no
rising
up.
030:032
If
thou
hast
done
foolishly
in
lifting
up
thyself,
or
if
thou
hast
thought
evil,
lay
thine
hand
upon
thy
mouth.
030:033
Surely
the
churning
of
milk
bringeth
forth
butter,
and
the
wringing
of
the
nose
bringeth
forth
blood:
so
the
forcing
of
wrath
bringeth
forth
strife.
031:001
The
words
of
king
Lemuel,
the
prophecy
that
his
mother
taught
him.
031:002
What,
my
son?
and
what,
the
son
of
my
womb?
and
what,
the
son
of
my
vows?
031:003
Give
not
thy
strength
unto
women,
nor
thy
ways
to
that
which
destroyeth
kings.
031:004
It
is
not
for
kings,
O
Lemuel,
it
is
not
for
kings
to
drink
wine;
nor
for
princes
strong
drink:
031:005
Lest
they
drink,
and
forget
the
law,
and
pervert
the
judgment
of
any
of
the
afflicted.
031:006
Give
strong
drink
unto
him
that
is
ready
to
perish,
and
wine
unto
those
that
be
of
heavy
hearts.
031:007
Let
him
drink,
and
forget
his
poverty,
and
remember
his
misery
no
more.
031:008
Open
thy
mouth
for
the
dumb
in
the
cause
of
all
such
as
are
appointed
to
destruction.
031:009
Open
thy
mouth,
judge
righteously,
and
plead
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
needy.
031:010
Who
can
find
a
virtuous
woman?
for
her
price
is
far
above
rubies.
031:011
The
heart
of
her
husband
doth
safely
trust
in
her,
so
that
he
shall
have
no
need
of
spoil.
031:012
She
will
do
him
good
and
not
evil
all
the
days
of
her
life.
031:013
She
seeketh
wool,
and
flax,
and
worketh
willingly
with
her
hands.
031:014
She
is
like
the
merchants'
ships;
she
bringeth
her
food
from
afar.
031:015
She
riseth
also
while
it
is
yet
night,
and
giveth
meat
to
her
household,
and
a
portion
to
her
maidens.
031:016
She
considereth
a
field,
and
buyeth
it:
with
the
fruit
of
her
hands
she
planteth
a
vineyard.
031:017
She
girdeth
her
loins
with
strength,
and
strengtheneth
her
arms.
031:018
She
perceiveth
that
her
merchandise
is
good:
her
candle
goeth
not
out
by
night.
031:019
She
layeth
her
hands
to
the
spindle,
and
her
hands
hold
the
distaff.
031:020
She
stretcheth
out
her
hand
to
the
poor;
yea,
she
reacheth
forth
her
hands
to
the
needy.
031:021
She
is
not
afraid
of
the
snow
for
her
household:
for
all
her
household
are
clothed
with
scarlet.
031:022
She
maketh
herself
coverings
of
tapestry;
her
clothing
is
silk
and
purple.
031:023
Her
husband
is
known
in
the
gates,
when
he
sitteth
among
the
elders
of
the
land.
031:024
She
maketh
fine
linen,
and
selleth
it;
and
delivereth
girdles
unto
the
merchant.
031:025
Strength
and
honour
are
her
clothing;
and
she
shall
rejoice
in
time
to
come.
031:026
She
openeth
her
mouth
with
wisdom;
and
in
her
tongue
is
the
law
of
kindness.
031:027
She
looketh
well
to
the
ways
of
her
household,
and
eateth
not
the
bread
of
idleness.
031:028
Her
children
arise
up,
and
call
her
blessed;
her
husband
also,
and
he
praiseth
her.
031:029
Many
daughters
have
done
virtuously,
but
thou
excellest
them
all.
031:030
Favour
is
deceitful,
and
beauty
is
vain:
but
a
woman
that
feareth
the
LORD,
she
shall
be
praised.
031:031
Give
her
of
the
fruit
of
her
hands;
and
let
her
own
works
praise
her
in
the
gates.
Book
21	Ecclesiastes
001:001
The
words
of
the
Preacher,
the
son
of
David,
king
in
Jerusalem.
001:002
Vanity
of
vanities,
saith
the
Preacher,
vanity
of
vanities;
all
is
vanity.
001:003
What
profit
hath
a
man
of
all
his
labour
which
he
taketh
under
the
sun?
001:004
One
generation
passeth
away,
and
another
generation
cometh:
but
the
earth
abideth
for
ever.
001:005
The
sun
also
ariseth,
and
the
sun
goeth
down,
and
hasteth
to
his
place
where
he
arose.
001:006
The
wind
goeth
toward
the
south,
and
turneth
about
unto
the
north;
it
whirleth
about
continually,
and
the
wind
returneth
again
according
to
his
circuits.
001:007
All
the
rivers
run
into
the
sea;
yet
the
sea
is
not
full;
unto
the
place
from
whence
the
rivers
come,
thither
they
return
again.
001:008
All
things
are
full
of
labour;
man
cannot
utter
it:
the
eye
is
not
satisfied
with
seeing,
nor
the
ear
filled
with
hearing.
001:009
The
thing
that
hath
been,
it
is
that
which
shall
be;
and
that
which
is
done
is
that
which
shall
be
done:
and
there
is
no
new
thing
under
the
sun.
001:010
Is
there
any
thing
whereof
it
may
be
said,
See,
this
is
new?
it
hath
been
already
of
old
time,
which
was
before
us.
001:011
There
is
no
remembrance
of
former
things;
neither
shall
there
be
any
remembrance
of
things
that
are
to
come
with
those
that
shall
come
after.
001:012
I
the
Preacher
was
king
over
Israel
in
Jerusalem.
001:013
And
I
gave
my
heart
to
seek
and
search
out
by
wisdom
concerning
all
things
that
are
done
under
heaven:
this
sore
travail
hath
God
given
to
the
sons
of
man
to
be
exercised
therewith.
001:014
I
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun;
and,
behold,
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit.
001:015
That
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight:
and
that
which
is
wanting
cannot
be
numbered.
001:016
I
communed
with
mine
own
heart,
saying,
Lo,
I
am
come
to
great
estate,
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they
that
have
been
before
me
in
Jerusalem:
yea,
my
heart
had
great
experience
of
wisdom
and
knowledge.
001:017
And
I
gave
my
heart
to
know
wisdom,
and
to
know
madness
and
folly:
I
perceived
that
this
also
is
vexation
of
spirit.
001:018
For
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief:
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow.
002:001
I
said
in
mine
heart,
Go
to
now,
I
will
prove
thee
with
mirth,
therefore
enjoy
pleasure:
and,
behold,
this
also
is
vanity.
002:002
I
said
of
laughter,
It
is
mad:
and
of
mirth,
What
doeth
it?
002:003
I
sought
in
mine
heart
to
give
myself
unto
wine,
yet
acquainting
mine
heart
with
wisdom;
and
to
lay
hold
on
folly,
till
I
might
see
what
was
that
good
for
the
sons
of
men,
which
they
should
do
under
the
heaven
all
the
days
of
