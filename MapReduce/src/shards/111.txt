their
life.
002:004
I
made
me
great
works;
I
builded
me
houses;
I
planted
me
vineyards:
002:005
I
made
me
gardens
and
orchards,
and
I
planted
trees
in
them
of
all
kind
of
fruits:
002:006
I
made
me
pools
of
water,
to
water
therewith
the
wood
that
bringeth
forth
trees:
002:007
I
got
me
servants
and
maidens,
and
had
servants
born
in
my
house;
also
I
had
great
possessions
of
great
and
small
cattle
above
all
that
were
in
Jerusalem
before
me:
002:008
I
gathered
me
also
silver
and
gold,
and
the
peculiar
treasure
of
kings
and
of
the
provinces:
I
gat
me
men
singers
and
women
singers,
and
the
delights
of
the
sons
of
men,
as
musical
instruments,
and
that
of
all
sorts.
002:009
So
I
was
great,
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
me
in
Jerusalem:
also
my
wisdom
remained
with
me.
002:010
And
whatsoever
mine
eyes
desired
I
kept
not
from
them,
I
withheld
not
my
heart
from
any
joy;
for
my
heart
rejoiced
in
all
my
labour:
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
labour.
002:011
Then
I
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
wrought,
and
on
the
labour
that
I
had
laboured
to
do:
and,
behold,
all
was
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit,
and
there
was
no
profit
under
the
sun.
002:012
And
I
turned
myself
to
behold
wisdom,
and
madness,
and
folly:
for
what
can
the
man
do
that
cometh
after
the
king?
even
that
which
hath
been
already
done.
002:013
Then
I
saw
that
wisdom
excelleth
folly,
as
far
as
light
excelleth
darkness.
002:014
The
wise
man's
eyes
are
in
his
head;
but
the
fool
walketh
in
darkness:
and
I
myself
perceived
also
that
one
event
happeneth
to
them
all.
002:015
Then
said
I
in
my
heart,
As
it
happeneth
to
the
fool,
so
it
happeneth
even
to
me;
and
why
was
I
then
more
wise?
Then
I
said
in
my
heart,
that
this
also
is
vanity.
002:016
For
there
is
no
remembrance
of
the
wise
more
than
of
the
fool
for
ever;
seeing
that
which
now
is
in
the
days
to
come
shall
all
be
forgotten.
And
how
dieth
the
wise
man?
as
the
fool.
002:017
Therefore
I
hated
life;
because
the
work
that
is
wrought
under
the
sun
is
grievous
unto
me:
for
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit.
002:018
Yea,
I
hated
all
my
labour
which
I
had
taken
under
the
sun:
because
I
should
leave
it
unto
the
man
that
shall
be
after
me.
002:019
And
who
knoweth
whether
he
shall
be
a
wise
man
or
a
fool?
yet
shall
he
have
rule
over
all
my
labour
wherein
I
have
laboured,
and
wherein
I
have
shewed
myself
wise
under
the
sun.
This
is
also
vanity.
002:020
Therefore
I
went
about
to
cause
my
heart
to
despair
of
all
the
labour
which
I
took
under
the
sun.
002:021
For
there
is
a
man
whose
labour
is
in
wisdom,
and
in
knowledge,
and
in
equity;
yet
to
a
man
that
hath
not
laboured
therein
shall
he
leave
it
for
his
portion.
This
also
is
vanity
and
a
great
evil.
002:022
For
what
hath
man
of
all
his
labour,
and
of
the
vexation
of
his
heart,
wherein
he
hath
laboured
under
the
sun?
002:023
For
all
his
days
are
sorrows,
and
his
travail
grief;
yea,
his
heart
taketh
not
rest
in
the
night.
This
is
also
vanity.
002:024
There
is
nothing
better
for
a
man,
than
that
he
should
eat
and
drink,
and
that
he
should
make
his
soul
enjoy
good
in
his
labour.
This
also
I
saw,
that
it
was
from
the
hand
of
God.
002:025
For
who
can
eat,
or
who
else
can
hasten
hereunto,
more
than
I?
002:026
For
God
giveth
to
a
man
that
is
good
in
his
sight
wisdom,
and
knowledge,
and
joy:
but
to
the
sinner
he
giveth
travail,
to
gather
and
to
heap
up,
that
he
may
give
to
him
that
is
good
before
God.
This
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit.
003:001
To
every
thing
there
is
a
season,
and
a
time
to
every
purpose
under
the
heaven:
003:002
A
time
to
be
born,
and
a
time
to
die;
a
time
to
plant,
and
a
time
to
pluck
up
that
which
is
planted;
003:003
A
time
to
kill,
and
a
time
to
heal;
a
time
to
break
down,
and
a
time
to
build
up;
003:004
A
time
to
weep,
and
a
time
to
laugh;
a
time
to
mourn,
and
a
time
to
dance;
003:005
A
time
to
cast
away
stones,
and
a
time
to
gather
stones
together;
a
time
to
embrace,
and
a
time
to
refrain
from
embracing;
003:006
A
time
to
get,
and
a
time
to
lose;
a
time
to
keep,
and
a
time
to
cast
away;
003:007
A
time
to
rend,
and
a
time
to
sew;
a
time
to
keep
silence,
and
a
time
to
speak;
003:008
A
time
to
love,
and
a
time
to
hate;
a
time
of
war,
and
a
time
of
peace.
003:009
What
profit
hath
he
that
worketh
in
that
wherein
he
laboureth?
003:010
I
have
seen
the
travail,
which
God
hath
given
to
the
sons
of
men
to
be
exercised
in
it.
003:011
He
hath
made
every
thing
beautiful
in
his
time:
also
he
hath
set
the
world
in
their
heart,
so
that
no
man
can
find
out
the
work
that
God
maketh
from
the
beginning
to
the
end.
003:012
I
know
that
there
is
no
good
in
them,
but
for
a
man
to
rejoice,
and
to
do
good
in
his
life.
003:013
And
also
that
every
man
should
eat
and
drink,
and
enjoy
the
good
of
all
his
labour,
it
is
the
gift
of
God.
003:014
I
know
that,
whatsoever
God
doeth,
it
shall
be
for
ever:
nothing
can
be
put
to
it,
nor
any
thing
taken
from
it:
and
God
doeth
it,
that
men
should
fear
before
him.
003:015
That
which
hath
been
is
now;
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
been;
and
God
requireth
that
which
is
past.
003:016
And
moreover
I
saw
under
the
sun
the
place
of
judgment,
that
wickedness
was
there;
and
the
place
of
righteousness,
that
iniquity
was
there.
003:017
I
said
in
mine
heart,
God
shall
judge
the
righteous
and
the
wicked:
for
there
is
a
time
there
for
every
purpose
and
for
every
work.
003:018
I
said
in
mine
heart
concerning
the
estate
of
the
sons
of
men,
that
God
might
manifest
them,
and
that
they
might
see
that
they
themselves
are
beasts.
003:019
For
that
which
befalleth
the
sons
of
men
befalleth
beasts;
even
one
thing
befalleth
them:
as
the
one
dieth,
so
dieth
the
other;
yea,
they
have
all
one
breath;
so
that
a
man
hath
no
preeminence
above
a
beast:
for
all
is
vanity.
003:020
All
go
unto
one
place;
all
are
of
the
dust,
and
all
turn
to
dust
again.
003:021
Who
knoweth
the
spirit
of
man
that
goeth
upward,
and
the
spirit
of
the
beast
that
goeth
downward
to
the
earth?
003:022
Wherefore
I
perceive
that
there
is
nothing
better,
than
that
a
man
should
rejoice
in
his
own
works;
for
that
is
his
portion:
for
who
shall
bring
him
to
see
what
shall
be
after
him?
004:001
So
I
returned,
and
considered
all
the
oppressions
that
are
done
under
the
sun:
and
behold
the
tears
of
such
as
were
oppressed,
and
they
had
no
comforter;
and
on
the
side
of
their
oppressors
there
was
power;
but
they
had
no
comforter.
004:002
Wherefore
I
praised
the
dead
which
are
already
dead
more
than
the
living
which
are
yet
alive.
004:003
Yea,
better
is
he
than
both
they,
which
hath
not
yet
been,
who
hath
not
seen
the
evil
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun.
004:004
Again,
I
considered
all
travail,
and
every
right
work,
that
for
this
a
man
is
envied
of
his
neighbour.
This
is
also
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit.
004:005
The
fool
foldeth
his
hands
together,
and
eateth
his
own
flesh.
004:006
Better
is
an
handful
with
quietness,
than
both
the
hands
full
with
travail
and
vexation
of
spirit.
004:007
Then
I
returned,
and
I
saw
vanity
under
the
sun.
004:008
There
is
one
alone,
and
there
is
not
a
second;
yea,
he
hath
neither
child
nor
brother:
yet
is
there
no
end
of
all
his
labour;
neither
is
his
eye
satisfied
with
riches;
neither
saith
he,
For
whom
do
I
labour,
and
bereave
my
soul
of
good?
This
is
also
vanity,
yea,
it
is
a
sore
travail.
004:009
Two
are
better
than
one;
because
they
have
a
good
reward
for
their
labour.
004:010
For
if
they
fall,
the
one
will
lift
up
his
fellow:
but
woe
to
him
that
is
alone
when
he
falleth;
for
he
hath
not
another
to
help
him
up.
004:011
Again,
if
two
lie
together,
then
they
have
heat:
but
how
can
one
be
warm
alone?
004:012
And
if
one
prevail
against
him,
two
shall
withstand
him;
and
a
threefold
cord
is
not
quickly
broken.
004:013
Better
is
a
poor
and
a
wise
child
than
an
old
and
foolish
king,
who
will
no
more
be
admonished.
004:014
For
out
of
prison
he
cometh
to
reign;
whereas
also
he
that
is
born
in
his
kingdom
becometh
poor.
004:015
I
considered
all
the
living
which
walk
under
the
sun,
with
the
second
child
that
shall
stand
up
in
his
stead.
004:016
There
is
no
end
of
all
the
people,
even
of
all
that
have
been
before
them:
they
also
that
come
after
shall
not
rejoice
in
him.
Surely
this
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit.
005:001
Keep
thy
foot
when
thou
goest
to
the
house
of
God,
and
be
more
ready
to
hear,
than
to
give
the
sacrifice
of
fools:
for
they
consider
not
that
they
do
evil.
005:002
Be
not
rash
with
thy
mouth,
and
let
not
thine
heart
be
hasty
to
utter
any
thing
before
God:
for
God
is
in
heaven,
and
thou
upon
earth:
therefore
let
thy
words
be
few.
005:003
For
a
dream
cometh
through
the
multitude
of
business;
and
a
fool's
voice
is
known
by
multitude
of
words.
005:004
When
thou
vowest
a
vow
unto
God,
defer
not
to
pay
it;
for
he
hath
no
pleasure
in
fools:
pay
that
which
thou
hast
vowed.
005:005
Better
is
it
that
thou
shouldest
not
vow,
than
that
thou
shouldest
vow
and
not
pay.
005:006
Suffer
not
thy
mouth
to
cause
thy
flesh
to
sin;
neither
say
thou
before
the
angel,
that
it
was
an
error:
wherefore
should
God
be
angry
at
thy
voice,
and
destroy
the
work
of
thine
hands?
005:007
For
in
the
multitude
of
dreams
and
many
words
there
are
also
divers
vanities:
but
fear
thou
God.
005:008
If
thou
seest
the
oppression
of
the
poor,
and
violent
perverting
of
judgment
and
justice
in
a
province,
marvel
not
at
the
matter:
for
he
that
is
higher
than
the
highest
regardeth;
and
there
be
higher
than
they.
005:009
Moreover
the
profit
of
the
earth
is
for
all:
the
king
himself
is
served
by
the
field.
005:010
He
that
loveth
silver
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
silver;
nor
he
that
loveth
abundance
with
increase:
this
is
also
vanity.
005:011
When
goods
increase,
they
are
increased
that
eat
them:
and
what
good
is
there
to
the
owners
thereof,
saving
the
beholding
of
them
with
their
eyes?
005:012
The
sleep
of
a
labouring
man
is
sweet,
whether
he
eat
little
or
much:
but
the
abundance
of
the
rich
will
not
suffer
him
to
sleep.
005:013
There
is
a
sore
evil
which
I
have
seen
under
the
sun,
namely,
riches
kept
for
the
owners
thereof
to
their
hurt.
005:014
But
those
riches
perish
by
evil
travail:
and
he
begetteth
a
son,
and
there
is
nothing
in
his
hand.
005:015
As
he
came
forth
of
his
mother's
womb,
naked
shall
he
return
to
go
as
he
came,
and
shall
take
nothing
of
his
labour,
which
he
may
carry
away
in
his
hand.
005:016
And
this
also
is
a
sore
evil,
that
in
all
points
as
he
came,
so
shall
he
go:
and
what
profit
hath
he
that
hath
laboured
for
the
wind?
005:017
All
his
days
also
he
eateth
in
darkness,
and
he
hath
much
sorrow
and
wrath
with
his
sickness.
005:018
Behold
that
which
I
have
seen:
it
is
good
and
comely
for
one
to
eat
and
to
drink,
and
to
enjoy
the
good
of
all
his
labour
that
he
taketh
under
the
sun
all
the
days
of
his
life,
which
God
giveth
him:
for
it
is
his
portion.
005:019
Every
man
also
to
whom
God
hath
given
riches
and
wealth,
and
hath
given
him
power
to
eat
thereof,
and
to
take
his
portion,
and
to
rejoice
in
his
labour;
this
is
the
gift
of
God.
005:020
For
he
shall
not
much
remember
the
days
of
his
life;
because
God
answereth
him
in
the
joy
of
his
heart.
006:001
There
is
an
evil
which
I
have
seen
under
the
sun,
and
it
is
common
among
men:
006:002
A
man
to
whom
God
hath
given
riches,
wealth,
and
honour,
so
that
he
wanteth
nothing
for
his
soul
of
all
that
he
desireth,
yet
God
giveth
him
not
power
to
eat
thereof,
but
a
stranger
eateth
it:
this
is
vanity,
and
it
is
an
evil
disease.
006:003
If
a
man
beget
an
hundred
children,
and
live
many
years,
so
that
the
days
of
his
years
be
many,
and
his
soul
be
not
filled
with
good,
and
also
that
he
have
no
burial;
I
say,
that
an
untimely
birth
is
better
than
he.
006:004
For
he
cometh
in
with
vanity,
and
departeth
in
darkness,
and
his
name
shall
be
covered
with
darkness.
006:005
Moreover
he
hath
not
seen
the
sun,
nor
known
any
thing:
this
hath
more
rest
than
the
other.
006:006
Yea,
though
he
live
a
thousand
years
twice
told,
yet
hath
he
seen
no
good:
do
not
all
go
to
one
place?
006:007
All
the
labour
of
man
is
for
his
mouth,
and
yet
the
appetite
is
not
filled.
006:008
For
what
hath
the
wise
more
than
the
fool?
what
hath
the
poor,
that
knoweth
to
walk
before
the
living?
006:009
Better
is
the
sight
of
the
eyes
than
the
wandering
of
the
desire:
this
is
also
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit.
006:010
That
which
hath
been
is
named
already,
and
it
is
known
that
it
is
man:
neither
may
he
contend
with
him
that
is
mightier
than
he.
006:011
Seeing
there
be
many
things
that
increase
vanity,
what
is
man
the
better?
006:012
For
who
knoweth
what
is
good
for
man
in
this
life,
all
the
days
of
his
vain
life
which
he
spendeth
as
a
shadow?
for
who
can
tell
a
man
what
shall
be
after
him
under
the
sun?
007:001
A
good
name
is
better
than
precious
ointment;
and
the
day
of
death
than
the
day
of
one's
birth.
007:002
It
is
better
to
go
to
the
house
of
mourning,
than
to
go
to
the
house
of
feasting:
for
that
is
the
end
of
all
men;
and
the
living
will
lay
it
to
his
heart.
007:003
Sorrow
is
better
than
laughter:
for
by
the
sadness
of
the
countenance
the
heart
is
made
better.
007:004
The
heart
of
the
wise
is
in
the
house
of
mourning;
but
the
heart
of
fools
is
in
the
house
of
mirth.
007:005
It
is
better
to
hear
the
rebuke
of
the
wise,
than
for
a
man
to
hear
the
song
of
fools.
007:006
For
as
the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot,
so
is
the
laughter
of
the
fool:
this
also
is
vanity.
007:007
Surely
oppression
maketh
a
wise
man
mad;
and
a
gift
destroyeth
the
heart.
007:008
Better
is
the
end
of
a
thing
than
the
beginning
thereof:
and
the
patient
in
spirit
is
better
than
the
proud
in
spirit.
007:009
Be
not
hasty
in
thy
spirit
to
be
angry:
for
anger
resteth
in
the
bosom
of
fools.
007:010
Say
not
thou,
What
is
the
cause
that
the
former
days
were
better
than
these?
for
thou
dost
not
enquire
wisely
concerning
this.
007:011
Wisdom
is
good
with
an
inheritance:
and
by
it
there
is
profit
to
them
that
see
the
sun.
007:012
For
wisdom
is
a
defence,
and
money
is
a
defence:
but
the
excellency
of
knowledge
is,
that
wisdom
giveth
life
to
them
that
have
it.
007:013
Consider
the
work
of
God:
for
who
can
make
that
straight,
which
he
hath
made
crooked?
007:014
In
the
day
of
prosperity
be
joyful,
but
in
the
day
of
adversity
consider:
God
also
hath
set
the
one
over
against
the
other,
to
the
end
that
man
should
find
nothing
after
him.
007:015
All
things
have
I
seen
in
the
days
of
my
vanity:
there
is
a
just
man
that
perisheth
in
his
righteousness,
and
there
is
a
wicked
man
that
prolongeth
his
life
in
his
wickedness.
007:016
Be
not
righteous
over
much;
neither
make
thyself
over
wise:
why
shouldest
thou
destroy
thyself
?
007:017
Be
not
over
much
wicked,
neither
be
thou
foolish:
why
shouldest
thou
die
before
thy
time?
007:018
It
is
good
that
thou
shouldest
take
hold
of
this;
yea,
also
from
this
withdraw
not
thine
hand:
for
he
that
feareth
God
shall
come
forth
of
them
all.
007:019
Wisdom
strengtheneth
the
wise
more
than
ten
mighty
men
which
are
in
the
city.
007:020
For
there
is
not
a
just
man
upon
earth,
that
doeth
good,
and
sinneth
not.
007:021
Also
take
no
heed
unto
all
words
that
are
spoken;
lest
thou
hear
thy
servant
curse
thee:
007:022
For
oftentimes
also
thine
own
heart
knoweth
that
thou
thyself
likewise
hast
cursed
others.
007:023
All
this
have
I
proved
by
wisdom:
I
said,
I
will
be
wise;
but
it
was
far
from
me.
007:024
That
which
is
far
off,
and
exceeding
deep,
who
can
find
it
out?
007:025
I
applied
mine
heart
to
know,
and
to
search,
and
to
seek
out
wisdom,
and
the
reason
of
things,
and
to
know
the
wickedness
of
folly,
even
of
foolishness
and
madness:
007:026
And
I
find
more
bitter
than
death
the
woman,
whose
heart
is
snares
and
nets,
and
her
hands
as
bands:
whoso
pleaseth
God
shall
escape
from
her;
but
the
sinner
shall
be
taken
by
her.
007:027
Behold,
this
have
I
found,
saith
the
preacher,
counting
one
by
one,
to
find
out
the
account:
007:028
Which
yet
my
soul
seeketh,
but
I
find
not:
one
man
among
a
thousand
have
I
found;
but
a
woman
among
all
those
have
I
not
found.
007:029
Lo,
this
only
have
I
found,
that
God
hath
made
man
upright;
but
they
have
sought
out
many
inventions.
008:001
Who
is
as
the
wise
man?
and
who
knoweth
the
interpretation
of
a
thing?
a
man's
wisdom
maketh
his
face
to
shine,
and
the
boldness
of
his
face
shall
be
changed.
008:002
I
counsel
thee
to
keep
the
king's
commandment,
and
that
in
regard
of
the
oath
of
God.
008:003
Be
not
hasty
to
go
out
of
his
sight:
stand
not
in
an
evil
thing;
for
he
doeth
whatsoever
pleaseth
him.
008:004
Where
the
word
of
a
king
is,
there
is
power:
and
who
may
say
unto
him,
What
doest
thou?
008:005
Whoso
keepeth
the
commandment
shall
feel
no
evil
thing:
and
a
wise
man's
heart
discerneth
both
time
and
judgment.
008:006
Because
to
every
purpose
there
is
time
and
judgment,
therefore
the
misery
of
man
is
great
upon
him.
008:007
For
he
knoweth
not
that
which
shall
be:
for
who
can
tell
him
when
it
shall
be?
008:008
There
is
no
man
that
hath
power
over
the
spirit
to
retain
the
spirit;
neither
hath
he
power
in
the
day
of
death:
and
there
is
no
discharge
in
that
war;
neither
shall
wickedness
deliver
those
that
are
given
to
it.
008:009
All
this
have
I
seen,
and
applied
my
heart
unto
every
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun:
there
is
a
time
wherein
one
man
ruleth
over
another
to
his
own
hurt.
008:010
And
so
I
saw
the
wicked
buried,
who
had
come
and
gone
from
the
place
of
the
holy,
and
they
were
forgotten
in
the
city
where
they
had
so
done:
this
is
also
vanity.
008:011
Because
sentence
against
an
evil
work
is
not
executed
speedily,
therefore
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
fully
set
in
them
to
do
evil.
008:012
Though
a
sinner
do
evil
an
hundred
times,
and
his
days
be
prolonged,
yet
surely
I
know
that
it
shall
be
well
with
them
that
fear
God,
which
fear
before
him:
008:013
But
it
shall
not
be
well
with
the
wicked,
neither
shall
he
prolong
his
days,
which
are
as
a
shadow;
because
he
feareth
not
before
God.
008:014
There
is
a
vanity
which
is
done
upon
the
earth;
that
there
be
just
men,
unto
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
wicked;
again,
there
be
wicked
men,
to
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
righteous:
I
said
that
this
also
is
vanity.
008:015
Then
I
commended
mirth,
because
a
man
hath
no
better
thing
under
the
sun,
than
to
eat,
and
to
drink,
and
to
be
merry:
for
that
shall
abide
with
him
of
his
labour
the
days
of
his
life,
which
God
giveth
him
under
the
sun.
008:016
When
I
applied
mine
heart
to
know
wisdom,
and
to
see
the
business
that
is
done
upon
the
earth:
(for
also
there
is
that
neither
day
nor
night
seeth
sleep
with
his
eyes:)
008:017
Then
I
beheld
all
the
work
of
God,
that
a
man
cannot
find
out
the
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun:
because
though
a
man
labour
to
seek
it
out,
yet
he
shall
not
find
it;
yea
farther;
though
a
wise
man
think
to
know
it,
yet
shall
he
not
be
able
to
find
it.
009:001
For
all
this
I
considered
in
my
heart
even
to
declare
all
this,
that
the
righteous,
and
the
wise,
and
their
works,
are
in
the
hand
of
God:
no
man
knoweth
either
love
or
hatred
by
all
that
is
before
them.
009:002
All
things
come
alike
to
all:
there
is
one
event
to
the
righteous,
and
to
the
wicked;
to
the
good
and
to
the
clean,
and
to
the
unclean;
to
him
that
sacrificeth,
and
to
him
that
sacrificeth
not:
as
is
the
good,
so
is
the
sinner;
and
he
that
sweareth,
as
he
that
feareth
an
oath.
009:003
This
is
an
evil
among
all
things
that
are
done
under
the
sun,
that
there
is
one
event
unto
all:
yea,
also
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
full
of
evil,
and
madness
is
in
their
heart
while
they
live,
and
after
that
they
go
to
the
dead.
009:004
For
to
him
that
is
joined
to
all
the
living
there
is
hope:
for
a
living
dog
is
better
than
a
dead
lion.
009:005
For
the
living
know
that
they
shall
die:
but
the
dead
know
not
any
thing,
neither
have
they
any
more
a
reward;
for
the
memory
of
them
is
forgotten.
009:006
Also
their
love,
and
their
hatred,
and
their
envy,
is
now
perished;
neither
have
they
any
more
a
portion
for
ever
in
any
thing
that
is
done
under
the
sun.
009:007
Go
thy
way,
eat
thy
bread
with
joy,
and
drink
thy
wine
with
a
merry
heart;
for
God
now
accepteth
thy
works.
009:008
Let
thy
garments
be
always
white;
and
let
thy
head
lack
no
ointment.
009:009
Live
joyfully
with
the
wife
whom
thou
lovest
all
the
days
of
the
life
of
thy
vanity,
which
he
hath
given
thee
under
the
sun,
all
the
days
of
thy
vanity:
for
that
is
thy
portion
in
this
life,
and
in
thy
labour
which
thou
takest
under
the
sun.
009:010
Whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do,
do
it
with
thy
might;
for
there
is
no
work,
nor
device,
nor
knowledge,
nor
wisdom,
in
the
grave,
whither
thou
goest.
009:011
I
returned,
and
saw
under
the
sun,
that
the
race
is
not
to
the
swift,
nor
the
battle
to
the
strong,
neither
yet
bread
to
the
wise,
nor
yet
riches
to
men
of
understanding,
nor
yet
favour
to
men
of
skill;
but
time
and
chance
happeneth
to
them
all.
009:012
For
man
also
knoweth
not
his
time:
as
the
fishes
that
are
taken
in
an
evil
net,
and
as
the
birds
that
are
caught
in
the
snare;
so
are
the
sons
of
men
snared
in
an
evil
time,
when
