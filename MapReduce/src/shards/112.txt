it
falleth
suddenly
upon
them.
009:013
This
wisdom
have
I
seen
also
under
the
sun,
and
it
seemed
great
unto
me:
009:014
There
was
a
little
city,
and
few
men
within
it;
and
there
came
a
great
king
against
it,
and
besieged
it,
and
built
great
bulwarks
against
it:
009:015
Now
there
was
found
in
it
a
poor
wise
man,
and
he
by
his
wisdom
delivered
the
city;
yet
no
man
remembered
that
same
poor
man.
009:016
Then
said
I,
Wisdom
is
better
than
strength:
nevertheless
the
poor
man's
wisdom
is
despised,
and
his
words
are
not
heard.
009:017
The
words
of
wise
men
are
heard
in
quiet
more
than
the
cry
of
him
that
ruleth
among
fools.
009:018
Wisdom
is
better
than
weapons
of
war:
but
one
sinner
destroyeth
much
good.
010:001
Dead
flies
cause
the
ointment
of
the
apothecary
to
send
forth
a
stinking
savour:
so
doth
a
little
folly
him
that
is
in
reputation
for
wisdom
and
honour.
010:002
A
wise
man's
heart
is
at
his
right
hand;
but
a
fool's
heart
at
his
left.
010:003
Yea
also,
when
he
that
is
a
fool
walketh
by
the
way,
his
wisdom
faileth
him,
and
he
saith
to
every
one
that
he
is
a
fool.
010:004
If
the
spirit
of
the
ruler
rise
up
against
thee,
leave
not
thy
place;
for
yielding
pacifieth
great
offences.
010:005
There
is
an
evil
which
I
have
seen
under
the
sun,
as
an
error
which
proceedeth
from
the
ruler:
010:006
Folly
is
set
in
great
dignity,
and
the
rich
sit
in
low
place.
010:007
I
have
seen
servants
upon
horses,
and
princes
walking
as
servants
upon
the
earth.
010:008
He
that
diggeth
a
pit
shall
fall
into
it;
and
whoso
breaketh
an
hedge,
a
serpent
shall
bite
him.
010:009
Whoso
removeth
stones
shall
be
hurt
therewith;
and
he
that
cleaveth
wood
shall
be
endangered
thereby.
010:010
If
the
iron
be
blunt,
and
he
do
not
whet
the
edge,
then
must
he
put
to
more
strength:
but
wisdom
is
profitable
to
direct.
010:011
Surely
the
serpent
will
bite
without
enchantment;
and
a
babbler
is
no
better.
010:012
The
words
of
a
wise
man's
mouth
are
gracious;
but
the
lips
of
a
fool
will
swallow
up
himself.
010:013
The
beginning
of
the
words
of
his
mouth
is
foolishness:
and
the
end
of
his
talk
is
mischievous
madness.
010:014
A
fool
also
is
full
of
words:
a
man
cannot
tell
what
shall
be;
and
what
shall
be
after
him,
who
can
tell
him?
010:015
The
labour
of
the
foolish
wearieth
every
one
of
them,
because
he
knoweth
not
how
to
go
to
the
city.
010:016
Woe
to
thee,
O
land,
when
thy
king
is
a
child,
and
thy
princes
eat
in
the
morning!
010:017
Blessed
art
thou,
O
land,
when
thy
king
is
the
son
of
nobles,
and
thy
princes
eat
in
due
season,
for
strength,
and
not
for
drunkenness!
010:018
By
much
slothfulness
the
building
decayeth;
and
through
idleness
of
the
hands
the
house
droppeth
through.
010:019
A
feast
is
made
for
laughter,
and
wine
maketh
merry:
but
money
answereth
all
things.
010:020
Curse
not
the
king,
no
not
in
thy
thought;
and
curse
not
the
rich
in
thy
bedchamber:
for
a
bird
of
the
air
shall
carry
the
voice,
and
that
which
hath
wings
shall
tell
the
matter.
011:001
Cast
thy
bread
upon
the
waters:
for
thou
shalt
find
it
after
many
days.
011:002
Give
a
portion
to
seven,
and
also
to
eight;
for
thou
knowest
not
what
evil
shall
be
upon
the
earth.
011:003
If
the
clouds
be
full
of
rain,
they
empty
themselves
upon
the
earth:
and
if
the
tree
fall
toward
the
south,
or
toward
the
north,
in
the
place
where
the
tree
falleth,
there
it
shall
be.
011:004
He
that
observeth
the
wind
shall
not
sow;
and
he
that
regardeth
the
clouds
shall
not
reap.
011:005
As
thou
knowest
not
what
is
the
way
of
the
spirit,
nor
how
the
bones
do
grow
in
the
womb
of
her
that
is
with
child:
even
so
thou
knowest
not
the
works
of
God
who
maketh
all.
011:006
In
the
morning
sow
thy
seed,
and
in
the
evening
withhold
not
thine
hand:
for
thou
knowest
not
whether
shall
prosper,
either
this
or
that,
or
whether
they
both
shall
be
alike
good.
011:007
Truly
the
light
is
sweet,
and
a
pleasant
thing
it
is
for
the
eyes
to
behold
the
sun:
011:008
But
if
a
man
live
many
years,
and
rejoice
in
them
all;
yet
let
him
remember
the
days
of
darkness;
for
they
shall
be
many.
All
that
cometh
is
vanity.
011:009
Rejoice,
O
young
man,
in
thy
youth;
and
let
thy
heart
cheer
thee
in
the
days
of
thy
youth,
and
walk
in
the
ways
of
thine
heart,
and
in
the
sight
of
thine
eyes:
but
know
thou,
that
for
all
these
things
God
will
bring
thee
into
judgment.
011:010
Therefore
remove
sorrow
from
thy
heart,
and
put
away
evil
from
thy
flesh:
for
childhood
and
youth
are
vanity.
012:001
Remember
now
thy
Creator
in
the
days
of
thy
youth,
while
the
evil
days
come
not,
nor
the
years
draw
nigh,
when
thou
shalt
say,
I
have
no
pleasure
in
them;
012:002
While
the
sun,
or
the
light,
or
the
moon,
or
the
stars,
be
not
darkened,
nor
the
clouds
return
after
the
rain:
012:003
In
the
day
when
the
keepers
of
the
house
shall
tremble,
and
the
strong
men
shall
bow
themselves,
and
the
grinders
cease
because
they
are
few,
and
those
that
look
out
of
the
windows
be
darkened,
012:004
And
the
doors
shall
be
shut
in
the
streets,
when
the
sound
of
the
grinding
is
low,
and
he
shall
rise
up
at
the
voice
of
the
bird,
and
all
the
daughters
of
musick
shall
be
brought
low;
012:005
Also
when
they
shall
be
afraid
of
that
which
is
high,
and
fears
shall
be
in
the
way,
and
the
almond
tree
shall
flourish,
and
the
grasshopper
shall
be
a
burden,
and
desire
shall
fail:
because
man
goeth
to
his
long
home,
and
the
mourners
go
about
the
streets:
012:006
Or
ever
the
silver
cord
be
loosed,
or
the
golden
bowl
be
broken,
or
the
pitcher
be
broken
at
the
fountain,
or
the
wheel
broken
at
the
cistern.
012:007
Then
shall
the
dust
return
to
the
earth
as
it
was:
and
the
spirit
shall
return
unto
God
who
gave
it.
012:008
Vanity
of
vanities,
saith
the
preacher;
all
is
vanity.
012:009
And
moreover,
because
the
preacher
was
wise,
he
still
taught
the
people
knowledge;
yea,
he
gave
good
heed,
and
sought
out,
and
set
in
order
many
proverbs.
012:010
The
preacher
sought
to
find
out
acceptable
words:
and
that
which
was
written
was
upright,
even
words
of
truth.
012:011
The
words
of
the
wise
are
as
goads,
and
as
nails
fastened
by
the
masters
of
assemblies,
which
are
given
from
one
shepherd.
012:012
And
further,
by
these,
my
son,
be
admonished:
of
making
many
books
there
is
no
end;
and
much
study
is
a
weariness
of
the
flesh.
012:013
Let
us
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter:
Fear
God,
and
keep
his
commandments:
for
this
is
the
whole
duty
of
man.
012:014
For
God
shall
bring
every
work
into
judgment,
with
every
secret
thing,
whether
it
be
good,
or
whether
it
be
evil.
Book
22	Song
of
Solomon
001:001
The
song
of
songs,
which
is
Solomon's.
001:002
Let
him
kiss
me
with
the
kisses
of
his
mouth:
for
thy
love
is
better
than
wine.
001:003
Because
of
the
savour
of
thy
good
ointments
thy
name
is
as
ointment
poured
forth,
therefore
do
the
virgins
love
thee.
001:004
Draw
me,
we
will
run
after
thee:
the
king
hath
brought
me
into
his
chambers:
we
will
be
glad
and
rejoice
in
thee,
we
will
remember
thy
love
more
than
wine:
the
upright
love
thee.
001:005
I
am
black,
but
comely,
O
ye
daughters
of
Jerusalem,
as
the
tents
of
Kedar,
as
the
curtains
of
Solomon.
001:006
Look
not
upon
me,
because
I
am
black,
because
the
sun
hath
looked
upon
me:
my
mother's
children
were
angry
with
me;
they
made
me
the
keeper
of
the
vineyards;
but
mine
own
vineyard
have
I
not
kept.
001:007
Tell
me,
O
thou
whom
my
soul
loveth,
where
thou
feedest,
where
thou
makest
thy
flock
to
rest
at
noon:
for
why
should
I
be
as
one
that
turneth
aside
by
the
flocks
of
thy
companions?
001:008
If
thou
know
not,
O
thou
fairest
among
women,
go
thy
way
forth
by
the
footsteps
of
the
flock,
and
feed
thy
kids
beside
the
shepherds'
tents.
001:009
I
have
compared
thee,
O
my
love,
to
a
company
of
horses
in
Pharaoh's
chariots.
001:010
Thy
cheeks
are
comely
with
rows
of
jewels,
thy
neck
with
chains
of
gold.
001:011
We
will
make
thee
borders
of
gold
with
studs
of
silver.
001:012
While
the
king
sitteth
at
his
table,
my
spikenard
sendeth
forth
the
smell
thereof.
001:013
A
bundle
of
myrrh
is
my
well-beloved
unto
me;
he
shall
lie
all
night
betwixt
my
breasts.
001:014
My
beloved
is
unto
me
as
a
cluster
of
camphire
in
the
vineyards
of
Engedi.
001:015
Behold,
thou
art
fair,
my
love;
behold,
thou
art
fair;
thou
hast
doves'
eyes.
001:016
Behold,
thou
art
fair,
my
beloved,
yea,
pleasant:
also
our
bed
is
green.
001:017
The
beams
of
our
house
are
cedar,
and
our
rafters
of
fir.
002:001
I
am
the
rose
of
Sharon,
and
the
lily
of
the
valleys.
002:002
As
the
lily
among
thorns,
so
is
my
love
among
the
daughters.
002:003
As
the
apple
tree
among
the
trees
of
the
wood,
so
is
my
beloved
among
the
sons.
I
sat
down
under
his
shadow
with
great
delight,
and
his
fruit
was
sweet
to
my
taste.
002:004
He
brought
me
to
the
banqueting
house,
and
his
banner
over
me
was
love.
002:005
Stay
me
with
flagons,
comfort
me
with
apples:
for
I
am
sick
of
love.
002:006
His
left
hand
is
under
my
head,
and
his
right
hand
doth
embrace
me.
002:007
I
charge
you,
O
ye
daughters
of
Jerusalem,
by
the
roes,
and
by
the
hinds
of
the
field,
that
ye
stir
not
up,
nor
awake
my
love,
till
he
please.
002:008
The
voice
of
my
beloved!
behold,
he
cometh
leaping
upon
the
mountains,
skipping
upon
the
hills.
002:009
My
beloved
is
like
a
roe
or
a
young
hart:
behold,
he
standeth
behind
our
wall,
he
looketh
forth
at
the
windows,
shewing
himself
through
the
lattice.
002:010
My
beloved
spake,
and
said
unto
me,
Rise
up,
my
love,
my
fair
one,
and
come
away.
002:011
For,
lo,
the
winter
is
past,
the
rain
is
over
and
gone;
002:012
The
flowers
appear
on
the
earth;
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come,
and
the
voice
of
the
turtle
is
heard
in
our
land;
002:013
The
fig
tree
putteth
forth
her
green
figs,
and
the
vines
with
the
tender
grape
give
a
good
smell.
Arise,
my
love,
my
fair
one,
and
come
away.
002:014
O
my
dove,
that
art
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock,
in
the
secret
places
of
the
stairs,
let
me
see
thy
countenance,
let
me
hear
thy
voice;
for
sweet
is
thy
voice,
and
thy
countenance
is
comely.
002:015
Take
us
the
foxes,
the
little
foxes,
that
spoil
the
vines:
for
our
vines
have
tender
grapes.
002:016
My
beloved
is
mine,
and
I
am
his:
he
feedeth
among
the
lilies.
002:017
Until
the
day
break,
and
the
shadows
flee
away,
turn,
my
beloved,
and
be
thou
like
a
roe
or
a
young
hart
upon
the
mountains
of
Bether.
003:001
By
night
on
my
bed
I
sought
him
whom
my
soul
loveth:
I
sought
him,
but
I
found
him
not.
003:002
I
will
rise
now,
and
go
about
the
city
in
the
streets,
and
in
the
broad
ways
I
will
seek
him
whom
my
soul
loveth:
I
sought
him,
but
I
found
him
not.
003:003
The
watchmen
that
go
about
the
city
found
me:
to
whom
I
said,
Saw
ye
him
whom
my
soul
loveth?
003:004
It
was
but
a
little
that
I
passed
from
them,
but
I
found
him
whom
my
soul
loveth:
I
held
him,
and
would
not
let
him
go,
until
I
had
brought
him
into
my
mother's
house,
and
into
the
chamber
of
her
that
conceived
me.
003:005
I
charge
you,
O
ye
daughters
of
Jerusalem,
by
the
roes,
and
by
the
hinds
of
the
field,
that
ye
stir
not
up,
nor
awake
my
love,
till
he
please.
003:006
Who
is
this
that
cometh
out
of
the
wilderness
like
pillars
of
smoke,
perfumed
with
myrrh
and
frankincense,
with
all
powders
of
the
merchant?
003:007
Behold
his
bed,
which
is
Solomon's;
threescore
valiant
men
are
about
it,
of
the
valiant
of
Israel.
003:008
They
all
hold
swords,
being
expert
in
war:
every
man
hath
his
sword
upon
his
thigh
because
of
fear
in
the
night.
003:009
King
Solomon
made
himself
a
chariot
of
the
wood
of
Lebanon.
003:010
He
made
the
pillars
thereof
of
silver,
the
bottom
thereof
of
gold,
the
covering
of
it
of
purple,
the
midst
thereof
being
paved
with
love,
for
the
daughters
of
Jerusalem.
003:011
Go
forth,
O
ye
daughters
of
Zion,
and
behold
king
Solomon
with
the
crown
wherewith
his
mother
crowned
him
in
the
day
of
his
espousals,
and
in
the
day
of
the
gladness
of
his
heart.
004:001
Behold,
thou
art
fair,
my
love;
behold,
thou
art
fair;
thou
hast
doves'
eyes
within
thy
locks:
thy
hair
is
as
a
flock
of
goats,
that
appear
from
mount
Gilead.
004:002
Thy
teeth
are
like
a
flock
of
sheep
that
are
even
shorn,
which
came
up
from
the
washing;
whereof
every
one
bear
twins,
and
none
is
barren
among
them.
004:003
Thy
lips
are
like
a
thread
of
scarlet,
and
thy
speech
is
comely:
thy
temples
are
like
a
piece
of
a
pomegranate
within
thy
locks.
004:004
Thy
neck
is
like
the
tower
of
David
builded
for
an
armoury,
whereon
there
hang
a
thousand
bucklers,
all
shields
of
mighty
men.
004:005
Thy
two
breasts
are
like
two
young
roes
that
are
twins,
which
feed
among
the
lilies.
004:006
Until
the
day
break,
and
the
shadows
flee
away,
I
will
get
me
to
the
mountain
of
myrrh,
and
to
the
hill
of
frankincense.
004:007
Thou
art
all
fair,
my
love;
there
is
no
spot
in
thee.
004:008
Come
with
me
from
Lebanon,
my
spouse,
with
me
from
Lebanon:
look
from
the
top
of
Amana,
from
the
top
of
Shenir
and
Hermon,
from
the
lions'
dens,
from
the
mountains
of
the
leopards.
004:009
Thou
hast
ravished
my
heart,
my
sister,
my
spouse;
thou
hast
ravished
my
heart
with
one
of
thine
eyes,
with
one
chain
of
thy
neck.
004:010
How
fair
is
thy
love,
my
sister,
my
spouse!
how
much
better
is
thy
love
than
wine!
and
the
smell
of
thine
ointments
than
all
spices!
004:011
Thy
lips,
O
my
spouse,
drop
as
the
honeycomb:
honey
and
milk
are
under
thy
tongue;
and
the
smell
of
thy
garments
is
like
the
smell
of
Lebanon.
004:012
A
garden
inclosed
is
my
sister,
my
spouse;
a
spring
shut
up,
a
fountain
sealed.
004:013
Thy
plants
are
an
orchard
of
pomegranates,
with
pleasant
fruits;
camphire,
with
spikenard,
004:014
Spikenard
and
saffron;
calamus
and
cinnamon,
with
all
trees
of
frankincense;
myrrh
and
aloes,
with
all
the
chief
spices:
004:015
A
fountain
of
gardens,
a
well
of
living
waters,
and
streams
from
Lebanon.
004:016
Awake,
O
north
wind;
and
come,
thou
south;
blow
upon
my
garden,
that
the
spices
thereof
may
flow
out.
Let
my
beloved
come
into
his
garden,
and
eat
his
pleasant
fruits.
005:001
I
am
come
into
my
garden,
my
sister,
my
spouse:
I
have
gathered
my
myrrh
with
my
spice;
I
have
eaten
my
honeycomb
with
my
honey;
I
have
drunk
my
wine
with
my
milk:
eat,
O
friends;
drink,
yea,
drink
abundantly,
O
beloved.
005:002
I
sleep,
but
my
heart
waketh:
it
is
the
voice
of
my
beloved
that
knocketh,
saying,
Open
to
me,
my
sister,
my
love,
my
dove,
my
undefiled:
for
my
head
is
filled
with
dew,
and
my
locks
with
the
drops
of
the
night.
005:003
I
have
put
off
my
coat;
how
shall
I
put
it
on?
I
have
washed
my
feet;
how
shall
I
defile
them?
005:004
My
beloved
put
in
his
hand
by
the
hole
of
the
door,
and
my
bowels
were
moved
for
him.
005:005
I
rose
up
to
open
to
my
beloved;
and
my
hands
dropped
with
myrrh,
and
my
fingers
with
sweet
smelling
myrrh,
upon
the
handles
of
the
lock.
005:006
I
opened
to
my
beloved;
but
my
beloved
had
withdrawn
himself,
and
was
gone:
my
soul
failed
when
he
spake:
I
sought
him,
but
I
could
not
find
him;
I
called
him,
but
he
gave
me
no
answer.
005:007
The
watchmen
that
went
about
the
city
found
me,
they
smote
me,
they
wounded
me;
the
keepers
of
the
walls
took
away
my
veil
from
me.
005:008
I
charge
you,
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem,
if
ye
find
my
beloved,
that
ye
tell
him,
that
I
am
sick
of
love.
005:009
What
is
thy
beloved
more
than
another
beloved,
O
thou
fairest
among
women?
what
is
thy
beloved
more
than
another
beloved,
that
thou
dost
so
charge
us?
005:010
My
beloved
is
white
and
ruddy,
the
chiefest
among
ten
thousand.
005:011
His
head
is
as
the
most
fine
gold,
his
locks
are
bushy,
and
black
as
a
raven.
005:012
His
eyes
are
as
the
eyes
of
doves
by
the
rivers
of
waters,
washed
with
milk,
and
fitly
set.
005:013
His
cheeks
are
as
a
bed
of
spices,
as
sweet
flowers:
his
lips
like
lilies,
dropping
sweet
smelling
myrrh.
005:014
His
hands
are
as
gold
rings
set
with
the
beryl:
his
belly
is
as
bright
ivory
overlaid
with
sapphires.
005:015
His
legs
are
as
pillars
of
marble,
set
upon
sockets
of
fine
gold:
his
countenance
is
as
Lebanon,
excellent
as
the
cedars.
005:016
His
mouth
is
most
sweet:
yea,
he
is
altogether
lovely.
This
is
my
beloved,
and
this
is
my
friend,
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem.
006:001
Whither
is
thy
beloved
gone,
O
thou
fairest
among
women?
whither
is
thy
beloved
turned
aside?
that
we
may
seek
him
with
thee.
006:002
My
beloved
is
gone
down
into
his
garden,
to
the
beds
of
spices,
to
feed
in
the
gardens,
and
to
gather
lilies.
006:003
I
am
my
beloved's,
and
my
beloved
is
mine:
he
feedeth
among
the
lilies.
006:004
Thou
art
beautiful,
O
my
love,
as
Tirzah,
comely
as
Jerusalem,
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners.
006:005
Turn
away
thine
eyes
from
me,
for
they
have
overcome
me:
thy
hair
is
as
a
flock
of
goats
that
appear
from
Gilead.
006:006
Thy
teeth
are
as
a
flock
of
sheep
which
go
up
from
the
washing,
whereof
every
one
beareth
twins,
and
there
is
not
one
barren
among
them.
006:007
As
a
piece
of
a
pomegranate
are
thy
temples
within
thy
locks.
006:008
There
are
threescore
queens,
and
fourscore
concubines,
and
virgins
without
number.
006:009
My
dove,
my
undefiled
is
but
one;
she
is
the
only
one
of
her
mother,
she
is
the
choice
one
of
her
that
bare
her.
The
daughters
saw
her,
and
blessed
her;
yea,
the
queens
and
the
concubines,
and
they
praised
her.
006:010
Who
is
she
that
looketh
forth
as
the
morning,
fair
as
the
moon,
clear
as
the
sun,
and
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners?
006:011
I
went
down
into
the
garden
of
nuts
to
see
the
fruits
of
the
valley,
and
to
see
whether
the
vine
flourished
and
the
pomegranates
budded.
006:012
Or
ever
I
was
aware,
my
soul
made
me
like
the
chariots
of
Amminadib.
006:013
Return,
return,
O
Shulamite;
return,
return,
that
we
may
look
upon
thee.
What
will
ye
see
in
the
Shulamite?
As
it
were
the
company
of
two
armies.
007:001
How
beautiful
are
thy
feet
with
shoes,
O
prince's
daughter!
the
joints
of
thy
thighs
are
like
jewels,
the
work
of
the
hands
of
a
cunning
workman.
007:002
Thy
navel
is
like
a
round
goblet,
which
wanteth
not
liquor:
thy
belly
is
like
an
heap
of
wheat
set
about
with
lilies.
007:003
Thy
two
breasts
are
like
two
young
roes
that
are
twins.
007:004
Thy
neck
is
as
a
tower
of
ivory;
thine
eyes
like
the
fishpools
in
Heshbon,
by
the
gate
of
Bathrabbim:
thy
nose
is
as
the
tower
of
Lebanon
which
looketh
toward
Damascus.
007:005
Thine
head
upon
thee
is
like
Carmel,
and
the
hair
of
thine
head
like
purple;
the
king
is
held
in
the
galleries.
007:006
How
fair
and
how
pleasant
art
thou,
O
love,
for
delights!
007:007
This
thy
stature
is
like
to
a
palm
tree,
and
thy
breasts
to
clusters
of
grapes.
007:008
I
said,
I
will
go
up
to
the
palm
tree,
I
will
take
hold
of
the
boughs
thereof:
now
also
thy
breasts
shall
be
as
clusters
of
the
vine,
and
the
smell
of
thy
nose
like
apples;
007:009
And
the
roof
of
thy
mouth
like
the
best
wine
for
my
beloved,
that
goeth
down
sweetly,
causing
the
lips
of
those
that
are
asleep
to
speak.
007:010
I
am
my
beloved's,
and
his
desire
is
toward
me.
007:011
Come,
my
beloved,
let
us
go
forth
into
the
field;
let
us
lodge
in
the
villages.
007:012
Let
us
get
up
early
to
the
vineyards;
let
us
see
if
the
vine
flourish,
whether
the
tender
grape
appear,
and
the
pomegranates
bud
forth:
there
will
I
give
thee
my
loves.
007:013
The
mandrakes
give
a
smell,
and
at
our
gates
are
all
manner
of
pleasant
fruits,
new
and
old,
which
I
have
laid
up
for
thee,
O
my
beloved.
008:001
O
that
thou
wert
as
my
brother,
that
sucked
the
breasts
of
my
mother!
when
I
should
find
thee
without,
I
would
kiss
thee;
yea,
I
should
not
be
despised.
008:002
I
would
lead
thee,
and
bring
thee
into
my
mother's
house,
who
would
instruct
me:
I
would
cause
thee
to
drink
of
spiced
wine
of
the
juice
of
my
pomegranate.
008:003
His
left
hand
should
be
under
my
head,
and
his
right
hand
should
embrace
me.
008:004
I
charge
you,
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem,
that
ye
stir
not
up,
nor
awake
my
love,
until
he
please.
008:005
Who
is
this
that
cometh
up
from
the
wilderness,
leaning
upon
her
beloved?
I
raised
thee
up
under
the
apple
tree:
there
thy
mother
brought
thee
forth:
there
she
brought
thee
forth
that
bare
thee.
008:006
Set
me
as
a
seal
upon
thine
heart,
as
a
seal
upon
thine
arm:
for
love
is
strong
as
death;
jealousy
is
cruel
as
the
grave:
the
coals
thereof
are
coals
of
fire,
which
hath
a
most
vehement
flame.
008:007
Many
waters
cannot
quench
love,
neither
can
the
floods
drown
it:
if
a
man
would
give
all
the
substance
of
his
house
for
love,
it
would
utterly
be
contemned.
008:008
We
have
a
little
sister,
and
she
hath
no
breasts:
what
shall
we
do
for
our
sister
in
the
day
when
she
shall
be
spoken
for?
008:009
If
she
be
a
wall,
we
will
build
upon
her
a
palace
of
silver:
and
if
she
be
a
door,
we
will
inclose
her
with
boards
of
cedar.
008:010
I
am
a
wall,
and
my
breasts
like
towers:
then
was
I
in
his
eyes
as
one
that
found
favour.
008:011
Solomon
had
a
vineyard
at
Baalhamon;
he
let
out
the
vineyard
unto
keepers;
every
one
for
the
fruit
thereof
was
to
bring
a
thousand
pieces
of
silver.
008:012
My
vineyard,
which
is
mine,
is
before
me:
thou,
O
Solomon,
must
have
a
thousand,
and
those
that
keep
the
fruit
thereof
two
hundred.
008:013
Thou
that
dwellest
in
the
gardens,
the
companions
hearken
to
thy
voice:
cause
me
to
hear
it.
008:014
Make
haste,
my
beloved,
and
be
thou
like
to
a
roe
or
to
a
young
hart
upon
the
mountains
of
spices.
Book
23	Isaiah
001:001
The
vision
of
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz,
which
he
saw
concerning
Judah
and
Jerusalem
in
the
days
of
Uzziah,
Jotham,
Ahaz,
and
Hezekiah,
kings
of
Judah.
001:002
Hear,
O
heavens,
and
give
ear,
O
earth:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken,
I
have
nourished
and
brought
up
children,
and
they
have
rebelled
against
me.
001:003
The
ox
knoweth
his
owner,
and
the
ass
his
master's
crib:
but
Israel
doth
not
know,
my
people
doth
not
consider.
001:004
Ah
sinful
nation,
a
people
laden
with
iniquity,
a
seed
of
evildoers,
children
that
