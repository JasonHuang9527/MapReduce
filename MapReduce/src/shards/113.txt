are
corrupters:
they
have
forsaken
the
LORD,
they
have
provoked
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
unto
anger,
they
are
gone
away
backward.
001:005
Why
should
ye
be
stricken
any
more?
ye
will
revolt
more
and
more:
the
whole
head
is
sick,
and
the
whole
heart
faint.
001:006
From
the
sole
of
the
foot
even
unto
the
head
there
is
no
soundness
in
it;
but
wounds,
and
bruises,
and
putrifying
sores:
they
have
not
been
closed,
neither
bound
up,
neither
mollified
with
ointment.
001:007
Your
country
is
desolate,
your
cities
are
burned
with
fire:
your
land,
strangers
devour
it
in
your
presence,
and
it
is
desolate,
as
overthrown
by
strangers.
001:008
And
the
daughter
of
Zion
is
left
as
a
cottage
in
a
vineyard,
as
a
lodge
in
a
garden
of
cucumbers,
as
a
besieged
city.
001:009
Except
the
LORD
of
hosts
had
left
unto
us
a
very
small
remnant,
we
should
have
been
as
Sodom,
and
we
should
have
been
like
unto
Gomorrah.
001:010
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
ye
rulers
of
Sodom;
give
ear
unto
the
law
of
our
God,
ye
people
of
Gomorrah.
001:011
To
what
purpose
is
the
multitude
of
your
sacrifices
unto
me?
saith
the
LORD:
I
am
full
of
the
burnt
offerings
of
rams,
and
the
fat
of
fed
beasts;
and
I
delight
not
in
the
blood
of
bullocks,
or
of
lambs,
or
of
he
goats.
001:012
When
ye
come
to
appear
before
me,
who
hath
required
this
at
your
hand,
to
tread
my
courts?
001:013
Bring
no
more
vain
oblations;
incense
is
an
abomination
unto
me;
the
new
moons
and
sabbaths,
the
calling
of
assemblies,
I
cannot
away
with;
it
is
iniquity,
even
the
solemn
meeting.
001:014
Your
new
moons
and
your
appointed
feasts
my
soul
hateth:
they
are
a
trouble
unto
me;
I
am
weary
to
bear
them.
001:015
And
when
ye
spread
forth
your
hands,
I
will
hide
mine
eyes
from
you:
yea,
when
ye
make
many
prayers,
I
will
not
hear:
your
hands
are
full
of
blood.
001:016
Wash
you,
make
you
clean;
put
away
the
evil
of
your
doings
from
before
mine
eyes;
cease
to
do
evil;
001:017
Learn
to
do
well;
seek
judgment,
relieve
the
oppressed,
judge
the
fatherless,
plead
for
the
widow.
001:018
Come
now,
and
let
us
reason
together,
saith
the
LORD:
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet,
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow;
though
they
be
red
like
crimson,
they
shall
be
as
wool.
001:019
If
ye
be
willing
and
obedient,
ye
shall
eat
the
good
of
the
land:
001:020
But
if
ye
refuse
and
rebel,
ye
shall
be
devoured
with
the
sword:
for
the
mouth
of
the
LORD
hath
spoken
it.
001:021
How
is
the
faithful
city
become
an
harlot!
it
was
full
of
judgment;
righteousness
lodged
in
it;
but
now
murderers.
001:022
Thy
silver
is
become
dross,
thy
wine
mixed
with
water:
001:023
Thy
princes
are
rebellious,
and
companions
of
thieves:
every
one
loveth
gifts,
and
followeth
after
rewards:
they
judge
not
the
fatherless,
neither
doth
the
cause
of
the
widow
come
unto
them.
001:024
Therefore
saith
the
LORD,
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
mighty
One
of
Israel,
Ah,
I
will
ease
me
of
mine
adversaries,
and
avenge
me
of
mine
enemies:
001:025
And
I
will
turn
my
hand
upon
thee,
and
purely
purge
away
thy
dross,
and
take
away
all
thy
tin:
001:026
And
I
will
restore
thy
judges
as
at
the
first,
and
thy
counsellors
as
at
the
beginning:
afterward
thou
shalt
be
called,
The
city
of
righteousness,
the
faithful
city.
001:027
Zion
shall
be
redeemed
with
judgment,
and
her
converts
with
righteousness.
001:028
And
the
destruction
of
the
transgressors
and
of
the
sinners
shall
be
together,
and
they
that
forsake
the
LORD
shall
be
consumed.
001:029
For
they
shall
be
ashamed
of
the
oaks
which
ye
have
desired,
and
ye
shall
be
confounded
for
the
gardens
that
ye
have
chosen.
001:030
For
ye
shall
be
as
an
oak
whose
leaf
fadeth,
and
as
a
garden
that
hath
no
water.
001:031
And
the
strong
shall
be
as
tow,
and
the
maker
of
it
as
a
spark,
and
they
shall
both
burn
together,
and
none
shall
quench
them.
002:001
The
word
that
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
saw
concerning
Judah
and
Jerusalem.
002:002
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days,
that
the
mountain
of
the
LORD's
house
shall
be
established
in
the
top
of
the
mountains,
and
shall
be
exalted
above
the
hills;
and
all
nations
shall
flow
unto
it.
002:003
And
many
people
shall
go
and
say,
Come
ye,
and
let
us
go
up
to
the
mountain
of
the
LORD,
to
the
house
of
the
God
of
Jacob;
and
he
will
teach
us
of
his
ways,
and
we
will
walk
in
his
paths:
for
out
of
Zion
shall
go
forth
the
law,
and
the
word
of
the
LORD
from
Jerusalem.
002:004
And
he
shall
judge
among
the
nations,
and
shall
rebuke
many
people:
and
they
shall
beat
their
swords
into
plowshares,
and
their
spears
into
pruninghooks:
nation
shall
not
lift
up
sword
against
nation,
neither
shall
they
learn
war
any
more.
002:005
O
house
of
Jacob,
come
ye,
and
let
us
walk
in
the
light
of
the
LORD.
002:006
Therefore
thou
hast
forsaken
thy
people
the
house
of
Jacob,
because
they
be
replenished
from
the
east,
and
are
soothsayers
like
the
Philistines,
and
they
please
themselves
in
the
children
of
strangers.
002:007
Their
land
also
is
full
of
silver
and
gold,
neither
is
there
any
end
of
their
treasures;
their
land
is
also
full
of
horses,
neither
is
there
any
end
of
their
chariots:
002:008
Their
land
also
is
full
of
idols;
they
worship
the
work
of
their
own
hands,
that
which
their
own
fingers
have
made:
002:009
And
the
mean
man
boweth
down,
and
the
great
man
humbleth
himself:
therefore
forgive
them
not.
002:010
Enter
into
the
rock,
and
hide
thee
in
the
dust,
for
fear
of
the
LORD,
and
for
the
glory
of
his
majesty.
002:011
The
lofty
looks
of
man
shall
be
humbled,
and
the
haughtiness
of
men
shall
be
bowed
down,
and
the
LORD
alone
shall
be
exalted
in
that
day.
002:012
For
the
day
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
shall
be
upon
every
one
that
is
proud
and
lofty,
and
upon
every
one
that
is
lifted
up;
and
he
shall
be
brought
low:
002:013
And
upon
all
the
cedars
of
Lebanon,
that
are
high
and
lifted
up,
and
upon
all
the
oaks
of
Bashan,
002:014
And
upon
all
the
high
mountains,
and
upon
all
the
hills
that
are
lifted
up,
002:015
And
upon
every
high
tower,
and
upon
every
fenced
wall,
002:016
And
upon
all
the
ships
of
Tarshish,
and
upon
all
pleasant
pictures.
002:017
And
the
loftiness
of
man
shall
be
bowed
down,
and
the
haughtiness
of
men
shall
be
made
low:
and
the
LORD
alone
shall
be
exalted
in
that
day.
002:018
And
the
idols
he
shall
utterly
abolish.
002:019
And
they
shall
go
into
the
holes
of
the
rocks,
and
into
the
caves
of
the
earth,
for
fear
of
the
LORD,
and
for
the
glory
of
his
majesty,
when
he
ariseth
to
shake
terribly
the
earth.
002:020
In
that
day
a
man
shall
cast
his
idols
of
silver,
and
his
idols
of
gold,
which
they
made
each
one
for
himself
to
worship,
to
the
moles
and
to
the
bats;
002:021
To
go
into
the
clefts
of
the
rocks,
and
into
the
tops
of
the
ragged
rocks,
for
fear
of
the
LORD,
and
for
the
glory
of
his
majesty,
when
he
ariseth
to
shake
terribly
the
earth.
002:022
Cease
ye
from
man,
whose
breath
is
in
his
nostrils:
for
wherein
is
he
to
be
accounted
of
?
003:001
For,
behold,
the
Lord,
the
LORD
of
hosts,
doth
take
away
from
Jerusalem
and
from
Judah
the
stay
and
the
staff,
the
whole
stay
of
bread,
and
the
whole
stay
of
water.
003:002
The
mighty
man,
and
the
man
of
war,
the
judge,
and
the
prophet,
and
the
prudent,
and
the
ancient,
003:003
The
captain
of
fifty,
and
the
honourable
man,
and
the
counsellor,
and
the
cunning
artificer,
and
the
eloquent
orator.
003:004
And
I
will
give
children
to
be
their
princes,
and
babes
shall
rule
over
them.
003:005
And
the
people
shall
be
oppressed,
every
one
by
another,
and
every
one
by
his
neighbour:
the
child
shall
behave
himself
proudly
against
the
ancient,
and
the
base
against
the
honourable.
003:006
When
a
man
shall
take
hold
of
his
brother
of
the
house
of
his
father,
saying,
Thou
hast
clothing,
be
thou
our
ruler,
and
let
this
ruin
be
under
thy
hand:
003:007
In
that
day
shall
he
swear,
saying,
I
will
not
be
an
healer;
for
in
my
house
is
neither
bread
nor
clothing:
make
me
not
a
ruler
of
the
people.
003:008
For
Jerusalem
is
ruined,
and
Judah
is
fallen:
because
their
tongue
and
their
doings
are
against
the
LORD,
to
provoke
the
eyes
of
his
glory.
003:009
The
shew
of
their
countenance
doth
witness
against
them;
and
they
declare
their
sin
as
Sodom,
they
hide
it
not.
Woe
unto
their
soul!
for
they
have
rewarded
evil
unto
themselves.
003:010
Say
ye
to
the
righteous,
that
it
shall
be
well
with
him:
for
they
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
their
doings.
003:011
Woe
unto
the
wicked!
it
shall
be
ill
with
him:
for
the
reward
of
his
hands
shall
be
given
him.
003:012
As
for
my
people,
children
are
their
oppressors,
and
women
rule
over
them.
O
my
people,
they
which
lead
thee
cause
thee
to
err,
and
destroy
the
way
of
thy
paths.
003:013
The
LORD
standeth
up
to
plead,
and
standeth
to
judge
the
people.
003:014
The
LORD
will
enter
into
judgment
with
the
ancients
of
his
people,
and
the
princes
thereof:
for
ye
have
eaten
up
the
vineyard;
the
spoil
of
the
poor
is
in
your
houses.
003:015
What
mean
ye
that
ye
beat
my
people
to
pieces,
and
grind
the
faces
of
the
poor?
saith
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts.
003:016
Moreover
the
LORD
saith,
Because
the
daughters
of
Zion
are
haughty,
and
walk
with
stretched
forth
necks
and
wanton
eyes,
walking
and
mincing
as
they
go,
and
making
a
tinkling
with
their
feet:
003:017
Therefore
the
LORD
will
smite
with
a
scab
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
daughters
of
Zion,
and
the
LORD
will
discover
their
secret
parts.
003:018
In
that
day
the
Lord
will
take
away
the
bravery
of
their
tinkling
ornaments
about
their
feet,
and
their
cauls,
and
their
round
tires
like
the
moon,
003:019
The
chains,
and
the
bracelets,
and
the
mufflers,
003:020
The
bonnets,
and
the
ornaments
of
the
legs,
and
the
headbands,
and
the
tablets,
and
the
earrings,
003:021
The
rings,
and
nose
jewels,
003:022
The
changeable
suits
of
apparel,
and
the
mantles,
and
the
wimples,
and
the
crisping
pins,
003:023
The
glasses,
and
the
fine
linen,
and
the
hoods,
and
the
vails.
003:024
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
instead
of
sweet
smell
there
shall
be
stink;
and
instead
of
a
girdle
a
rent;
and
instead
of
well
set
hair
baldness;
and
instead
of
a
stomacher
a
girding
of
sackcloth;
and
burning
instead
of
beauty.
003:025
Thy
men
shall
fall
by
the
sword,
and
thy
mighty
in
the
war.
003:026
And
her
gates
shall
lament
and
mourn;
and
she
being
desolate
shall
sit
upon
the
ground.
004:001
And
in
that
day
seven
women
shall
take
hold
of
one
man,
saying,
We
will
eat
our
own
bread,
and
wear
our
own
apparel:
only
let
us
be
called
by
thy
name,
to
take
away
our
reproach.
004:002
In
that
day
shall
the
branch
of
the
LORD
be
beautiful
and
glorious,
and
the
fruit
of
the
earth
shall
be
excellent
and
comely
for
them
that
are
escaped
of
Israel.
004:003
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
he
that
is
left
in
Zion,
and
he
that
remaineth
in
Jerusalem,
shall
be
called
holy,
even
every
one
that
is
written
among
the
living
in
Jerusalem:
004:004
When
the
Lord
shall
have
washed
away
the
filth
of
the
daughters
of
Zion,
and
shall
have
purged
the
blood
of
Jerusalem
from
the
midst
thereof
by
the
spirit
of
judgment,
and
by
the
spirit
of
burning.
004:005
And
the
LORD
will
create
upon
every
dwelling
place
of
mount
Zion,
and
upon
her
assemblies,
a
cloud
and
smoke
by
day,
and
the
shining
of
a
flaming
fire
by
night:
for
upon
all
the
glory
shall
be
a
defence.
004:006
And
there
shall
be
a
tabernacle
for
a
shadow
in
the
day
time
from
the
heat,
and
for
a
place
of
refuge,
and
for
a
covert
from
storm
and
from
rain.
005:001
Now
will
I
sing
to
my
wellbeloved
a
song
of
my
beloved
touching
his
vineyard.
My
wellbeloved
hath
a
vineyard
in
a
very
fruitful
hill:
005:002
And
he
fenced
it,
and
gathered
out
the
stones
thereof,
and
planted
it
with
the
choicest
vine,
and
built
a
tower
in
the
midst
of
it,
and
also
made
a
winepress
therein:
and
he
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes,
and
it
brought
forth
wild
grapes.
005:003
And
now,
O
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
and
men
of
Judah,
judge,
I
pray
you,
betwixt
me
and
my
vineyard.
005:004
What
could
have
been
done
more
to
my
vineyard,
that
I
have
not
done
in
it?
wherefore,
when
I
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes,
brought
it
forth
wild
grapes?
005:005
And
now
go
to;
I
will
tell
you
what
I
will
do
to
my
vineyard:
I
will
take
away
the
hedge
thereof,
and
it
shall
be
eaten
up;
and
break
down
the
wall
thereof,
and
it
shall
be
trodden
down:
005:006
And
I
will
lay
it
waste:
it
shall
not
be
pruned,
nor
digged;
but
there
shall
come
up
briers
and
thorns:
I
will
also
command
the
clouds
that
they
rain
no
rain
upon
it.
005:007
For
the
vineyard
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
is
the
house
of
Israel,
and
the
men
of
Judah
his
pleasant
plant:
and
he
looked
for
judgment,
but
behold
oppression;
for
righteousness,
but
behold
a
cry.
005:008
Woe
unto
them
that
join
house
to
house,
that
lay
field
to
field,
till
there
be
no
place,
that
they
may
be
placed
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
earth!
005:009
In
mine
ears
said
the
LORD
of
hosts,
Of
a
truth
many
houses
shall
be
desolate,
even
great
and
fair,
without
inhabitant.
005:010
Yea,
ten
acres
of
vineyard
shall
yield
one
bath,
and
the
seed
of
an
homer
shall
yield
an
ephah.
005:011
Woe
unto
them
that
rise
up
early
in
the
morning,
that
they
may
follow
strong
drink;
that
continue
until
night,
till
wine
inflame
them!
005:012
And
the
harp,
and
the
viol,
the
tabret,
and
pipe,
and
wine,
are
in
their
feasts:
but
they
regard
not
the
work
of
the
LORD,
neither
consider
the
operation
of
his
hands.
005:013
Therefore
my
people
are
gone
into
captivity,
because
they
have
no
knowledge:
and
their
honourable
men
are
famished,
and
their
multitude
dried
up
with
thirst.
005:014
Therefore
hell
hath
enlarged
herself,
and
opened
her
mouth
without
measure:
and
their
glory,
and
their
multitude,
and
their
pomp,
and
he
that
rejoiceth,
shall
descend
into
it.
005:015
And
the
mean
man
shall
be
brought
down,
and
the
mighty
man
shall
be
humbled,
and
the
eyes
of
the
lofty
shall
be
humbled:
005:016
But
the
LORD
of
hosts
shall
be
exalted
in
judgment,
and
God
that
is
holy
shall
be
sanctified
in
righteousness.
005:017
Then
shall
the
lambs
feed
after
their
manner,
and
the
waste
places
of
the
fat
ones
shall
strangers
eat.
005:018
Woe
unto
them
that
draw
iniquity
with
cords
of
vanity,
and
sin
as
it
were
with
a
cart
rope:
005:019
That
say,
Let
him
make
speed,
and
hasten
his
work,
that
we
may
see
it:
and
let
the
counsel
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
draw
nigh
and
come,
that
we
may
know
it!
005:020
Woe
unto
them
that
call
evil
good,
and
good
evil;
that
put
darkness
for
light,
and
light
for
darkness;
that
put
bitter
for
sweet,
and
sweet
for
bitter!
005:021
Woe
unto
them
that
are
wise
in
their
own
eyes,
and
prudent
in
their
own
sight!
005:022
Woe
unto
them
that
are
mighty
to
drink
wine,
and
men
of
strength
to
mingle
strong
drink:
005:023
Which
justify
the
wicked
for
reward,
and
take
away
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
from
him!
005:024
Therefore
as
the
fire
devoureth
the
stubble,
and
the
flame
consumeth
the
chaff,
so
their
root
shall
be
as
rottenness,
and
their
blossom
shall
go
up
as
dust:
because
they
have
cast
away
the
law
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
despised
the
word
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
005:025
Therefore
is
the
anger
of
the
LORD
kindled
against
his
people,
and
he
hath
stretched
forth
his
hand
against
them,
and
hath
smitten
them:
and
the
hills
did
tremble,
and
their
carcases
were
torn
in
the
midst
of
the
streets.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away,
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still.
005:026
And
he
will
lift
up
an
ensign
to
the
nations
from
far,
and
will
hiss
unto
them
from
the
end
of
the
earth:
and,
behold,
they
shall
come
with
speed
swiftly:
005:027
None
shall
be
weary
nor
stumble
among
them;
none
shall
slumber
nor
sleep;
neither
shall
the
girdle
of
their
loins
be
loosed,
nor
the
latchet
of
their
shoes
be
broken:
005:028
Whose
arrows
are
sharp,
and
all
their
bows
bent,
their
horses'
hoofs
shall
be
counted
like
flint,
and
their
wheels
like
a
whirlwind:
005:029
Their
roaring
shall
be
like
a
lion,
they
shall
roar
like
young
lions:
yea,
they
shall
roar,
and
lay
hold
of
the
prey,
and
shall
carry
it
away
safe,
and
none
shall
deliver
it.
005:030
And
in
that
day
they
shall
roar
against
them
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea:
and
if
one
look
unto
the
land,
behold
darkness
and
sorrow,
and
the
light
is
darkened
in
the
heavens
thereof.
006:001
In
the
year
that
king
Uzziah
died
I
saw
also
the
LORD
sitting
upon
a
throne,
high
and
lifted
up,
and
his
train
filled
the
temple.
006:002
Above
it
stood
the
seraphims:
each
one
had
six
wings;
with
twain
he
covered
his
face,
and
with
twain
he
covered
his
feet,
and
with
twain
he
did
fly.
006:003
And
one
cried
unto
another,
and
said,
Holy,
holy,
holy,
is
the
LORD
of
hosts:
the
whole
earth
is
full
of
his
glory.
006:004
And
the
posts
of
the
door
moved
at
the
voice
of
him
that
cried,
and
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke.
006:005
Then
said
I,
Woe
is
me!
for
I
am
undone;
because
I
am
a
man
of
unclean
lips,
and
I
dwell
in
the
midst
of
a
people
of
unclean
lips:
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
King,
the
LORD
of
hosts.
006:006
Then
flew
one
of
the
seraphims
unto
me,
having
a
live
coal
in
his
hand,
which
he
had
taken
with
the
tongs
from
off
the
altar:
006:007
And
he
laid
it
upon
my
mouth,
and
said,
Lo,
this
hath
touched
thy
lips;
and
thine
iniquity
is
taken
away,
and
thy
sin
purged.
006:008
Also
I
heard
the
voice
of
the
Lord,
saying,
Whom
shall
I
send,
and
who
will
go
for
us?
Then
said
I,
Here
am
I;
send
me.
006:009
And
he
said,
Go,
and
tell
this
people,
Hear
ye
indeed,
but
understand
not;
and
see
ye
indeed,
but
perceive
not.
006:010
Make
the
heart
of
this
people
fat,
and
make
their
ears
heavy,
and
shut
their
eyes;
lest
they
see
with
their
eyes,
and
hear
with
their
ears,
and
understand
with
their
heart,
and
convert,
and
be
healed.
006:011
Then
said
I,
Lord,
how
long?
And
he
answered,
Until
the
cities
be
wasted
without
inhabitant,
and
the
houses
without
man,
and
the
land
be
utterly
desolate,
006:012
And
the
LORD
have
removed
men
far
away,
and
there
be
a
great
forsaking
in
the
midst
of
the
land.
006:013
But
yet
in
it
shall
be
a
tenth,
and
it
shall
return,
and
shall
be
eaten:
as
a
teil
tree,
and
as
an
oak,
whose
substance
is
in
them,
when
they
cast
their
leaves:
so
the
holy
seed
shall
be
the
substance
thereof.
007:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Ahaz
the
son
of
Jotham,
the
son
of
Uzziah,
king
of
Judah,
that
Rezin
the
king
of
Syria,
and
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah,
king
of
Israel,
went
up
toward
Jerusalem
to
war
against
it,
but
could
not
prevail
against
it.
007:002
And
it
was
told
the
house
of
David,
saying,
Syria
is
confederate
with
Ephraim.
And
his
heart
was
moved,
and
the
heart
of
his
people,
as
the
trees
of
the
wood
are
moved
with
the
wind.
007:003
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
Isaiah,
Go
forth
now
to
meet
Ahaz,
thou,
and
Shearjashub
thy
son,
at
the
end
of
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller's
field;
007:004
And
say
unto
him,
Take
heed,
and
be
quiet;
fear
not,
neither
be
fainthearted
for
the
two
tails
of
these
smoking
firebrands,
for
the
fierce
anger
of
Rezin
with
Syria,
and
of
the
son
of
Remaliah.
007:005
Because
Syria,
Ephraim,
and
the
son
of
Remaliah,
have
taken
evil
counsel
against
thee,
saying,
007:006
Let
us
go
up
against
Judah,
and
vex
it,
and
let
us
make
a
breach
therein
for
us,
and
set
a
king
in
the
midst
of
it,
even
the
son
of
Tabeal:
007:007
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
It
shall
not
stand,
neither
shall
it
come
to
pass.
007:008
For
the
head
of
Syria
is
Damascus,
and
the
head
of
Damascus
is
Rezin;
and
within
threescore
and
five
years
shall
Ephraim
be
broken,
that
it
be
not
a
people.
007:009
And
the
head
of
Ephraim
is
Samaria,
and
the
head
of
Samaria
is
Remaliah's
son.
If
ye
will
not
believe,
surely
ye
shall
not
be
established.
007:010
Moreover
the
LORD
spake
again
unto
Ahaz,
saying,
007:011
Ask
thee
a
sign
of
the
LORD
thy
God;
ask
it
either
in
the
depth,
or
in
the
height
above.
007:012
But
Ahaz
said,
I
will
not
ask,
neither
will
I
tempt
the
LORD.
007:013
And
he
said,
Hear
ye
now,
O
house
of
David;
Is
it
a
small
thing
for
you
to
weary
men,
but
will
ye
weary
my
God
also?
007:014
Therefore
the
Lord
himself
shall
give
you
a
sign;
Behold,
a
virgin
shall
conceive,
and
bear
a
son,
and
shall
call
his
name
Immanuel.
007:015
Butter
and
honey
shall
he
eat,
that
he
may
know
to
refuse
the
evil,
and
choose
the
good.
007:016
For
before
the
child
shall
know
to
refuse
the
evil,
and
choose
the
good,
the
land
that
thou
abhorrest
shall
be
forsaken
of
both
her
kings.
007:017
The
LORD
shall
bring
upon
thee,
and
upon
thy
people,
and
upon
thy
father's
house,
days
that
have
not
come,
from
the
day
that
Ephraim
departed
from
Judah;
even
the
king
of
Assyria.
007:018
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
the
LORD
shall
hiss
for
the
fly
that
is
in
the
uttermost
part
of
the
rivers
of
Egypt,
and
for
the
bee
that
is
in
the
land
of
Assyria.
007:019
And
they
shall
come,
and
shall
rest
all
of
them
in
the
desolate
valleys,
and
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks,
and
upon
all
thorns,
and
upon
all
bushes.
007:020
In
the
same
day
shall
the
Lord
shave
with
a
razor
that
is
hired,
namely,
by
them
beyond
the
river,
by
the
king
of
Assyria,
the
head,
and
the
hair
of
the
feet:
and
it
shall
also
consume
the
beard.
007:021
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
a
man
shall
nourish
a
young
cow,
and
two
sheep;
007:022
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
for
the
abundance
of
milk
that
they
shall
give
he
shall
eat
butter:
for
butter
and
honey
shall
every
one
eat
that
is
left
in
the
land.
007:023
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
every
place
shall
be,
where
there
were
a
thousand
vines
at
a
thousand
silverlings,
it
shall
even
be
for
briers
and
thorns.
007:024
With
arrows
and
with
bows
shall
men
come
thither;
because
all
the
land
shall
become
briers
and
thorns.
007:025
And
on
all
hills
that
shall
be
digged
with
the
mattock,
there
shall
not
come
thither
the
fear
of
briers
and
thorns:
but
it
shall
be
for
the
sending
