forth
of
oxen,
and
for
the
treading
of
lesser
cattle.
008:001
Moreover
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Take
thee
a
great
roll,
and
write
in
it
with
a
man's
pen
concerning
Mahershalalhashbaz.
008:002
And
I
took
unto
me
faithful
witnesses
to
record,
Uriah
the
priest,
and
Zechariah
the
son
of
Jeberechiah.
008:003
And
I
went
unto
the
prophetess;
and
she
conceived,
and
bare
a
son.
Then
said
the
LORD
to
me,
Call
his
name
Mahershalalhashbaz.
008:004
For
before
the
child
shall
have
knowledge
to
cry,
My
father,
and
my
mother,
the
riches
of
Damascus
and
the
spoil
of
Samaria
shall
be
taken
away
before
the
king
of
Assyria.
008:005
The
LORD
spake
also
unto
me
again,
saying,
008:006
Forasmuch
as
this
people
refuseth
the
waters
of
Shiloah
that
go
softly,
and
rejoice
in
Rezin
and
Remaliah's
son;
008:007
Now
therefore,
behold,
the
Lord
bringeth
up
upon
them
the
waters
of
the
river,
strong
and
many,
even
the
king
of
Assyria,
and
all
his
glory:
and
he
shall
come
up
over
all
his
channels,
and
go
over
all
his
banks:
008:008
And
he
shall
pass
through
Judah;
he
shall
overflow
and
go
over,
he
shall
reach
even
to
the
neck;
and
the
stretching
out
of
his
wings
shall
fill
the
breadth
of
thy
land,
O
Immanuel.
008:009
Associate
yourselves,
O
ye
people,
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces;
and
give
ear,
all
ye
of
far
countries:
gird
yourselves,
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces;
gird
yourselves,
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces.
008:010
Take
counsel
together,
and
it
shall
come
to
nought;
speak
the
word,
and
it
shall
not
stand:
for
God
is
with
us.
008:011
For
the
LORD
spake
thus
to
me
with
a
strong
hand,
and
instructed
me
that
I
should
not
walk
in
the
way
of
this
people,
saying,
008:012
Say
ye
not,
A
confederacy,
to
all
them
to
whom
this
people
shall
say,
A
confederacy;
neither
fear
ye
their
fear,
nor
be
afraid.
008:013
Sanctify
the
LORD
of
hosts
himself;
and
let
him
be
your
fear,
and
let
him
be
your
dread.
008:014
And
he
shall
be
for
a
sanctuary;
but
for
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
for
a
rock
of
offence
to
both
the
houses
of
Israel,
for
a
gin
and
for
a
snare
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem.
008:015
And
many
among
them
shall
stumble,
and
fall,
and
be
broken,
and
be
snared,
and
be
taken.
008:016
Bind
up
the
testimony,
seal
the
law
among
my
disciples.
008:017
And
I
will
wait
upon
the
LORD,
that
hideth
his
face
from
the
house
of
Jacob,
and
I
will
look
for
him.
008:018
Behold,
I
and
the
children
whom
the
LORD
hath
given
me
are
for
signs
and
for
wonders
in
Israel
from
the
LORD
of
hosts,
which
dwelleth
in
mount
Zion.
008:019
And
when
they
shall
say
unto
you,
Seek
unto
them
that
have
familiar
spirits,
and
unto
wizards
that
peep,
and
that
mutter:
should
not
a
people
seek
unto
their
God?
for
the
living
to
the
dead?
008:020
To
the
law
and
to
the
testimony:
if
they
speak
not
according
to
this
word,
it
is
because
there
is
no
light
in
them.
008:021
And
they
shall
pass
through
it,
hardly
bestead
and
hungry:
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
when
they
shall
be
hungry,
they
shall
fret
themselves,
and
curse
their
king
and
their
God,
and
look
upward.
008:022
And
they
shall
look
unto
the
earth;
and
behold
trouble
and
darkness,
dimness
of
anguish;
and
they
shall
be
driven
to
darkness.
009:001
Nevertheless
the
dimness
shall
not
be
such
as
was
in
her
vexation,
when
at
the
first
he
lightly
afflicted
the
land
of
Zebulun
and
the
land
of
Naphtali,
and
afterward
did
more
grievously
afflict
her
by
the
way
of
the
sea,
beyond
Jordan,
in
Galilee
of
the
nations.
009:002
The
people
that
walked
in
darkness
have
seen
a
great
light:
they
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
shadow
of
death,
upon
them
hath
the
light
shined.
009:003
Thou
hast
multiplied
the
nation,
and
not
increased
the
joy:
they
joy
before
thee
according
to
the
joy
in
harvest,
and
as
men
rejoice
when
they
divide
the
spoil.
009:004
For
thou
hast
broken
the
yoke
of
his
burden,
and
the
staff
of
his
shoulder,
the
rod
of
his
oppressor,
as
in
the
day
of
Midian.
009:005
For
every
battle
of
the
warrior
is
with
confused
noise,
and
garments
rolled
in
blood;
but
this
shall
be
with
burning
and
fuel
of
fire.
009:006
For
unto
us
a
child
is
born,
unto
us
a
son
is
given:
and
the
government
shall
be
upon
his
shoulder:
and
his
name
shall
be
called
Wonderful,
Counsellor,
The
mighty
God,
The
everlasting
Father,
The
Prince
of
Peace.
009:007
Of
the
increase
of
his
government
and
peace
there
shall
be
no
end,
upon
the
throne
of
David,
and
upon
his
kingdom,
to
order
it,
and
to
establish
it
with
judgment
and
with
justice
from
henceforth
even
for
ever.
The
zeal
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
will
perform
this.
009:008
The
Lord
sent
a
word
into
Jacob,
and
it
hath
lighted
upon
Israel.
009:009
And
all
the
people
shall
know,
even
Ephraim
and
the
inhabitant
of
Samaria,
that
say
in
the
pride
and
stoutness
of
heart,
009:010
The
bricks
are
fallen
down,
but
we
will
build
with
hewn
stones:
the
sycomores
are
cut
down,
but
we
will
change
them
into
cedars.
009:011
Therefore
the
LORD
shall
set
up
the
adversaries
of
Rezin
against
him,
and
join
his
enemies
together;
009:012
The
Syrians
before,
and
the
Philistines
behind;
and
they
shall
devour
Israel
with
open
mouth.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away,
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still.
009:013
For
the
people
turneth
not
unto
him
that
smiteth
them,
neither
do
they
seek
the
LORD
of
hosts.
009:014
Therefore
the
LORD
will
cut
off
from
Israel
head
and
tail,
branch
and
rush,
in
one
day.
009:015
The
ancient
and
honourable,
he
is
the
head;
and
the
prophet
that
teacheth
lies,
he
is
the
tail.
009:016
For
the
leaders
of
this
people
cause
them
to
err;
and
they
that
are
led
of
them
are
destroyed.
009:017
Therefore
the
LORD
shall
have
no
joy
in
their
young
men,
neither
shall
have
mercy
on
their
fatherless
and
widows:
for
every
one
is
an
hypocrite
and
an
evildoer,
and
every
mouth
speaketh
folly.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away,
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still.
009:018
For
wickedness
burneth
as
the
fire:
it
shall
devour
the
briers
and
thorns,
and
shall
kindle
in
the
thickets
of
the
forest,
and
they
shall
mount
up
like
the
lifting
up
of
smoke.
009:019
Through
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
is
the
land
darkened,
and
the
people
shall
be
as
the
fuel
of
the
fire:
no
man
shall
spare
his
brother.
009:020
And
he
shall
snatch
on
the
right
hand,
and
be
hungry;
and
he
shall
eat
on
the
left
hand,
and
they
shall
not
be
satisfied:
they
shall
eat
every
man
the
flesh
of
his
own
arm:
009:021
Manasseh,
Ephraim;
and
Ephraim,
Manasseh:
and
they
together
shall
be
against
Judah.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away,
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still.
010:001
Woe
unto
them
that
decree
unrighteous
decrees,
and
that
write
grievousness
which
they
have
prescribed;
010:002
To
turn
aside
the
needy
from
judgment,
and
to
take
away
the
right
from
the
poor
of
my
people,
that
widows
may
be
their
prey,
and
that
they
may
rob
the
fatherless!
010:003
And
what
will
ye
do
in
the
day
of
visitation,
and
in
the
desolation
which
shall
come
from
far?
to
whom
will
ye
flee
for
help?
and
where
will
ye
leave
your
glory?
010:004
Without
me
they
shall
bow
down
under
the
prisoners,
and
they
shall
fall
under
the
slain.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away,
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still.
010:005
O
Assyrian,
the
rod
of
mine
anger,
and
the
staff
in
their
hand
is
mine
indignation.
010:006
I
will
send
him
against
an
hypocritical
nation,
and
against
the
people
of
my
wrath
will
I
give
him
a
charge,
to
take
the
spoil,
and
to
take
the
prey,
and
to
tread
them
down
like
the
mire
of
the
streets.
010:007
Howbeit
he
meaneth
not
so,
neither
doth
his
heart
think
so;
but
it
is
in
his
heart
to
destroy
and
cut
off
nations
not
a
few.
010:008
For
he
saith,
Are
not
my
princes
altogether
kings?
010:009
Is
not
Calno
as
Carchemish?
is
not
Hamath
as
Arpad?
is
not
Samaria
as
Damascus?
010:010
As
my
hand
hath
found
the
kingdoms
of
the
idols,
and
whose
graven
images
did
excel
them
of
Jerusalem
and
of
Samaria;
010:011
Shall
I
not,
as
I
have
done
unto
Samaria
and
her
idols,
so
do
to
Jerusalem
and
her
idols?
010:012
Wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
when
the
Lord
hath
performed
his
whole
work
upon
mount
Zion
and
on
Jerusalem,
I
will
punish
the
fruit
of
the
stout
heart
of
the
king
of
Assyria,
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks.
010:013
For
he
saith,
By
the
strength
of
my
hand
I
have
done
it,
and
by
my
wisdom;
for
I
am
prudent:
and
I
have
removed
the
bounds
of
the
people,
and
have
robbed
their
treasures,
and
I
have
put
down
the
inhabitants
like
a
valiant
man:
010:014
And
my
hand
hath
found
as
a
nest
the
riches
of
the
people:
and
as
one
gathereth
eggs
that
are
left,
have
I
gathered
all
the
earth;
and
there
was
none
that
moved
the
wing,
or
opened
the
mouth,
or
peeped.
010:015
Shall
the
axe
boast
itself
against
him
that
heweth
therewith?
or
shall
the
saw
magnify
itself
against
him
that
shaketh
it?
as
if
the
rod
should
shake
itself
against
them
that
lift
it
up,
or
as
if
the
staff
should
lift
up
itself,
as
if
it
were
no
wood.
010:016
Therefore
shall
the
Lord,
the
Lord
of
hosts,
send
among
his
fat
ones
leanness;
and
under
his
glory
he
shall
kindle
a
burning
like
the
burning
of
a
fire.
010:017
And
the
light
of
Israel
shall
be
for
a
fire,
and
his
Holy
One
for
a
flame:
and
it
shall
burn
and
devour
his
thorns
and
his
briers
in
one
day;
010:018
And
shall
consume
the
glory
of
his
forest,
and
of
his
fruitful
field,
both
soul
and
body:
and
they
shall
be
as
when
a
standard-bearer
fainteth.
010:019
And
the
rest
of
the
trees
of
his
forest
shall
be
few,
that
a
child
may
write
them.
010:020
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
the
remnant
of
Israel,
and
such
as
are
escaped
of
the
house
of
Jacob,
shall
no
more
again
stay
upon
him
that
smote
them;
but
shall
stay
upon
the
LORD,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel,
in
truth.
010:021
The
remnant
shall
return,
even
the
remnant
of
Jacob,
unto
the
mighty
God.
010:022
For
though
thy
people
Israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea,
yet
a
remnant
of
them
shall
return:
the
consumption
decreed
shall
overflow
with
righteousness.
010:023
For
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts
shall
make
a
consumption,
even
determined,
in
the
midst
of
all
the
land.
010:024
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts,
O
my
people
that
dwellest
in
Zion,
be
not
afraid
of
the
Assyrian:
he
shall
smite
thee
with
a
rod,
and
shall
lift
up
his
staff
against
thee,
after
the
manner
of
Egypt.
010:025
For
yet
a
very
little
while,
and
the
indignation
shall
cease,
and
mine
anger
in
their
destruction.
010:026
And
the
LORD
of
hosts
shall
stir
up
a
scourge
for
him
according
to
the
slaughter
of
Midian
at
the
rock
of
Oreb:
and
as
his
rod
was
upon
the
sea,
so
shall
he
lift
it
up
after
the
manner
of
Egypt.
010:027
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
his
burden
shall
be
taken
away
from
off
thy
shoulder,
and
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck,
and
the
yoke
shall
be
destroyed
because
of
the
anointing.
010:028
He
is
come
to
Aiath,
he
is
passed
to
Migron;
at
Michmash
he
hath
laid
up
his
carriages:
010:029
They
are
gone
over
the
passage:
they
have
taken
up
their
lodging
at
Geba;
Ramah
is
afraid;
Gibeah
of
Saul
is
fled.
010:030
Lift
up
thy
voice,
O
daughter
of
Gallim:
cause
it
to
be
heard
unto
Laish,
O
poor
Anathoth.
010:031
Madmenah
is
removed;
the
inhabitants
of
Gebim
gather
themselves
to
flee.
010:032
As
yet
shall
he
remain
at
Nob
that
day:
he
shall
shake
his
hand
against
the
mount
of
the
daughter
of
Zion,
the
hill
of
Jerusalem.
010:033
Behold,
the
Lord,
the
LORD
of
hosts,
shall
lop
the
bough
with
terror:
and
the
high
ones
of
stature
shall
be
hewn
down,
and
the
haughty
shall
be
humbled.
010:034
And
he
shall
cut
down
the
thickets
of
the
forest
with
iron,
and
Lebanon
shall
fall
by
a
mighty
one.
011:001
And
there
shall
come
forth
a
rod
out
of
the
stem
of
Jesse,
and
a
Branch
shall
grow
out
of
his
roots:
011:002
And
the
spirit
of
the
LORD
shall
rest
upon
him,
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding,
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
might,
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
the
LORD;
011:003
And
shall
make
him
of
quick
understanding
in
the
fear
of
the
LORD:
and
he
shall
not
judge
after
the
sight
of
his
eyes,
neither
reprove
after
the
hearing
of
his
ears:
011:004
But
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge
the
poor,
and
reprove
with
equity
for
the
meek
of
the
earth:
and
he
shall
smite
the
earth:
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth,
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked.
011:005
And
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins,
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins.
011:006
The
wolf
also
shall
dwell
with
the
lamb,
and
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid;
and
the
calf
and
the
young
lion
and
the
fatling
together;
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them.
011:007
And
the
cow
and
the
bear
shall
feed;
their
young
ones
shall
lie
down
together:
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
ox.
011:008
And
the
sucking
child
shall
play
on
the
hole
of
the
asp,
and
the
weaned
child
shall
put
his
hand
on
the
cockatrice'
den.
011:009
They
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain:
for
the
earth
shall
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
LORD,
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea.
011:010
And
in
that
day
there
shall
be
a
root
of
Jesse,
which
shall
stand
for
an
ensign
of
the
people;
to
it
shall
the
Gentiles
seek:
and
his
rest
shall
be
glorious.
011:011
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
the
Lord
shall
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
the
remnant
of
his
people,
which
shall
be
left,
from
Assyria,
and
from
Egypt,
and
from
Pathros,
and
from
Cush,
and
from
Elam,
and
from
Shinar,
and
from
Hamath,
and
from
the
islands
of
the
sea.
011:012
And
he
shall
set
up
an
ensign
for
the
nations,
and
shall
assemble
the
outcasts
of
Israel,
and
gather
together
the
dispersed
of
Judah
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth.
011:013
The
envy
also
of
Ephraim
shall
depart,
and
the
adversaries
of
Judah
shall
be
cut
off:
Ephraim
shall
not
envy
Judah,
and
Judah
shall
not
vex
Ephraim.
011:014
But
they
shall
fly
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
Philistines
toward
the
west;
they
shall
spoil
them
of
the
east
together:
they
shall
lay
their
hand
upon
Edom
and
Moab;
and
the
children
of
Ammon
shall
obey
them.
011:015
And
the
LORD
shall
utterly
destroy
the
tongue
of
the
Egyptian
sea;
and
with
his
mighty
wind
shall
he
shake
his
hand
over
the
river,
and
shall
smite
it
in
the
seven
streams,
and
make
men
go
over
dryshod.
011:016
And
there
shall
be
an
highway
for
the
remnant
of
his
people,
which
shall
be
left,
from
Assyria;
like
as
it
was
to
Israel
in
the
day
that
he
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
012:001
And
in
that
day
thou
shalt
say,
O
LORD,
I
will
praise
thee:
though
thou
wast
angry
with
me,
thine
anger
is
turned
away,
and
thou
comfortedst
me.
012:002
Behold,
God
is
my
salvation;
I
will
trust,
and
not
be
afraid:
for
the
LORD
JEHOVAH
is
my
strength
and
my
song;
he
also
is
become
my
salvation.
012:003
Therefore
with
joy
shall
ye
draw
water
out
of
the
wells
of
salvation.
012:004
And
in
that
day
shall
ye
say,
Praise
the
LORD,
call
upon
his
name,
declare
his
doings
among
the
people,
make
mention
that
his
name
is
exalted.
012:005
Sing
unto
the
LORD;
for
he
hath
done
excellent
things:
this
is
known
in
all
the
earth.
012:006
Cry
out
and
shout,
thou
inhabitant
of
Zion:
for
great
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
in
the
midst
of
thee.
013:001
The
burden
of
Babylon,
which
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
did
see.
013:002
Lift
ye
up
a
banner
upon
the
high
mountain,
exalt
the
voice
unto
them,
shake
the
hand,
that
they
may
go
into
the
gates
of
the
nobles.
013:003
I
have
commanded
my
sanctified
ones,
I
have
also
called
my
mighty
ones
for
mine
anger,
even
them
that
rejoice
in
my
highness.
013:004
The
noise
of
a
multitude
in
the
mountains,
like
as
of
a
great
people;
a
tumultuous
noise
of
the
kingdoms
of
nations
gathered
together:
the
LORD
of
hosts
mustereth
the
host
of
the
battle.
013:005
They
come
from
a
far
country,
from
the
end
of
heaven,
even
the
LORD,
and
the
weapons
of
his
indignation,
to
destroy
the
whole
land.
013:006
Howl
ye;
for
the
day
of
the
LORD
is
at
hand;
it
shall
come
as
a
destruction
from
the
Almighty.
013:007
Therefore
shall
all
hands
be
faint,
and
every
man's
heart
shall
melt:
013:008
And
they
shall
be
afraid:
pangs
and
sorrows
shall
take
hold
of
them;
they
shall
be
in
pain
as
a
woman
that
travaileth:
they
shall
be
amazed
one
at
another;
their
faces
shall
be
as
flames.
013:009
Behold,
the
day
of
the
LORD
cometh,
cruel
both
with
wrath
and
fierce
anger,
to
lay
the
land
desolate:
and
he
shall
destroy
the
sinners
thereof
out
of
it.
013:010
For
the
stars
of
heaven
and
the
constellations
thereof
shall
not
give
their
light:
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
in
his
going
forth,
and
the
moon
shall
not
cause
her
light
to
shine.
013:011
And
I
will
punish
the
world
for
their
evil,
and
the
wicked
for
their
iniquity;
and
I
will
cause
the
arrogancy
of
the
proud
to
cease,
and
will
lay
low
the
haughtiness
of
the
terrible.
013:012
I
will
make
a
man
more
precious
than
fine
gold;
even
a
man
than
the
golden
wedge
of
Ophir.
013:013
Therefore
I
will
shake
the
heavens,
and
the
earth
shall
remove
out
of
her
place,
in
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
in
the
day
of
his
fierce
anger.
013:014
And
it
shall
be
as
the
chased
roe,
and
as
a
sheep
that
no
man
taketh
up:
they
shall
every
man
turn
to
his
own
people,
and
flee
every
one
into
his
own
land.
013:015
Every
one
that
is
found
shall
be
thrust
through;
and
every
one
that
is
joined
unto
them
shall
fall
by
the
sword.
013:016
Their
children
also
shall
be
dashed
to
pieces
before
their
eyes;
their
houses
shall
be
spoiled,
and
their
wives
ravished.
013:017
Behold,
I
will
stir
up
the
Medes
against
them,
which
shall
not
regard
silver;
and
as
for
gold,
they
shall
not
delight
in
it.
013:018
Their
bows
also
shall
dash
the
young
men
to
pieces;
and
they
shall
have
no
pity
on
the
fruit
of
the
womb;
their
eyes
shall
not
spare
children.
013:019
And
Babylon,
the
glory
of
kingdoms,
the
beauty
of
the
Chaldees'
excellency,
shall
be
as
when
God
overthrew
Sodom
and
Gomorrah.
013:020
It
shall
never
be
inhabited,
neither
shall
it
be
dwelt
in
from
generation
to
generation:
neither
shall
the
Arabian
pitch
tent
there;
neither
shall
the
shepherds
make
their
fold
there.
013:021
But
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
shall
lie
there;
and
their
houses
shall
be
full
of
doleful
creatures;
and
owls
shall
dwell
there,
and
satyrs
shall
dance
there.
013:022
And
the
wild
beasts
of
the
islands
shall
cry
in
their
desolate
houses,
and
dragons
in
their
pleasant
palaces:
and
her
time
is
near
to
come,
and
her
days
shall
not
be
prolonged.
014:001
For
the
LORD
will
have
mercy
on
Jacob,
and
will
yet
choose
Israel,
and
set
them
in
their
own
land:
and
the
strangers
shall
be
joined
with
them,
and
they
shall
cleave
to
the
house
of
Jacob.
014:002
And
the
people
shall
take
them,
and
bring
them
to
their
place:
and
the
house
of
Israel
shall
possess
them
in
the
land
of
the
LORD
for
servants
and
handmaids:
and
they
shall
take
them
captives,
whose
captives
they
were;
and
they
shall
rule
over
their
oppressors.
014:003
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
day
that
the
LORD
shall
give
thee
rest
from
thy
sorrow,
and
from
thy
fear,
and
from
the
hard
bondage
wherein
thou
wast
made
to
serve,
014:004
That
thou
shalt
take
up
this
proverb
against
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
say,
How
hath
the
oppressor
ceased!
the
golden
city
ceased!
014:005
The
LORD
hath
broken
the
staff
of
the
wicked,
and
the
sceptre
of
the
rulers.
014:006
He
who
smote
the
people
in
wrath
with
a
continual
stroke,
he
that
ruled
the
nations
in
anger,
is
persecuted,
and
none
hindereth.
014:007
The
whole
earth
is
at
rest,
and
is
quiet:
they
break
forth
into
singing.
014:008
Yea,
the
fir
trees
rejoice
at
thee,
and
the
cedars
of
Lebanon,
saying,
Since
thou
art
laid
down,
no
feller
is
come
up
against
us.
014:009
Hell
from
beneath
is
moved
for
thee
to
meet
thee
at
thy
coming:
it
stirreth
up
the
dead
for
thee,
even
all
the
chief
ones
of
the
earth;
it
hath
raised
up
from
their
thrones
all
the
kings
of
the
nations.
014:010
All
they
shall
speak
and
say
unto
thee,
Art
thou
also
become
weak
as
we?
art
thou
become
like
unto
us?
014:011
Thy
pomp
is
brought
down
to
the
grave,
and
the
noise
of
thy
viols:
the
worm
is
spread
under
thee,
and
the
worms
cover
thee.
014:012
How
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven,
O
Lucifer,
son
of
the
morning!
how
art
thou
cut
down
to
the
ground,
which
didst
weaken
the
nations!
014:013
For
thou
hast
said
in
thine
heart,
I
will
ascend
into
heaven,
I
will
exalt
my
throne
above
the
stars
of
God:
I
will
sit
also
upon
the
mount
of
the
congregation,
in
the
sides
of
the
north:
014:014
I
will
ascend
above
the
heights
of
the
clouds;
I
will
be
like
the
most
High.
014:015
Yet
thou
shalt
be
brought
down
to
hell,
to
the
sides
of
the
pit.
014:016
They
that
see
thee
shall
narrowly
look
upon
thee,
and
consider
thee,
saying,
Is
this
the
man
that
made
the
earth
to
tremble,
that
did
shake
kingdoms;
014:017
That
made
the
world
as
a
wilderness,
and
destroyed
the
cities
thereof;
that
opened
not
the
house
of
his
prisoners?
014:018
All
the
kings
of
the
nations,
even
all
of
them,
lie
in
glory,
every
one
in
his
own
house.
014:019
But
thou
art
cast
out
of
thy
grave
like
an
abominable
branch,
and
as
the
raiment
of
those
that
are
slain,
thrust
through
with
a
sword,
that
go
down
to
the
stones
of
the
pit;
as
a
carcase
trodden
under
feet.
014:020
Thou
shalt
not
be
joined
with
them
in
burial,
because
thou
hast
destroyed
thy
land,
and
slain
thy
people:
the
seed
of
evildoers
shall
never
be
renowned.
014:021
Prepare
slaughter
for
his
children
for
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers;
that
they
do
not
rise,
nor
possess
the
land,
nor
fill
the
face
of
the
world
with
cities.
014:022
For
I
will
rise
up
against
them,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
cut
off
from
Babylon
the
name,
and
remnant,
and
son,
and
nephew,
saith
the
LORD.
014:023
I
will
also
make
it
a
possession
for
the
bittern,
and
pools
of
water:
and
I
will
sweep
it
with
the
besom
of
destruction,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
014:024
The
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sworn,
saying,
Surely
as
