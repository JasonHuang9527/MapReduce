I
have
thought,
so
shall
it
come
to
pass;
and
as
I
have
purposed,
so
shall
it
stand:
014:025
That
I
will
break
the
Assyrian
in
my
land,
and
upon
my
mountains
tread
him
under
foot:
then
shall
his
yoke
depart
from
off
them,
and
his
burden
depart
from
off
their
shoulders.
014:026
This
is
the
purpose
that
is
purposed
upon
the
whole
earth:
and
this
is
the
hand
that
is
stretched
out
upon
all
the
nations.
014:027
For
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
purposed,
and
who
shall
disannul
it?
and
his
hand
is
stretched
out,
and
who
shall
turn
it
back?
014:028
In
the
year
that
king
Ahaz
died
was
this
burden.
014:029
Rejoice
not
thou,
whole
Palestina,
because
the
rod
of
him
that
smote
thee
is
broken:
for
out
of
the
serpent's
root
shall
come
forth
a
cockatrice,
and
his
fruit
shall
be
a
fiery
flying
serpent.
014:030
And
the
firstborn
of
the
poor
shall
feed,
and
the
needy
shall
lie
down
in
safety:
and
I
will
kill
thy
root
with
famine,
and
he
shall
slay
thy
remnant.
014:031
Howl,
O
gate;
cry,
O
city;
thou,
whole
Palestina,
art
dissolved:
for
there
shall
come
from
the
north
a
smoke,
and
none
shall
be
alone
in
his
appointed
times.
014:032
What
shall
one
then
answer
the
messengers
of
the
nation?
That
the
LORD
hath
founded
Zion,
and
the
poor
of
his
people
shall
trust
in
it.
015:001
The
burden
of
Moab.
Because
in
the
night
Ar
of
Moab
is
laid
waste,
and
brought
to
silence;
because
in
the
night
Kir
of
Moab
is
laid
waste,
and
brought
to
silence;
015:002
He
is
gone
up
to
Bajith,
and
to
Dibon,
the
high
places,
to
weep:
Moab
shall
howl
over
Nebo,
and
over
Medeba:
on
all
their
heads
shall
be
baldness,
and
every
beard
cut
off.
015:003
In
their
streets
they
shall
gird
themselves
with
sackcloth:
on
the
tops
of
their
houses,
and
in
their
streets,
every
one
shall
howl,
weeping
abundantly.
015:004
And
Heshbon
shall
cry,
and
Elealeh:
their
voice
shall
be
heard
even
unto
Jahaz:
therefore
the
armed
soldiers
of
Moab
shall
cry
out;
his
life
shall
be
grievous
unto
him.
015:005
My
heart
shall
cry
out
for
Moab;
his
fugitives
shall
flee
unto
Zoar,
an
heifer
of
three
years
old:
for
by
the
mounting
up
of
Luhith
with
weeping
shall
they
go
it
up;
for
in
the
way
of
Horonaim
they
shall
raise
up
a
cry
of
destruction.
015:006
For
the
waters
of
Nimrim
shall
be
desolate:
for
the
hay
is
withered
away,
the
grass
faileth,
there
is
no
green
thing.
015:007
Therefore
the
abundance
they
have
gotten,
and
that
which
they
have
laid
up,
shall
they
carry
away
to
the
brook
of
the
willows.
015:008
For
the
cry
is
gone
round
about
the
borders
of
Moab;
the
howling
thereof
unto
Eglaim,
and
the
howling
thereof
unto
Beerelim.
015:009
For
the
waters
of
Dimon
shall
be
full
of
blood:
for
I
will
bring
more
upon
Dimon,
lions
upon
him
that
escapeth
of
Moab,
and
upon
the
remnant
of
the
land.
016:001
Send
ye
the
lamb
to
the
ruler
of
the
land
from
Sela
to
the
wilderness,
unto
the
mount
of
the
daughter
of
Zion.
016:002
For
it
shall
be,
that,
as
a
wandering
bird
cast
out
of
the
nest,
so
the
daughters
of
Moab
shall
be
at
the
fords
of
Arnon.
016:003
Take
counsel,
execute
judgment;
make
thy
shadow
as
the
night
in
the
midst
of
the
noonday;
hide
the
outcasts;
bewray
not
him
that
wandereth.
016:004
Let
mine
outcasts
dwell
with
thee,
Moab;
be
thou
a
covert
to
them
from
the
face
of
the
spoiler:
for
the
extortioner
is
at
an
end,
the
spoiler
ceaseth,
the
oppressors
are
consumed
out
of
the
land.
016:005
And
in
mercy
shall
the
throne
be
established:
and
he
shall
sit
upon
it
in
truth
in
the
tabernacle
of
David,
judging,
and
seeking
judgment,
and
hasting
righteousness.
016:006
We
have
heard
of
the
pride
of
Moab;
he
is
very
proud:
even
of
his
haughtiness,
and
his
pride,
and
his
wrath:
but
his
lies
shall
not
be
so.
016:007
Therefore
shall
Moab
howl
for
Moab,
every
one
shall
howl:
for
the
foundations
of
Kirhareseth
shall
ye
mourn;
surely
they
are
stricken.
016:008
For
the
fields
of
Heshbon
languish,
and
the
vine
of
Sibmah:
the
lords
of
the
heathen
have
broken
down
the
principal
plants
thereof,
they
are
come
even
unto
Jazer,
they
wandered
through
the
wilderness:
her
branches
are
stretched
out,
they
are
gone
over
the
sea.
016:009
Therefore
I
will
bewail
with
the
weeping
of
Jazer
the
vine
of
Sibmah:
I
will
water
thee
with
my
tears,
O
Heshbon,
and
Elealeh:
for
the
shouting
for
thy
summer
fruits
and
for
thy
harvest
is
fallen.
016:010
And
gladness
is
taken
away,
and
joy
out
of
the
plentiful
field;
and
in
the
vineyards
there
shall
be
no
singing,
neither
shall
there
be
shouting:
the
treaders
shall
tread
out
no
wine
in
their
presses;
I
have
made
their
vintage
shouting
to
cease.
016:011
Wherefore
my
bowels
shall
sound
like
an
harp
for
Moab,
and
mine
inward
parts
for
Kirharesh.
016:012
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
it
is
seen
that
Moab
is
weary
on
the
high
place,
that
he
shall
come
to
his
sanctuary
to
pray;
but
he
shall
not
prevail.
016:013
This
is
the
word
that
the
LORD
hath
spoken
concerning
Moab
since
that
time.
016:014
But
now
the
LORD
hath
spoken,
saying,
Within
three
years,
as
the
years
of
an
hireling,
and
the
glory
of
Moab
shall
be
contemned,
with
all
that
great
multitude;
and
the
remnant
shall
be
very
small
and
feeble.
017:001
The
burden
of
Damascus.
Behold,
Damascus
is
taken
away
from
being
a
city,
and
it
shall
be
a
ruinous
heap.
017:002
The
cities
of
Aroer
are
forsaken:
they
shall
be
for
flocks,
which
shall
lie
down,
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid.
017:003
The
fortress
also
shall
cease
from
Ephraim,
and
the
kingdom
from
Damascus,
and
the
remnant
of
Syria:
they
shall
be
as
the
glory
of
the
children
of
Israel,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
017:004
And
in
that
day
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
the
glory
of
Jacob
shall
be
made
thin,
and
the
fatness
of
his
flesh
shall
wax
lean.
017:005
And
it
shall
be
as
when
the
harvestman
gathereth
the
corn,
and
reapeth
the
ears
with
his
arm;
and
it
shall
be
as
he
that
gathereth
ears
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
017:006
Yet
gleaning
grapes
shall
be
left
in
it,
as
the
shaking
of
an
olive
tree,
two
or
three
berries
in
the
top
of
the
uppermost
bough,
four
or
five
in
the
outmost
fruitful
branches
thereof,
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
017:007
At
that
day
shall
a
man
look
to
his
Maker,
and
his
eyes
shall
have
respect
to
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
017:008
And
he
shall
not
look
to
the
altars,
the
work
of
his
hands,
neither
shall
respect
that
which
his
fingers
have
made,
either
the
groves,
or
the
images.
017:009
In
that
day
shall
his
strong
cities
be
as
a
forsaken
bough,
and
an
uppermost
branch,
which
they
left
because
of
the
children
of
Israel:
and
there
shall
be
desolation.
017:010
Because
thou
hast
forgotten
the
God
of
thy
salvation,
and
hast
not
been
mindful
of
the
rock
of
thy
strength,
therefore
shalt
thou
plant
pleasant
plants,
and
shalt
set
it
with
strange
slips:
017:011
In
the
day
shalt
thou
make
thy
plant
to
grow,
and
in
the
morning
shalt
thou
make
thy
seed
to
flourish:
but
the
harvest
shall
be
a
heap
in
the
day
of
grief
and
of
desperate
sorrow.
017:012
Woe
to
the
multitude
of
many
people,
which
make
a
noise
like
the
noise
of
the
seas;
and
to
the
rushing
of
nations,
that
make
a
rushing
like
the
rushing
of
mighty
waters!
017:013
The
nations
shall
rush
like
the
rushing
of
many
waters:
but
God
shall
rebuke
them,
and
they
shall
flee
far
off,
and
shall
be
chased
as
the
chaff
of
the
mountains
before
the
wind,
and
like
a
rolling
thing
before
the
whirlwind.
017:014
And
behold
at
eveningtide
trouble;
and
before
the
morning
he
is
not.
This
is
the
portion
of
them
that
spoil
us,
and
the
lot
of
them
that
rob
us.
018:001
Woe
to
the
land
shadowing
with
wings,
which
is
beyond
the
rivers
of
Ethiopia:
018:002
That
sendeth
ambassadors
by
the
sea,
even
in
vessels
of
bulrushes
upon
the
waters,
saying,
Go,
ye
swift
messengers,
to
a
nation
scattered
and
peeled,
to
a
people
terrible
from
their
beginning
hitherto;
a
nation
meted
out
and
trodden
down,
whose
land
the
rivers
have
spoiled!
018:003
All
ye
inhabitants
of
the
world,
and
dwellers
on
the
earth,
see
ye,
when
he
lifteth
up
an
ensign
on
the
mountains;
and
when
he
bloweth
a
trumpet,
hear
ye.
018:004
For
so
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
I
will
take
my
rest,
and
I
will
consider
in
my
dwelling
place
like
a
clear
heat
upon
herbs,
and
like
a
cloud
of
dew
in
the
heat
of
harvest.
018:005
For
afore
the
harvest,
when
the
bud
is
perfect,
and
the
sour
grape
is
ripening
in
the
flower,
he
shall
both
cut
off
the
sprigs
with
pruning
hooks,
and
take
away
and
cut
down
the
branches.
018:006
They
shall
be
left
together
unto
the
fowls
of
the
mountains,
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
earth:
and
the
fowls
shall
summer
upon
them,
and
all
the
beasts
of
the
earth
shall
winter
upon
them.
018:007
In
that
time
shall
the
present
be
brought
unto
the
LORD
of
hosts
of
a
people
scattered
and
peeled,
and
from
a
people
terrible
from
their
beginning
hitherto;
a
nation
meted
out
and
trodden
under
foot,
whose
land
the
rivers
have
spoiled,
to
the
place
of
the
name
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
mount
Zion.
019:001
The
burden
of
Egypt.
Behold,
the
LORD
rideth
upon
a
swift
cloud,
and
shall
come
into
Egypt:
and
the
idols
of
Egypt
shall
be
moved
at
his
presence,
and
the
heart
of
Egypt
shall
melt
in
the
midst
of
it.
019:002
And
I
will
set
the
Egyptians
against
the
Egyptians:
and
they
shall
fight
every
one
against
his
brother,
and
every
one
against
his
neighbour;
city
against
city,
and
kingdom
against
kingdom.
019:003
And
the
spirit
of
Egypt
shall
fail
in
the
midst
thereof;
and
I
will
destroy
the
counsel
thereof:
and
they
shall
seek
to
the
idols,
and
to
the
charmers,
and
to
them
that
have
familiar
spirits,
and
to
the
wizards.
019:004
And
the
Egyptians
will
I
give
over
into
the
hand
of
a
cruel
lord;
and
a
fierce
king
shall
rule
over
them,
saith
the
Lord,
the
LORD
of
hosts.
019:005
And
the
waters
shall
fail
from
the
sea,
and
the
river
shall
be
wasted
and
dried
up.
019:006
And
they
shall
turn
the
rivers
far
away;
and
the
brooks
of
defence
shall
be
emptied
and
dried
up:
the
reeds
and
flags
shall
wither.
019:007
The
paper
reeds
by
the
brooks,
by
the
mouth
of
the
brooks,
and
every
thing
sown
by
the
brooks,
shall
wither,
be
driven
away,
and
be
no
more.
019:008
The
fishers
also
shall
mourn,
and
all
they
that
cast
angle
into
the
brooks
shall
lament,
and
they
that
spread
nets
upon
the
waters
shall
languish.
019:009
Moreover
they
that
work
in
fine
flax,
and
they
that
weave
networks,
shall
be
confounded.
019:010
And
they
shall
be
broken
in
the
purposes
thereof,
all
that
make
sluices
and
ponds
for
fish.
019:011
Surely
the
princes
of
Zoan
are
fools,
the
counsel
of
the
wise
counsellors
of
Pharaoh
is
become
brutish:
how
say
ye
unto
Pharaoh,
I
am
the
son
of
the
wise,
the
son
of
ancient
kings?
019:012
Where
are
they?
where
are
thy
wise
men?
and
let
them
tell
thee
now,
and
let
them
know
what
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
purposed
upon
Egypt.
019:013
The
princes
of
Zoan
are
become
fools,
the
princes
of
Noph
are
deceived;
they
have
also
seduced
Egypt,
even
they
that
are
the
stay
of
the
tribes
thereof.
019:014
The
LORD
hath
mingled
a
perverse
spirit
in
the
midst
thereof:
and
they
have
caused
Egypt
to
err
in
every
work
thereof,
as
a
drunken
man
staggereth
in
his
vomit.
019:015
Neither
shall
there
be
any
work
for
Egypt,
which
the
head
or
tail,
branch
or
rush,
may
do.
019:016
In
that
day
shall
Egypt
be
like
unto
women:
and
it
shall
be
afraid
and
fear
because
of
the
shaking
of
the
hand
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
which
he
shaketh
over
it.
019:017
And
the
land
of
Judah
shall
be
a
terror
unto
Egypt,
every
one
that
maketh
mention
thereof
shall
be
afraid
in
himself,
because
of
the
counsel
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
which
he
hath
determined
against
it.
019:018
In
that
day
shall
five
cities
in
the
land
of
Egypt
speak
the
language
of
Canaan,
and
swear
to
the
LORD
of
hosts;
one
shall
be
called,
The
city
of
destruction.
019:019
In
that
day
shall
there
be
an
altar
to
the
LORD
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
a
pillar
at
the
border
thereof
to
the
LORD.
019:020
And
it
shall
be
for
a
sign
and
for
a
witness
unto
the
LORD
of
hosts
in
the
land
of
Egypt:
for
they
shall
cry
unto
the
LORD
because
of
the
oppressors,
and
he
shall
send
them
a
saviour,
and
a
great
one,
and
he
shall
deliver
them.
019:021
And
the
LORD
shall
be
known
to
Egypt,
and
the
Egyptians
shall
know
the
LORD
in
that
day,
and
shall
do
sacrifice
and
oblation;
yea,
they
shall
vow
a
vow
unto
the
LORD,
and
perform
it.
019:022
And
the
LORD
shall
smite
Egypt:
he
shall
smite
and
heal
it:
and
they
shall
return
even
to
the
LORD,
and
he
shall
be
intreated
of
them,
and
shall
heal
them.
019:023
In
that
day
shall
there
be
a
highway
out
of
Egypt
to
Assyria,
and
the
Assyrian
shall
come
into
Egypt,
and
the
Egyptian
into
Assyria,
and
the
Egyptians
shall
serve
with
the
Assyrians.
019:024
In
that
day
shall
Israel
be
the
third
with
Egypt
and
with
Assyria,
even
a
blessing
in
the
midst
of
the
land:
019:025
Whom
the
LORD
of
hosts
shall
bless,
saying,
Blessed
be
Egypt
my
people,
and
Assyria
the
work
of
my
hands,
and
Israel
mine
inheritance.
020:001
In
the
year
that
Tartan
came
unto
Ashdod,
(when
Sargon
the
king
of
Assyria
sent
him,)
and
fought
against
Ashdod,
and
took
it;
020:002
At
the
same
time
spake
the
LORD
by
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz,
saying,
Go
and
loose
the
sackcloth
from
off
thy
loins,
and
put
off
thy
shoe
from
thy
foot.
And
he
did
so,
walking
naked
and
barefoot.
020:003
And
the
LORD
said,
Like
as
my
servant
Isaiah
hath
walked
naked
and
barefoot
three
years
for
a
sign
and
wonder
upon
Egypt
and
upon
Ethiopia;
020:004
So
shall
the
king
of
Assyria
lead
away
the
Egyptians
prisoners,
and
the
Ethiopians
captives,
young
and
old,
naked
and
barefoot,
even
with
their
buttocks
uncovered,
to
the
shame
of
Egypt.
020:005
And
they
shall
be
afraid
and
ashamed
of
Ethiopia
their
expectation,
and
of
Egypt
their
glory.
020:006
And
the
inhabitant
of
this
isle
shall
say
in
that
day,
Behold,
such
is
our
expectation,
whither
we
flee
for
help
to
be
delivered
from
the
king
of
Assyria:
and
how
shall
we
escape?
021:001
The
burden
of
the
desert
of
the
sea.
As
whirlwinds
in
the
south
pass
through;
so
it
cometh
from
the
desert,
from
a
terrible
land.
021:002
A
grievous
vision
is
declared
unto
me;
the
treacherous
dealer
dealeth
treacherously,
and
the
spoiler
spoileth.
Go
up,
O
Elam:
besiege,
O
Media;
all
the
sighing
thereof
have
I
made
to
cease.
021:003
Therefore
are
my
loins
filled
with
pain:
pangs
have
taken
hold
upon
me,
as
the
pangs
of
a
woman
that
travaileth:
I
was
bowed
down
at
the
hearing
of
it;
I
was
dismayed
at
the
seeing
of
it.
021:004
My
heart
panted,
fearfulness
affrighted
me:
the
night
of
my
pleasure
hath
he
turned
into
fear
unto
me.
021:005
Prepare
the
table,
watch
in
the
watchtower,
eat,
drink:
arise,
ye
princes,
and
anoint
the
shield.
021:006
For
thus
hath
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Go,
set
a
watchman,
let
him
declare
what
he
seeth.
021:007
And
he
saw
a
chariot
with
a
couple
of
horsemen,
a
chariot
of
asses,
and
a
chariot
of
camels;
and
he
hearkened
diligently
with
much
heed:
021:008
And
he
cried,
A
lion:
My
lord,
I
stand
continually
upon
the
watchtower
in
the
daytime,
and
I
am
set
in
my
ward
whole
nights:
021:009
And,
behold,
here
cometh
a
chariot
of
men,
with
a
couple
of
horsemen.
And
he
answered
and
said,
Babylon
is
fallen,
is
fallen;
and
all
the
graven
images
of
her
gods
he
hath
broken
unto
the
ground.
021:010
O
my
threshing,
and
the
corn
of
my
floor:
that
which
I
have
heard
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
have
I
declared
unto
you.
021:011
The
burden
of
Dumah.
He
calleth
to
me
out
of
Seir,
Watchman,
what
of
the
night?
Watchman,
what
of
the
night?
021:012
The
watchman
said,
The
morning
cometh,
and
also
the
night:
if
ye
will
enquire,
enquire
ye:
return,
come.
021:013
The
burden
upon
Arabia.
In
the
forest
in
Arabia
shall
ye
lodge,
O
ye
travelling
companies
of
Dedanim.
021:014
The
inhabitants
of
the
land
of
Tema
brought
water
to
him
that
was
thirsty,
they
prevented
with
their
bread
him
that
fled.
021:015
For
they
fled
from
the
swords,
from
the
drawn
sword,
and
from
the
bent
bow,
and
from
the
grievousness
of
war.
021:016
For
thus
hath
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Within
a
year,
according
to
the
years
of
an
hireling,
and
all
the
glory
of
Kedar
shall
fail:
021:017
And
the
residue
of
the
number
of
archers,
the
mighty
men
of
the
children
of
Kedar,
shall
be
diminished:
for
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
hath
spoken
it.
022:001
The
burden
of
the
valley
of
vision.
What
aileth
thee
now,
that
thou
art
wholly
gone
up
to
the
housetops?
022:002
Thou
that
art
full
of
stirs,
a
tumultuous
city,
joyous
city:
thy
slain
men
are
not
slain
with
the
sword,
nor
dead
in
battle.
022:003
All
thy
rulers
are
fled
together,
they
are
bound
by
the
archers:
all
that
are
found
in
thee
are
bound
together,
which
have
fled
from
far.
022:004
Therefore
said
I,
Look
away
from
me;
I
will
weep
bitterly,
labour
not
to
comfort
me,
because
of
the
spoiling
of
the
daughter
of
my
people.
022:005
For
it
is
a
day
of
trouble,
and
of
treading
down,
and
of
perplexity
by
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts
in
the
valley
of
vision,
breaking
down
the
walls,
and
of
crying
to
the
mountains.
022:006
And
Elam
bare
the
quiver
with
chariots
of
men
and
horsemen,
and
Kir
uncovered
the
shield.
022:007
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
thy
choicest
valleys
shall
be
full
of
chariots,
and
the
horsemen
shall
set
themselves
in
array
at
the
gate.
022:008
And
he
discovered
the
covering
of
Judah,
and
thou
didst
look
in
that
day
to
the
armour
of
the
house
of
the
forest.
022:009
Ye
have
seen
also
the
breaches
of
the
city
of
David,
that
they
are
many:
and
ye
gathered
together
the
waters
of
the
lower
pool.
022:010
And
ye
have
numbered
the
houses
of
Jerusalem,
and
the
houses
have
ye
broken
down
to
fortify
the
wall.
022:011
Ye
made
also
a
ditch
between
the
two
walls
for
the
water
of
the
old
pool:
but
ye
have
not
looked
unto
the
maker
thereof,
neither
had
respect
unto
him
that
fashioned
it
long
ago.
022:012
And
in
that
day
did
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts
call
to
weeping,
and
to
mourning,
and
to
baldness,
and
to
girding
with
sackcloth:
022:013
And
behold
joy
and
gladness,
slaying
oxen,
and
killing
sheep,
eating
flesh,
and
drinking
wine:
let
us
eat
and
drink;
for
to
morrow
we
shall
die.
022:014
And
it
was
revealed
in
mine
ears
by
the
LORD
of
hosts,
Surely
this
iniquity
shall
not
be
purged
from
you
till
ye
die,
saith
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts.
022:015
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts,
Go,
get
thee
unto
this
treasurer,
even
unto
Shebna,
which
is
over
the
house,
and
say,
022:016
What
hast
thou
here?
and
whom
hast
thou
here,
that
thou
hast
hewed
thee
out
a
sepulchre
here,
as
he
that
heweth
him
out
a
sepulchre
on
high,
and
that
graveth
an
habitation
for
himself
in
a
rock?
022:017
Behold,
the
LORD
will
carry
thee
away
with
a
mighty
captivity,
and
will
surely
cover
thee.
022:018
He
will
surely
violently
turn
and
toss
thee
like
a
ball
into
a
large
country:
there
shalt
thou
die,
and
there
the
chariots
of
thy
glory
shall
be
the
shame
of
thy
lord's
house.
022:019
And
I
will
drive
thee
from
thy
station,
and
from
thy
state
shall
he
pull
thee
down.
022:020
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
I
will
call
my
servant
Eliakim
the
son
of
Hilkiah:
022:021
And
I
will
clothe
him
with
thy
robe,
and
strengthen
him
with
thy
girdle,
and
I
will
commit
thy
government
into
his
hand:
and
he
shall
be
a
father
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
and
to
the
house
of
Judah.
022:022
And
the
key
of
the
house
of
David
will
I
lay
upon
his
shoulder;
so
he
shall
open,
and
none
shall
shut;
and
he
shall
shut,
and
none
shall
open.
022:023
And
I
will
fasten
him
as
a
nail
in
a
sure
place;
and
he
shall
be
for
a
glorious
throne
to
his
father's
house.
022:024
And
they
shall
hang
upon
him
all
the
glory
of
his
father's
house,
the
offspring
and
the
issue,
all
vessels
of
small
quantity,
from
the
vessels
of
cups,
even
to
all
the
vessels
of
flagons.
022:025
In
that
day,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
shall
the
nail
that
is
fastened
in
the
sure
place
be
removed,
and
be
cut
down,
and
fall;
and
the
burden
that
was
upon
it
shall
be
cut
off:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken
it.
023:001
The
burden
of
Tyre.
Howl,
ye
ships
of
Tarshish;
for
it
is
laid
waste,
so
that
there
is
no
house,
no
entering
in:
from
the
land
of
Chittim
it
is
revealed
to
them.
023:002
Be
still,
ye
inhabitants
of
the
isle;
thou
whom
the
merchants
of
Zidon,
that
pass
over
the
sea,
have
replenished.
023:003
And
by
great
waters
the
seed
of
Sihor,
the
harvest
of
the
river,
is
her
revenue;
and
she
is
a
mart
of
nations.
023:004
Be
thou
ashamed,
O
Zidon:
for
the
sea
hath
spoken,
even
the
strength
of
the
sea,
saying,
I
travail
not,
nor
bring
forth
children,
neither
do
I
nourish
up
young
men,
nor
bring
up
virgins.
023:005
As
at
the
report
concerning
Egypt,
so
shall
they
be
sorely
pained
at
the
report
of
Tyre.
023:006
Pass
ye
over
to
Tarshish;
howl,
ye
inhabitants
of
the
isle.
023:007
Is
this
your
joyous
city,
whose
antiquity
is
of
ancient
days?
her
own
feet
shall
carry
her
afar
off
to
sojourn.
023:008
Who
hath
taken
this
counsel
against
Tyre,
the
crowning
city,
whose
merchants
are
princes,
whose
traffickers
are
the
honourable
of
the
earth?
023:009
The
LORD
of
hosts
hath
purposed
it,
to
stain
the
pride
of
all
glory,
and
to
bring
into
contempt
all
the
honourable
of
the
earth.
023:010
Pass
through
thy
land
as
a
river,
O
daughter
of
Tarshish:
there
is
no
more
strength.
023:011
He
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
sea,
he
shook
the
kingdoms:
the
LORD
hath
given
a
commandment
against
the
merchant
city,
to
destroy
the
strong
holds
thereof.
023:012
And
he
said,
Thou
shalt
no
more
rejoice,
O
thou
oppressed
virgin,
daughter
of
Zidon:
arise,
pass
over
to
Chittim;
there
also
shalt
thou
have
no
rest.
023:013
Behold
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans;
this
people
was
not,
till
the
Assyrian
founded
it
for
them
that
dwell
in
the
wilderness:
they
set
up
the
towers
thereof,
they
raised
up
the
palaces
thereof;
and
he
brought
it
to
ruin.
023:014
Howl,
ye
ships
of
Tarshish:
for
your
strength
is
laid
waste.
023:015
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
Tyre
shall
be
forgotten
seventy
years,
according
to
the
days
of
one
king:
after
the
end
of
seventy
years
shall
Tyre
sing
as
an
harlot.
023:016
Take
an
harp,
go
about
the
city,
