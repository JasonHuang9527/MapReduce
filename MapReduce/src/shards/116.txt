thou
harlot
that
hast
been
forgotten;
make
sweet
melody,
sing
many
songs,
that
thou
mayest
be
remembered.
023:017
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
after
the
end
of
seventy
years,
that
the
LORD
will
visit
Tyre,
and
she
shall
turn
to
her
hire,
and
shall
commit
fornication
with
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
upon
the
face
of
the
earth.
023:018
And
her
merchandise
and
her
hire
shall
be
holiness
to
the
LORD:
it
shall
not
be
treasured
nor
laid
up;
for
her
merchandise
shall
be
for
them
that
dwell
before
the
LORD,
to
eat
sufficiently,
and
for
durable
clothing.
024:001
Behold,
the
LORD
maketh
the
earth
empty,
and
maketh
it
waste,
and
turneth
it
upside
down,
and
scattereth
abroad
the
inhabitants
thereof.
024:002
And
it
shall
be,
as
with
the
people,
so
with
the
priest;
as
with
the
servant,
so
with
his
master;
as
with
the
maid,
so
with
her
mistress;
as
with
the
buyer,
so
with
the
seller;
as
with
the
lender,
so
with
the
borrower;
as
with
the
taker
of
usury,
so
with
the
giver
of
usury
to
him.
024:003
The
land
shall
be
utterly
emptied,
and
utterly
spoiled:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken
this
word.
024:004
The
earth
mourneth
and
fadeth
away,
the
world
languisheth
and
fadeth
away,
the
haughty
people
of
the
earth
do
languish.
024:005
The
earth
also
is
defiled
under
the
inhabitants
thereof;
because
they
have
transgressed
the
laws,
changed
the
ordinance,
broken
the
everlasting
covenant.
024:006
Therefore
hath
the
curse
devoured
the
earth,
and
they
that
dwell
therein
are
desolate:
therefore
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
burned,
and
few
men
left.
024:007
The
new
wine
mourneth,
the
vine
languisheth,
all
the
merryhearted
do
sigh.
024:008
The
mirth
of
tabrets
ceaseth,
the
noise
of
them
that
rejoice
endeth,
the
joy
of
the
harp
ceaseth.
024:009
They
shall
not
drink
wine
with
a
song;
strong
drink
shall
be
bitter
to
them
that
drink
it.
024:010
The
city
of
confusion
is
broken
down:
every
house
is
shut
up,
that
no
man
may
come
in.
024:011
There
is
a
crying
for
wine
in
the
streets;
all
joy
is
darkened,
the
mirth
of
the
land
is
gone.
024:012
In
the
city
is
left
desolation,
and
the
gate
is
smitten
with
destruction.
024:013
When
thus
it
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
the
land
among
the
people,
there
shall
be
as
the
shaking
of
an
olive
tree,
and
as
the
gleaning
grapes
when
the
vintage
is
done.
024:014
They
shall
lift
up
their
voice,
they
shall
sing
for
the
majesty
of
the
LORD,
they
shall
cry
aloud
from
the
sea.
024:015
Wherefore
glorify
ye
the
LORD
in
the
fires,
even
the
name
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
in
the
isles
of
the
sea.
024:016
From
the
uttermost
part
of
the
earth
have
we
heard
songs,
even
glory
to
the
righteous.
But
I
said,
My
leanness,
my
leanness,
woe
unto
me!
the
treacherous
dealers
have
dealt
treacherously;
yea,
the
treacherous
dealers
have
dealt
very
treacherously.
024:017
Fear,
and
the
pit,
and
the
snare,
are
upon
thee,
O
inhabitant
of
the
earth.
024:018
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
he
who
fleeth
from
the
noise
of
the
fear
shall
fall
into
the
pit;
and
he
that
cometh
up
out
of
the
midst
of
the
pit
shall
be
taken
in
the
snare:
for
the
windows
from
on
high
are
open,
and
the
foundations
of
the
earth
do
shake.
024:019
The
earth
is
utterly
broken
down,
the
earth
is
clean
dissolved,
the
earth
is
moved
exceedingly.
024:020
The
earth
shall
reel
to
and
fro
like
a
drunkard,
and
shall
be
removed
like
a
cottage;
and
the
transgression
thereof
shall
be
heavy
upon
it;
and
it
shall
fall,
and
not
rise
again.
024:021
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
the
LORD
shall
punish
the
host
of
the
high
ones
that
are
on
high,
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
upon
the
earth.
024:022
And
they
shall
be
gathered
together,
as
prisoners
are
gathered
in
the
pit,
and
shall
be
shut
up
in
the
prison,
and
after
many
days
shall
they
be
visited.
024:023
Then
the
moon
shall
be
confounded,
and
the
sun
ashamed,
when
the
LORD
of
hosts
shall
reign
in
mount
Zion,
and
in
Jerusalem,
and
before
his
ancients
gloriously.
025:001
O
Lord,
thou
art
my
God;
I
will
exalt
thee,
I
will
praise
thy
name;
for
thou
hast
done
wonderful
things;
thy
counsels
of
old
are
faithfulness
and
truth.
025:002
For
thou
hast
made
of
a
city
an
heap;
of
a
defenced
city
a
ruin:
a
palace
of
strangers
to
be
no
city;
it
shall
never
be
built.
025:003
Therefore
shall
the
strong
people
glorify
thee,
the
city
of
the
terrible
nations
shall
fear
thee.
025:004
For
thou
hast
been
a
strength
to
the
poor,
a
strength
to
the
needy
in
his
distress,
a
refuge
from
the
storm,
a
shadow
from
the
heat,
when
the
blast
of
the
terrible
ones
is
as
a
storm
against
the
wall.
025:005
Thou
shalt
bring
down
the
noise
of
strangers,
as
the
heat
in
a
dry
place;
even
the
heat
with
the
shadow
of
a
cloud:
the
branch
of
the
terrible
ones
shall
be
brought
low.
025:006
And
in
this
mountain
shall
the
LORD
of
hosts
make
unto
all
people
a
feast
of
fat
things,
a
feast
of
wines
on
the
lees,
of
fat
things
full
of
marrow,
of
wines
on
the
lees
well
refined.
025:007
And
he
will
destroy
in
this
mountain
the
face
of
the
covering
cast
over
all
people,
and
the
vail
that
is
spread
over
all
nations.
025:008
He
will
swallow
up
death
in
victory;
and
the
Lord
GOD
will
wipe
away
tears
from
off
all
faces;
and
the
rebuke
of
his
people
shall
he
take
away
from
off
all
the
earth:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken
it.
025:009
And
it
shall
be
said
in
that
day,
Lo,
this
is
our
God;
we
have
waited
for
him,
and
he
will
save
us:
this
is
the
LORD;
we
have
waited
for
him,
we
will
be
glad
and
rejoice
in
his
salvation.
025:010
For
in
this
mountain
shall
the
hand
of
the
LORD
rest,
and
Moab
shall
be
trodden
down
under
him,
even
as
straw
is
trodden
down
for
the
dunghill.
025:011
And
he
shall
spread
forth
his
hands
in
the
midst
of
them,
as
he
that
swimmeth
spreadeth
forth
his
hands
to
swim:
and
he
shall
bring
down
their
pride
together
with
the
spoils
of
their
hands.
025:012
And
the
fortress
of
the
high
fort
of
thy
walls
shall
he
bring
down,
lay
low,
and
bring
to
the
ground,
even
to
the
dust.
026:001
In
that
day
shall
this
song
be
sung
in
the
land
of
Judah;
We
have
a
strong
city;
salvation
will
God
appoint
for
walls
and
bulwarks.
026:002
Open
ye
the
gates,
that
the
righteous
nation
which
keepeth
the
truth
may
enter
in.
026:003
Thou
wilt
keep
him
in
perfect
peace,
whose
mind
is
stayed
on
thee:
because
he
trusteth
in
thee.
026:004
Trust
ye
in
the
LORD
for
ever:
for
in
the
LORD
JEHOVAH
is
everlasting
strength:
026:005
For
he
bringeth
down
them
that
dwell
on
high;
the
lofty
city,
he
layeth
it
low;
he
layeth
it
low,
even
to
the
ground;
he
bringeth
it
even
to
the
dust.
026:006
The
foot
shall
tread
it
down,
even
the
feet
of
the
poor,
and
the
steps
of
the
needy.
026:007
The
way
of
the
just
is
uprightness:
thou,
most
upright,
dost
weigh
the
path
of
the
just.
026:008
Yea,
in
the
way
of
thy
judgments,
O
LORD,
have
we
waited
for
thee;
the
desire
of
our
soul
is
to
thy
name,
and
to
the
remembrance
of
thee.
026:009
With
my
soul
have
I
desired
thee
in
the
night;
yea,
with
my
spirit
within
me
will
I
seek
thee
early:
for
when
thy
judgments
are
in
the
earth,
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
will
learn
righteousness.
026:010
Let
favour
be
shewed
to
the
wicked,
yet
will
he
not
learn
righteousness:
in
the
land
of
uprightness
will
he
deal
unjustly,
and
will
not
behold
the
majesty
of
the
LORD.
026:011
LORD,
when
thy
hand
is
lifted
up,
they
will
not
see:
but
they
shall
see,
and
be
ashamed
for
their
envy
at
the
people;
yea,
the
fire
of
thine
enemies
shall
devour
them.
026:012
LORD,
thou
wilt
ordain
peace
for
us:
for
thou
also
hast
wrought
all
our
works
in
us.
026:013
O
LORD
our
God,
other
lords
beside
thee
have
had
dominion
over
us:
but
by
thee
only
will
we
make
mention
of
thy
name.
026:014
They
are
dead,
they
shall
not
live;
they
are
deceased,
they
shall
not
rise:
therefore
hast
thou
visited
and
destroyed
them,
and
made
all
their
memory
to
perish.
026:015
Thou
hast
increased
the
nation,
O
LORD,
thou
hast
increased
the
nation:
thou
art
glorified:
thou
hadst
removed
it
far
unto
all
the
ends
of
the
earth.
026:016
LORD,
in
trouble
have
they
visited
thee,
they
poured
out
a
prayer
when
thy
chastening
was
upon
them.
026:017
Like
as
a
woman
with
child,
that
draweth
near
the
time
of
her
delivery,
is
in
pain,
and
crieth
out
in
her
pangs;
so
have
we
been
in
thy
sight,
O
LORD.
026:018
We
have
been
with
child,
we
have
been
in
pain,
we
have
as
it
were
brought
forth
wind;
we
have
not
wrought
any
deliverance
in
the
earth;
neither
have
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
fallen.
026:019
Thy
dead
men
shall
live,
together
with
my
dead
body
shall
they
arise.
Awake
and
sing,
ye
that
dwell
in
dust:
for
thy
dew
is
as
the
dew
of
herbs,
and
the
earth
shall
cast
out
the
dead.
026:020
Come,
my
people,
enter
thou
into
thy
chambers,
and
shut
thy
doors
about
thee:
hide
thyself
as
it
were
for
a
little
moment,
until
the
indignation
be
overpast.
026:021
For,
behold,
the
LORD
cometh
out
of
his
place
to
punish
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
for
their
iniquity:
the
earth
also
shall
disclose
her
blood,
and
shall
no
more
cover
her
slain.
027:001
In
that
day
the
LORD
with
his
sore
and
great
and
strong
sword
shall
punish
leviathan
the
piercing
serpent,
even
leviathan
that
crooked
serpent;
and
he
shall
slay
the
dragon
that
is
in
the
sea.
027:002
In
that
day
sing
ye
unto
her,
A
vineyard
of
red
wine.
027:003
I
the
LORD
do
keep
it;
I
will
water
it
every
moment:
lest
any
hurt
it,
I
will
keep
it
night
and
day.
027:004
Fury
is
not
in
me:
who
would
set
the
briers
and
thorns
against
me
in
battle?
I
would
go
through
them,
I
would
burn
them
together.
027:005
Or
let
him
take
hold
of
my
strength,
that
he
may
make
peace
with
me;
and
he
shall
make
peace
with
me.
027:006
He
shall
cause
them
that
come
of
Jacob
to
take
root:
Israel
shall
blossom
and
bud,
and
fill
the
face
of
the
world
with
fruit.
027:007
Hath
he
smitten
him,
as
he
smote
those
that
smote
him?
or
is
he
slain
according
to
the
slaughter
of
them
that
are
slain
by
him?
027:008
In
measure,
when
it
shooteth
forth,
thou
wilt
debate
with
it:
he
stayeth
his
rough
wind
in
the
day
of
the
east
wind.
027:009
By
this
therefore
shall
the
iniquity
of
Jacob
be
purged;
and
this
is
all
the
fruit
to
take
away
his
sin;
when
he
maketh
all
the
stones
of
the
altar
as
chalkstones
that
are
beaten
in
sunder,
the
groves
and
images
shall
not
stand
up.
027:010
Yet
the
defenced
city
shall
be
desolate,
and
the
habitation
forsaken,
and
left
like
a
wilderness:
there
shall
the
calf
feed,
and
there
shall
he
lie
down,
and
consume
the
branches
thereof.
027:011
When
the
boughs
thereof
are
withered,
they
shall
be
broken
off:
the
women
come,
and
set
them
on
fire:
for
it
is
a
people
of
no
understanding:
therefore
he
that
made
them
will
not
have
mercy
on
them,
and
he
that
formed
them
will
shew
them
no
favour.
027:012
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
the
LORD
shall
beat
off
from
the
channel
of
the
river
unto
the
stream
of
Egypt,
and
ye
shall
be
gathered
one
by
one,
O
ye
children
of
Israel.
027:013
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
the
great
trumpet
shall
be
blown,
and
they
shall
come
which
were
ready
to
perish
in
the
land
of
Assyria,
and
the
outcasts
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
shall
worship
the
LORD
in
the
holy
mount
at
Jerusalem.
028:001
Woe
to
the
crown
of
pride,
to
the
drunkards
of
Ephraim,
whose
glorious
beauty
is
a
fading
flower,
which
are
on
the
head
of
the
fat
valleys
of
them
that
are
overcome
with
wine!
028:002
Behold,
the
Lord
hath
a
mighty
and
strong
one,
which
as
a
tempest
of
hail
and
a
destroying
storm,
as
a
flood
of
mighty
waters
overflowing,
shall
cast
down
to
the
earth
with
the
hand.
028:003
The
crown
of
pride,
the
drunkards
of
Ephraim,
shall
be
trodden
under
feet:
028:004
And
the
glorious
beauty,
which
is
on
the
head
of
the
fat
valley,
shall
be
a
fading
flower,
and
as
the
hasty
fruit
before
the
summer;
which
when
he
that
looketh
upon
it
seeth,
while
it
is
yet
in
his
hand
he
eateth
it
up.
028:005
In
that
day
shall
the
LORD
of
hosts
be
for
a
crown
of
glory,
and
for
a
diadem
of
beauty,
unto
the
residue
of
his
people,
028:006
And
for
a
spirit
of
judgment
to
him
that
sitteth
in
judgment,
and
for
strength
to
them
that
turn
the
battle
to
the
gate.
028:007
But
they
also
have
erred
through
wine,
and
through
strong
drink
are
out
of
the
way;
the
priest
and
the
prophet
have
erred
through
strong
drink,
they
are
swallowed
up
of
wine,
they
are
out
of
the
way
through
strong
drink;
they
err
in
vision,
they
stumble
in
judgment.
028:008
For
all
tables
are
full
of
vomit
and
filthiness,
so
that
there
is
no
place
clean.
028:009
Whom
shall
he
teach
knowledge?
and
whom
shall
he
make
to
understand
doctrine?
them
that
are
weaned
from
the
milk,
and
drawn
from
the
breasts.
028:010
For
precept
must
be
upon
precept,
precept
upon
precept;
line
upon
line,
line
upon
line;
here
a
little,
and
there
a
little:
028:011
For
with
stammering
lips
and
another
tongue
will
he
speak
to
this
people.
028:012
To
whom
he
said,
This
is
the
rest
wherewith
ye
may
cause
the
weary
to
rest;
and
this
is
the
refreshing:
yet
they
would
not
hear.
028:013
But
the
word
of
the
LORD
was
unto
them
precept
upon
precept,
precept
upon
precept;
line
upon
line,
line
upon
line;
here
a
little,
and
there
a
little;
that
they
might
go,
and
fall
backward,
and
be
broken,
and
snared,
and
taken.
028:014
Wherefore
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
ye
scornful
men,
that
rule
this
people
which
is
in
Jerusalem.
028:015
Because
ye
have
said,
We
have
made
a
covenant
with
death,
and
with
hell
are
we
at
agreement;
when
the
overflowing
scourge
shall
pass
through,
it
shall
not
come
unto
us:
for
we
have
made
lies
our
refuge,
and
under
falsehood
have
we
hid
ourselves:
028:016
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
Behold,
I
lay
in
Zion
for
a
foundation
a
stone,
a
tried
stone,
a
precious
corner
stone,
a
sure
foundation:
he
that
believeth
shall
not
make
haste.
028:017
Judgment
also
will
I
lay
to
the
line,
and
righteousness
to
the
plummet:
and
the
hail
shall
sweep
away
the
refuge
of
lies,
and
the
waters
shall
overflow
the
hiding
place.
028:018
And
your
covenant
with
death
shall
be
disannulled,
and
your
agreement
with
hell
shall
not
stand;
when
the
overflowing
scourge
shall
pass
through,
then
ye
shall
be
trodden
down
by
it.
028:019
From
the
time
that
it
goeth
forth
it
shall
take
you:
for
morning
by
morning
shall
it
pass
over,
by
day
and
by
night:
and
it
shall
be
a
vexation
only
to
understand
the
report.
028:020
For
the
bed
is
shorter
than
that
a
man
can
stretch
himself
on
it:
and
the
covering
narrower
than
that
he
can
wrap
himself
in
it.
028:021
For
the
LORD
shall
rise
up
as
in
mount
Perazim,
he
shall
be
wroth
as
in
the
valley
of
Gibeon,
that
he
may
do
his
work,
his
strange
work;
and
bring
to
pass
his
act,
his
strange
act.
028:022
Now
therefore
be
ye
not
mockers,
lest
your
bands
be
made
strong:
for
I
have
heard
from
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts
a
consumption,
even
determined
upon
the
whole
earth.
028:023
Give
ye
ear,
and
hear
my
voice;
hearken,
and
hear
my
speech.
028:024
Doth
the
plowman
plow
all
day
to
sow?
doth
he
open
and
break
the
clods
of
his
ground?
028:025
When
he
hath
made
plain
the
face
thereof,
doth
he
not
cast
abroad
the
fitches,
and
scatter
the
cummin,
and
cast
in
the
principal
wheat
and
the
appointed
barley
and
the
rie
in
their
place?
028:026
For
his
God
doth
instruct
him
to
discretion,
and
doth
teach
him.
028:027
For
the
fitches
are
not
threshed
with
a
threshing
instrument,
neither
is
a
cart
wheel
turned
about
upon
the
cummin;
but
the
fitches
are
beaten
out
with
a
staff,
and
the
cummin
with
a
rod.
028:028
Bread
corn
is
bruised;
because
he
will
not
ever
be
threshing
it,
nor
break
it
with
the
wheel
of
his
cart,
nor
bruise
it
with
his
horsemen.
028:029
This
also
cometh
forth
from
the
LORD
of
hosts,
which
is
wonderful
in
counsel,
and
excellent
in
working.
029:001
Woe
to
Ariel,
to
Ariel,
the
city
where
David
dwelt!
add
ye
year
to
year;
let
them
kill
sacrifices.
029:002
Yet
I
will
distress
Ariel,
and
there
shall
be
heaviness
and
sorrow:
and
it
shall
be
unto
me
as
Ariel.
029:003
And
I
will
camp
against
thee
round
about,
and
will
lay
siege
against
thee
with
a
mount,
and
I
will
raise
forts
against
thee.
029:004
And
thou
shalt
be
brought
down,
and
shalt
speak
out
of
the
ground,
and
thy
speech
shall
be
low
out
of
the
dust,
and
thy
voice
shall
be,
as
of
one
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit,
out
of
the
ground,
and
thy
speech
shall
whisper
out
of
the
dust.
029:005
Moreover
the
multitude
of
thy
strangers
shall
be
like
small
dust,
and
the
multitude
of
the
terrible
ones
shall
be
as
chaff
that
passeth
away:
yea,
it
shall
be
at
an
instant
suddenly.
029:006
Thou
shalt
be
visited
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
with
thunder,
and
with
earthquake,
and
great
noise,
with
storm
and
tempest,
and
the
flame
of
devouring
fire.
029:007
And
the
multitude
of
all
the
nations
that
fight
against
Ariel,
even
all
that
fight
against
her
and
her
munition,
and
that
distress
her,
shall
be
as
a
dream
of
a
night
vision.
029:008
It
shall
even
be
as
when
an
hungry
man
dreameth,
and,
behold,
he
eateth;
but
he
awaketh,
and
his
soul
is
empty:
or
as
when
a
thirsty
man
dreameth,
and,
behold,
he
drinketh;
but
he
awaketh,
and,
behold,
he
is
faint,
and
his
soul
hath
appetite:
so
shall
the
multitude
of
all
the
nations
be,
that
fight
against
mount
Zion.
029:009
Stay
yourselves,
and
wonder;
cry
ye
out,
and
cry:
they
are
drunken,
but
not
with
wine;
they
stagger,
but
not
with
strong
drink.
029:010
For
the
LORD
hath
poured
out
upon
you
the
spirit
of
deep
sleep,
and
hath
closed
your
eyes:
the
prophets
and
your
rulers,
the
seers
hath
he
covered.
029:011
And
the
vision
of
all
is
become
unto
you
as
the
words
of
a
book
that
is
sealed,
which
men
deliver
to
one
that
is
learned,
saying,
Read
this,
I
pray
thee:
and
he
saith,
I
cannot;
for
it
is
sealed:
029:012
And
the
book
is
delivered
to
him
that
is
not
learned,
saying,
Read
this,
I
pray
thee:
and
he
saith,
I
am
not
learned.
029:013
Wherefore
the
Lord
said,
Forasmuch
as
this
people
draw
near
me
with
their
mouth,
and
with
their
lips
do
honour
me,
but
have
removed
their
heart
far
from
me,
and
their
fear
toward
me
is
taught
by
the
precept
of
men:
029:014
Therefore,
behold,
I
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvellous
work
among
this
people,
even
a
marvellous
work
and
a
wonder:
for
the
wisdom
of
their
wise
men
shall
perish,
and
the
understanding
of
their
prudent
men
shall
be
hid.
029:015
Woe
unto
them
that
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsel
from
the
LORD,
and
their
works
are
in
the
dark,
and
they
say,
Who
seeth
us?
and
who
knoweth
us?
029:016
Surely
your
turning
of
things
upside
down
shall
be
esteemed
as
the
potter's
clay:
for
shall
the
work
say
of
him
that
made
it,
He
made
me
not?
or
shall
the
thing
framed
say
of
him
that
framed
it,
He
had
no
understanding?
029:017
Is
it
not
yet
a
very
little
while,
and
Lebanon
shall
be
turned
into
a
fruitful
field,
and
the
fruitful
field
shall
be
esteemed
as
a
forest?
029:018
And
in
that
day
shall
the
deaf
hear
the
words
of
the
book,
and
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
see
out
of
obscurity,
and
out
of
darkness.
029:019
The
meek
also
shall
increase
their
joy
in
the
LORD,
and
the
poor
among
men
shall
rejoice
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
029:020
For
the
terrible
one
is
brought
to
nought,
and
the
scorner
is
consumed,
and
all
that
watch
for
iniquity
are
cut
off:
029:021
That
make
a
man
an
offender
for
a
word,
and
lay
a
snare
for
him
that
reproveth
in
the
gate,
and
turn
aside
the
just
for
a
thing
of
nought.
029:022
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD,
who
redeemed
Abraham,
concerning
the
house
of
Jacob,
Jacob
shall
not
now
be
ashamed,
neither
shall
his
face
now
wax
pale.
029:023
But
when
he
seeth
his
children,
the
work
of
mine
hands,
in
the
midst
of
him,
they
shall
sanctify
my
name,
and
sanctify
the
Holy
One
of
Jacob,
and
shall
fear
the
God
of
Israel.
029:024
They
also
that
erred
in
spirit
shall
come
to
understanding,
and
they
that
murmured
shall
learn
doctrine.
030:001
Woe
to
the
rebellious
children,
saith
the
LORD,
that
take
counsel,
but
not
of
me;
and
that
cover
with
a
covering,
but
not
of
my
spirit,
that
they
may
add
sin
to
sin:
030:002
That
walk
to
go
down
into
Egypt,
and
have
not
asked
at
my
mouth;
to
strengthen
themselves
in
the
strength
of
Pharaoh,
and
to
trust
in
the
shadow
of
Egypt!
030:003
Therefore
shall
the
strength
of
Pharaoh
be
your
shame,
and
the
trust
in
the
shadow
of
Egypt
your
confusion.
030:004
For
his
princes
were
at
Zoan,
and
his
ambassadors
came
to
Hanes.
030:005
They
were
all
ashamed
of
a
people
that
could
not
profit
them,
nor
be
an
help
nor
profit,
but
a
shame,
and
also
a
reproach.
030:006
The
burden
of
the
beasts
of
the
south:
into
the
land
of
trouble
and
anguish,
from
whence
come
the
young
and
old
lion,
the
viper
and
fiery
flying
serpent,
they
will
carry
their
riches
upon
the
shoulders
of
young
asses,
and
their
treasures
upon
the
bunches
of
camels,
to
a
people
that
shall
not
profit
them.
030:007
For
the
Egyptians
shall
help
in
vain,
and
to
no
purpose:
therefore
have
I
cried
concerning
this,
Their
strength
is
to
sit
still.
030:008
Now
go,
write
it
before
them
in
a
table,
and
note
it
in
a
book,
that
it
may
be
for
the
time
to
come
for
ever
and
ever:
030:009
That
this
is
a
rebellious
people,
lying
children,
children
that
will
not
hear
the
law
of
the
LORD:
030:010
Which
say
to
the
seers,
See
not;
and
to
the
prophets,
Prophesy
not
unto
us
right
things,
speak
unto
us
smooth
things,
prophesy
deceits:
030:011
Get
you
out
of
the
way,
turn
aside
out
of
the
path,
cause
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
to
cease
from
before
us.
030:012
Wherefore
thus
saith
the
Holy
One
of
Israel,
Because
ye
despise
this
word,
and
trust
in
oppression
and
perverseness,
and
stay
thereon:
030:013
Therefore
this
iniquity
shall
be
to
you
as
a
breach
ready
to
fall,
swelling
out
in
a
high
wall,
whose
breaking
cometh
suddenly
at
an
instant.
030:014
And
he
shall
break
it
as
the
breaking
of
the
potters'
vessel
that
is
broken
in
pieces;
he
shall
not
spare:
so
that
there
shall
not
be
found
in
the
bursting
of
it
a
sherd
to
take
