fire
from
the
hearth,
or
to
take
water
withal
out
of
the
pit.
030:015
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel;
In
returning
and
rest
shall
ye
be
saved;
in
quietness
and
in
confidence
shall
be
your
strength:
and
ye
would
not.
030:016
But
ye
said,
No;
for
we
will
flee
upon
horses;
therefore
shall
ye
flee:
and,
We
will
ride
upon
the
swift;
therefore
shall
they
that
pursue
you
be
swift.
030:017
One
thousand
shall
flee
at
the
rebuke
of
one;
at
the
rebuke
of
five
shall
ye
flee:
till
ye
be
left
as
a
beacon
upon
the
top
of
a
mountain,
and
as
an
ensign
on
an
hill.
030:018
And
therefore
will
the
LORD
wait,
that
he
may
be
gracious
unto
you,
and
therefore
will
he
be
exalted,
that
he
may
have
mercy
upon
you:
for
the
LORD
is
a
God
of
judgment:
blessed
are
all
they
that
wait
for
him.
030:019
For
the
people
shall
dwell
in
Zion
at
Jerusalem:
thou
shalt
weep
no
more:
he
will
be
very
gracious
unto
thee
at
the
voice
of
thy
cry;
when
he
shall
hear
it,
he
will
answer
thee.
030:020
And
though
the
Lord
give
you
the
bread
of
adversity,
and
the
water
of
affliction,
yet
shall
not
thy
teachers
be
removed
into
a
corner
any
more,
but
thine
eyes
shall
see
thy
teachers:
030:021
And
thine
ears
shall
hear
a
word
behind
thee,
saying,
This
is
the
way,
walk
ye
in
it,
when
ye
turn
to
the
right
hand,
and
when
ye
turn
to
the
left.
030:022
Ye
shall
defile
also
the
covering
of
thy
graven
images
of
silver,
and
the
ornament
of
thy
molten
images
of
gold:
thou
shalt
cast
them
away
as
a
menstruous
cloth;
thou
shalt
say
unto
it,
Get
thee
hence.
030:023
Then
shall
he
give
the
rain
of
thy
seed,
that
thou
shalt
sow
the
ground
withal;
and
bread
of
the
increase
of
the
earth,
and
it
shall
be
fat
and
plenteous:
in
that
day
shall
thy
cattle
feed
in
large
pastures.
030:024
The
oxen
likewise
and
the
young
asses
that
ear
the
ground
shall
eat
clean
provender,
which
hath
been
winnowed
with
the
shovel
and
with
the
fan.
030:025
And
there
shall
be
upon
every
high
mountain,
and
upon
every
high
hill,
rivers
and
streams
of
waters
in
the
day
of
the
great
slaughter,
when
the
towers
fall.
030:026
Moreover
the
light
of
the
moon
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
sun,
and
the
light
of
the
sun
shall
be
sevenfold,
as
the
light
of
seven
days,
in
the
day
that
the
LORD
bindeth
up
the
breach
of
his
people,
and
healeth
the
stroke
of
their
wound.
030:027
Behold,
the
name
of
the
LORD
cometh
from
far,
burning
with
his
anger,
and
the
burden
thereof
is
heavy:
his
lips
are
full
of
indignation,
and
his
tongue
as
a
devouring
fire:
030:028
And
his
breath,
as
an
overflowing
stream,
shall
reach
to
the
midst
of
the
neck,
to
sift
the
nations
with
the
sieve
of
vanity:
and
there
shall
be
a
bridle
in
the
jaws
of
the
people,
causing
them
to
err.
030:029
Ye
shall
have
a
song,
as
in
the
night
when
a
holy
solemnity
is
kept;
and
gladness
of
heart,
as
when
one
goeth
with
a
pipe
to
come
into
the
mountain
of
the
LORD,
to
the
mighty
One
of
Israel.
030:030
And
the
LORD
shall
cause
his
glorious
voice
to
be
heard,
and
shall
shew
the
lighting
down
of
his
arm,
with
the
indignation
of
his
anger,
and
with
the
flame
of
a
devouring
fire,
with
scattering,
and
tempest,
and
hailstones.
030:031
For
through
the
voice
of
the
LORD
shall
the
Assyrian
be
beaten
down,
which
smote
with
a
rod.
030:032
And
in
every
place
where
the
grounded
staff
shall
pass,
which
the
LORD
shall
lay
upon
him,
it
shall
be
with
tabrets
and
harps:
and
in
battles
of
shaking
will
he
fight
with
it.
030:033
For
Tophet
is
ordained
of
old;
yea,
for
the
king
it
is
prepared;
he
hath
made
it
deep
and
large:
the
pile
thereof
is
fire
and
much
wood;
the
breath
of
the
LORD,
like
a
stream
of
brimstone,
doth
kindle
it.
031:001
Woe
to
them
that
go
down
to
Egypt
for
help;
and
stay
on
horses,
and
trust
in
chariots,
because
they
are
many;
and
in
horsemen,
because
they
are
very
strong;
but
they
look
not
unto
the
Holy
One
of
Israel,
neither
seek
the
LORD!
031:002
Yet
he
also
is
wise,
and
will
bring
evil,
and
will
not
call
back
his
words:
but
will
arise
against
the
house
of
the
evildoers,
and
against
the
help
of
them
that
work
iniquity.
031:003
Now
the
Egyptians
are
men,
and
not
God;
and
their
horses
flesh,
and
not
spirit.
When
the
LORD
shall
stretch
out
his
hand,
both
he
that
helpeth
shall
fall,
and
he
that
is
holpen
shall
fall
down,
and
they
all
shall
fail
together.
031:004
For
thus
hath
the
LORD
spoken
unto
me,
Like
as
the
lion
and
the
young
lion
roaring
on
his
prey,
when
a
multitude
of
shepherds
is
called
forth
against
him,
he
will
not
be
afraid
of
their
voice,
nor
abase
himself
for
the
noise
of
them:
so
shall
the
LORD
of
hosts
come
down
to
fight
for
mount
Zion,
and
for
the
hill
thereof.
031:005
As
birds
flying,
so
will
the
LORD
of
hosts
defend
Jerusalem;
defending
also
he
will
deliver
it;
and
passing
over
he
will
preserve
it.
031:006
Turn
ye
unto
him
from
whom
the
children
of
Israel
have
deeply
revolted.
031:007
For
in
that
day
every
man
shall
cast
away
his
idols
of
silver,
and
his
idols
of
gold,
which
your
own
hands
have
made
unto
you
for
a
sin.
031:008
Then
shall
the
Assyrian
fall
with
the
sword,
not
of
a
mighty
man;
and
the
sword,
not
of
a
mean
man,
shall
devour
him:
but
he
shall
flee
from
the
sword,
and
his
young
men
shall
be
discomfited.
031:009
And
he
shall
pass
over
to
his
strong
hold
for
fear,
and
his
princes
shall
be
afraid
of
the
ensign,
saith
the
LORD,
whose
fire
is
in
Zion,
and
his
furnace
in
Jerusalem.
032:001
Behold,
a
king
shall
reign
in
righteousness,
and
princes
shall
rule
in
judgment.
032:002
And
a
man
shall
be
as
an
hiding
place
from
the
wind,
and
a
covert
from
the
tempest;
as
rivers
of
water
in
a
dry
place,
as
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land.
032:003
And
the
eyes
of
them
that
see
shall
not
be
dim,
and
the
ears
of
them
that
hear
shall
hearken.
032:004
The
heart
also
of
the
rash
shall
understand
knowledge,
and
the
tongue
of
the
stammerers
shall
be
ready
to
speak
plainly.
032:005
The
vile
person
shall
be
no
more
called
liberal,
nor
the
churl
said
to
be
bountiful.
032:006
For
the
vile
person
will
speak
villany,
and
his
heart
will
work
iniquity,
to
practise
hypocrisy,
and
to
utter
error
against
the
LORD,
to
make
empty
the
soul
of
the
hungry,
and
he
will
cause
the
drink
of
the
thirsty
to
fail.
032:007
The
instruments
also
of
the
churl
are
evil:
he
deviseth
wicked
devices
to
destroy
the
poor
with
lying
words,
even
when
the
needy
speaketh
right.
032:008
But
the
liberal
deviseth
liberal
things;
and
by
liberal
things
shall
he
stand.
032:009
Rise
up,
ye
women
that
are
at
ease;
hear
my
voice,
ye
careless
daughters;
give
ear
unto
my
speech.
032:010
Many
days
and
years
shall
ye
be
troubled,
ye
careless
women:
for
the
vintage
shall
fail,
the
gathering
shall
not
come.
032:011
Tremble,
ye
women
that
are
at
ease;
be
troubled,
ye
careless
ones:
strip
you,
and
make
you
bare,
and
gird
sackcloth
upon
your
loins.
032:012
They
shall
lament
for
the
teats,
for
the
pleasant
fields,
for
the
fruitful
vine.
032:013
Upon
the
land
of
my
people
shall
come
up
thorns
and
briers;
yea,
upon
all
the
houses
of
joy
in
the
joyous
city:
032:014
Because
the
palaces
shall
be
forsaken;
the
multitude
of
the
city
shall
be
left;
the
forts
and
towers
shall
be
for
dens
for
ever,
a
joy
of
wild
asses,
a
pasture
of
flocks;
032:015
Until
the
spirit
be
poured
upon
us
from
on
high,
and
the
wilderness
be
a
fruitful
field,
and
the
fruitful
field
be
counted
for
a
forest.
032:016
Then
judgment
shall
dwell
in
the
wilderness,
and
righteousness
remain
in
the
fruitful
field.
032:017
And
the
work
of
righteousness
shall
be
peace;
and
the
effect
of
righteousness
quietness
and
assurance
for
ever.
032:018
And
my
people
shall
dwell
in
a
peaceable
habitation,
and
in
sure
dwellings,
and
in
quiet
resting
places;
032:019
When
it
shall
hail,
coming
down
on
the
forest;
and
the
city
shall
be
low
in
a
low
place.
032:020
Blessed
are
ye
that
sow
beside
all
waters,
that
send
forth
thither
the
feet
of
the
ox
and
the
ass.
033:001
Woe
to
thee
that
spoilest,
and
thou
wast
not
spoiled;
and
dealest
treacherously,
and
they
dealt
not
treacherously
with
thee!
when
thou
shalt
cease
to
spoil,
thou
shalt
be
spoiled;
and
when
thou
shalt
make
an
end
to
deal
treacherously,
they
shall
deal
treacherously
with
thee.
033:002
O
LORD,
be
gracious
unto
us;
we
have
waited
for
thee:
be
thou
their
arm
every
morning,
our
salvation
also
in
the
time
of
trouble.
033:003
At
the
noise
of
the
tumult
the
people
fled;
at
the
lifting
up
of
thyself
the
nations
were
scattered.
033:004
And
your
spoil
shall
be
gathered
like
the
gathering
of
the
caterpiller:
as
the
running
to
and
fro
of
locusts
shall
he
run
upon
them.
033:005
The
LORD
is
exalted;
for
he
dwelleth
on
high:
he
hath
filled
Zion
with
judgment
and
righteousness.
033:006
And
wisdom
and
knowledge
shall
be
the
stability
of
thy
times,
and
strength
of
salvation:
the
fear
of
the
LORD
is
his
treasure.
033:007
Behold,
their
valiant
ones
shall
cry
without:
the
ambassadors
of
peace
shall
weep
bitterly.
033:008
The
highways
lie
waste,
the
wayfaring
man
ceaseth:
he
hath
broken
the
covenant,
he
hath
despised
the
cities,
he
regardeth
no
man.
033:009
The
earth
mourneth
and
languisheth:
Lebanon
is
ashamed
and
hewn
down:
Sharon
is
like
a
wilderness;
and
Bashan
and
Carmel
shake
off
their
fruits.
033:010
Now
will
I
rise,
saith
the
LORD;
now
will
I
be
exalted;
now
will
I
lift
up
myself.
033:011
Ye
shall
conceive
chaff,
ye
shall
bring
forth
stubble:
your
breath,
as
fire,
shall
devour
you.
033:012
And
the
people
shall
be
as
the
burnings
of
lime:
as
thorns
cut
up
shall
they
be
burned
in
the
fire.
033:013
Hear,
ye
that
are
far
off,
what
I
have
done;
and,
ye
that
are
near,
acknowledge
my
might.
033:014
The
sinners
in
Zion
are
afraid;
fearfulness
hath
surprised
the
hypocrites.
Who
among
us
shall
dwell
with
the
devouring
fire?
who
among
us
shall
dwell
with
everlasting
burnings?
033:015
He
that
walketh
righteously,
and
speaketh
uprightly;
he
that
despiseth
the
gain
of
oppressions,
that
shaketh
his
hands
from
holding
of
bribes,
that
stoppeth
his
ears
from
hearing
of
blood,
and
shutteth
his
eyes
from
seeing
evil;
033:016
He
shall
dwell
on
high:
his
place
of
defence
shall
be
the
munitions
of
rocks:
bread
shall
be
given
him;
his
waters
shall
be
sure.
033:017
Thine
eyes
shall
see
the
king
in
his
beauty:
they
shall
behold
the
land
that
is
very
far
off.
033:018
Thine
heart
shall
meditate
terror.
Where
is
the
scribe?
where
is
the
receiver?
where
is
he
that
counted
the
towers?
033:019
Thou
shalt
not
see
a
fierce
people,
a
people
of
a
deeper
speech
than
thou
canst
perceive;
of
a
stammering
tongue,
that
thou
canst
not
understand.
033:020
Look
upon
Zion,
the
city
of
our
solemnities:
thine
eyes
shall
see
Jerusalem
a
quiet
habitation,
a
tabernacle
that
shall
not
be
taken
down;
not
one
of
the
stakes
thereof
shall
ever
be
removed,
neither
shall
any
of
the
cords
thereof
be
broken.
033:021
But
there
the
glorious
LORD
will
be
unto
us
a
place
of
broad
rivers
and
streams;
wherein
shall
go
no
galley
with
oars,
neither
shall
gallant
ship
pass
thereby.
033:022
For
the
LORD
is
our
judge,
the
LORD
is
our
lawgiver,
the
LORD
is
our
king;
he
will
save
us.
033:023
Thy
tacklings
are
loosed;
they
could
not
well
strengthen
their
mast,
they
could
not
spread
the
sail:
then
is
the
prey
of
a
great
spoil
divided;
the
lame
take
the
prey.
033:024
And
the
inhabitant
shall
not
say,
I
am
sick:
the
people
that
dwell
therein
shall
be
forgiven
their
iniquity.
034:001
Come
near,
ye
nations,
to
hear;
and
hearken,
ye
people:
let
the
earth
hear,
and
all
that
is
therein;
the
world,
and
all
things
that
come
forth
of
it.
034:002
For
the
indignation
of
the
LORD
is
upon
all
nations,
and
his
fury
upon
all
their
armies:
he
hath
utterly
destroyed
them,
he
hath
delivered
them
to
the
slaughter.
034:003
Their
slain
also
shall
be
cast
out,
and
their
stink
shall
come
up
out
of
their
carcases,
and
the
mountains
shall
be
melted
with
their
blood.
034:004
And
all
the
host
of
heaven
shall
be
dissolved,
and
the
heavens
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
scroll:
and
all
their
host
shall
fall
down,
as
the
leaf
falleth
off
from
the
vine,
and
as
a
falling
fig
from
the
fig
tree.
034:005
For
my
sword
shall
be
bathed
in
heaven:
behold,
it
shall
come
down
upon
Idumea,
and
upon
the
people
of
my
curse,
to
judgment.
034:006
The
sword
of
the
LORD
is
filled
with
blood,
it
is
made
fat
with
fatness,
and
with
the
blood
of
lambs
and
goats,
with
the
fat
of
the
kidneys
of
rams:
for
the
LORD
hath
a
sacrifice
in
Bozrah,
and
a
great
slaughter
in
the
land
of
Idumea.
034:007
And
the
unicorns
shall
come
down
with
them,
and
the
bullocks
with
the
bulls;
and
their
land
shall
be
soaked
with
blood,
and
their
dust
made
fat
with
fatness.
034:008
For
it
is
the
day
of
the
LORD's
vengeance,
and
the
year
of
recompences
for
the
controversy
of
Zion.
034:009
And
the
streams
thereof
shall
be
turned
into
pitch,
and
the
dust
thereof
into
brimstone,
and
the
land
thereof
shall
become
burning
pitch.
034:010
It
shall
not
be
quenched
night
nor
day;
the
smoke
thereof
shall
go
up
for
ever:
from
generation
to
generation
it
shall
lie
waste;
none
shall
pass
through
it
for
ever
and
ever.
034:011
But
the
cormorant
and
the
bittern
shall
possess
it;
the
owl
also
and
the
raven
shall
dwell
in
it:
and
he
shall
stretch
out
upon
it
the
line
of
confusion,
and
the
stones
of
emptiness.
034:012
They
shall
call
the
nobles
thereof
to
the
kingdom,
but
none
shall
be
there,
and
all
her
princes
shall
be
nothing.
034:013
And
thorns
shall
come
up
in
her
palaces,
nettles
and
brambles
in
the
fortresses
thereof:
and
it
shall
be
an
habitation
of
dragons,
and
a
court
for
owls.
034:014
The
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
shall
also
meet
with
the
wild
beasts
of
the
island,
and
the
satyr
shall
cry
to
his
fellow;
the
screech
owl
also
shall
rest
there,
and
find
for
herself
a
place
of
rest.
034:015
There
shall
the
great
owl
make
her
nest,
and
lay,
and
hatch,
and
gather
under
her
shadow:
there
shall
the
vultures
also
be
gathered,
every
one
with
her
mate.
034:016
Seek
ye
out
of
the
book
of
the
LORD,
and
read:
no
one
of
these
shall
fail,
none
shall
want
her
mate:
for
my
mouth
it
hath
commanded,
and
his
spirit
it
hath
gathered
them.
034:017
And
he
hath
cast
the
lot
for
them,
and
his
hand
hath
divided
it
unto
them
by
line:
they
shall
possess
it
for
ever,
from
generation
to
generation
shall
they
dwell
therein.
035:001
The
wilderness
and
the
solitary
place
shall
be
glad
for
them;
and
the
desert
shall
rejoice,
and
blossom
as
the
rose.
035:002
It
shall
blossom
abundantly,
and
rejoice
even
with
joy
and
singing:
the
glory
of
Lebanon
shall
be
given
unto
it,
the
excellency
of
Carmel
and
Sharon,
they
shall
see
the
glory
of
the
LORD,
and
the
excellency
of
our
God.
035:003
Strengthen
ye
the
weak
hands,
and
confirm
the
feeble
knees.
035:004
Say
to
them
that
are
of
a
fearful
heart,
Be
strong,
fear
not:
behold,
your
God
will
come
with
vengeance,
even
God
with
a
recompence;
he
will
come
and
save
you.
035:005
Then
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
be
opened,
and
the
ears
of
the
deaf
shall
be
unstopped.
035:006
Then
shall
the
lame
man
leap
as
an
hart,
and
the
tongue
of
the
dumb
sing:
for
in
the
wilderness
shall
waters
break
out,
and
streams
in
the
desert.
035:007
And
the
parched
ground
shall
become
a
pool,
and
the
thirsty
land
springs
of
water:
in
the
habitation
of
dragons,
where
each
lay,
shall
be
grass
with
reeds
and
rushes.
035:008
And
an
highway
shall
be
there,
and
a
way,
and
it
shall
be
called
The
way
of
holiness;
the
unclean
shall
not
pass
over
it;
but
it
shall
be
for
those:
the
wayfaring
men,
though
fools,
shall
not
err
therein.
035:009
No
lion
shall
be
there,
nor
any
ravenous
beast
shall
go
up
thereon,
it
shall
not
be
found
there;
but
the
redeemed
shall
walk
there:
035:010
And
the
ransomed
of
the
LORD
shall
return,
and
come
to
Zion
with
songs
and
everlasting
joy
upon
their
heads:
they
shall
obtain
joy
and
gladness,
and
sorrow
and
sighing
shall
flee
away.
036:001
Now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
king
Hezekiah,
that
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria
came
up
against
all
the
defenced
cities
of
Judah,
and
took
them.
036:002
And
the
king
of
Assyria
sent
Rabshakeh
from
Lachish
to
Jerusalem
unto
king
Hezekiah
with
a
great
army.
And
he
stood
by
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller's
field.
036:003
Then
came
forth
unto
him
Eliakim,
Hilkiah's
son,
which
was
over
the
house,
and
Shebna
the
scribe,
and
Joah,
Asaph's
son,
the
recorder.
036:004
And
Rabshakeh
said
unto
them,
Say
ye
now
to
Hezekiah,
Thus
saith
the
great
king,
the
king
of
Assyria,
What
confidence
is
this
wherein
thou
trustest?
036:005
I
say,
sayest
thou,
(but
they
are
but
vain
words)
I
have
counsel
and
strength
for
war:
now
on
whom
dost
thou
trust,
that
thou
rebellest
against
me?
036:006
Lo,
thou
trustest
in
the
staff
of
this
broken
reed,
on
Egypt;
whereon
if
a
man
lean,
it
will
go
into
his
hand,
and
pierce
it:
so
is
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
to
all
that
trust
in
him.
036:007
But
if
thou
say
to
me,
We
trust
in
the
LORD
our
God:
is
it
not
he,
whose
high
places
and
whose
altars
Hezekiah
hath
taken
away,
and
said
to
Judah
and
to
Jerusalem,
Ye
shall
worship
before
this
altar?
036:008
Now
therefore
give
pledges,
I
pray
thee,
to
my
master
the
king
of
Assyria,
and
I
will
give
thee
two
thousand
horses,
if
thou
be
able
on
thy
part
to
set
riders
upon
them.
036:009
How
then
wilt
thou
turn
away
the
face
of
one
captain
of
the
least
of
my
master's
servants,
and
put
thy
trust
on
Egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen?
036:010
And
am
I
now
come
up
without
the
LORD
against
this
land
to
destroy
it?
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Go
up
against
this
land,
and
destroy
it.
036:011
Then
said
Eliakim
and
Shebna
and
Joah
unto
Rabshakeh,
Speak,
I
pray
thee,
unto
thy
servants
in
the
Syrian
language;
for
we
understand
it:
and
speak
not
to
us
in
the
Jews'
language,
in
the
ears
of
the
people
that
are
on
the
wall.
036:012
But
Rabshakeh
said,
Hath
my
master
sent
me
to
thy
master
and
to
thee
to
speak
these
words?
hath
he
not
sent
me
to
the
men
that
sit
upon
the
wall,
that
they
may
eat
their
own
dung,
and
drink
their
own
piss
with
you?
036:013
Then
Rabshakeh
stood,
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
Jews'
language,
and
said,
Hear
ye
the
words
of
the
great
king,
the
king
of
Assyria.
036:014
Thus
saith
the
king,
Let
not
Hezekiah
deceive
you:
for
he
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
you.
036:015
Neither
let
Hezekiah
make
you
trust
in
the
LORD,
saying,
The
LORD
will
surely
deliver
us:
this
city
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria.
036:016
Hearken
not
to
Hezekiah:
for
thus
saith
the
king
of
Assyria,
Make
an
agreement
with
me
by
a
present,
and
come
out
to
me:
and
eat
ye
every
one
of
his
vine,
and
every
one
of
his
fig
tree,
and
drink
ye
every
one
the
waters
of
his
own
cistern;
036:017
Until
I
come
and
take
you
away
to
a
land
like
your
own
land,
a
land
of
corn
and
wine,
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards.
036:018
Beware
lest
Hezekiah
persuade
you,
saying,
the
LORD
will
deliver
us.
Hath
any
of
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
his
land
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria?
036:019
Where
are
the
gods
of
Hamath
and
Arphad?
where
are
the
gods
of
Sepharvaim?
and
have
they
delivered
Samaria
out
of
my
hand?
036:020
Who
are
they
among
all
the
gods
of
these
lands,
that
have
delivered
their
land
out
of
my
hand,
that
the
LORD
should
deliver
Jerusalem
out
of
my
hand?
036:021
But
they
held
their
peace,
and
answered
him
not
a
word:
for
the
king's
commandment
was,
saying,
Answer
him
not.
036:022
Then
came
Eliakim,
the
son
of
Hilkiah,
that
was
over
the
household,
and
Shebna
the
scribe,
and
Joah,
the
son
of
Asaph,
the
recorder,
to
Hezekiah
with
their
clothes
rent,
and
told
him
the
words
of
Rabshakeh.
037:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
king
Hezekiah
heard
it,
that
he
rent
his
clothes,
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth,
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
LORD.
037:002
And
he
sent
Eliakim,
who
was
over
the
household,
and
Shebna
the
scribe,
and
the
elders
of
the
priests
covered
with
sackcloth,
unto
Isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
Amoz.
037:003
And
they
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
Hezekiah,
This
day
is
a
day
of
trouble,
and
of
rebuke,
and
of
blasphemy:
for
the
children
are
come
to
the
birth,
and
there
is
not
strength
to
bring
forth.
037:004
It
may
be
the
LORD
thy
God
will
hear
the
words
of
Rabshakeh,
whom
the
king
of
Assyria
his
master
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
God,
and
will
reprove
the
words
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
heard:
wherefore
lift
up
thy
prayer
for
the
remnant
that
is
left.
037:005
So
the
servants
of
king
Hezekiah
came
to
Isaiah.
037:006
And
Isaiah
said
unto
them,
Thus
shall
ye
say
unto
your
master,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Be
not
afraid
of
the
words
that
thou
hast
heard,
wherewith
the
servants
of
the
king
of
Assyria
have
blasphemed
me.
037:007
Behold,
I
will
send
a
blast
upon
him,
and
he
shall
hear
a
rumour,
and
return
to
his
own
land;
and
I
will
cause
him
to
fall
by
the
sword
in
his
own
land.
037:008
So
Rabshakeh
returned,
and
found
the
king
of
Assyria
warring
against
Libnah:
for
he
had
heard
that
he
was
departed
from
Lachish.
037:009
And
he
heard
say
concerning
Tirhakah
king
of
Ethiopia,
He
is
come
forth
to
make
war
with
thee.
And
when
he
heard
it,
he
sent
messengers
to
Hezekiah,
saying,
037:010
Thus
shall
ye
speak
to
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah,
saying,
Let
not
thy
God,
in
whom
thou
trustest,
deceive
thee,
saying,
Jerusalem
shall
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria.
037:011
Behold,
thou
hast
heard
what
the
kings
of
Assyria
have
done
to
all
lands
by
destroying
them
utterly;
and
shalt
thou
be
delivered?
037:012
Have
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
them
which
my
fathers
have
destroyed,
as
Gozan,
and
Haran,
and
Rezeph,
and
the
children
of
Eden
which
were
in
Telassar?
037:013
Where
is
the
king
of
Hamath,
and
the
king
of
Arphad,
and
the
king
of
the
city
of
Sepharvaim,
Hena,
and
Ivah?
037:014
And
Hezekiah
received
the
letter
from
the
hand
of
the
messengers,
and
read
it:
and
Hezekiah
went
up
unto
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
spread
it
before
the
LORD.
037:015
And
Hezekiah
prayed
unto
the
LORD,
saying,
037:016
O
LORD
of
hosts,
God
of
Israel,
that
dwellest
between
the
cherubims,
thou
art
the
God,
even
thou
alone,
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
