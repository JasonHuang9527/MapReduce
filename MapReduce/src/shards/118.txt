the
earth:
thou
hast
made
heaven
and
earth.
037:017
Incline
thine
ear,
O
LORD,
and
hear;
open
thine
eyes,
O
LORD,
and
see:
and
hear
all
the
words
of
Sennacherib,
which
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
God.
037:018
Of
a
truth,
LORD,
the
kings
of
Assyria
have
laid
waste
all
the
nations,
and
their
countries,
037:019
And
have
cast
their
gods
into
the
fire:
for
they
were
no
gods,
but
the
work
of
men's
hands,
wood
and
stone:
therefore
they
have
destroyed
them.
037:020
Now
therefore,
O
LORD
our
God,
save
us
from
his
hand,
that
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
may
know
that
thou
art
the
LORD,
even
thou
only.
037:021
Then
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
sent
unto
Hezekiah,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Whereas
thou
hast
prayed
to
me
against
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria:
037:022
This
is
the
word
which
the
LORD
hath
spoken
concerning
him;
The
virgin,
the
daughter
of
Zion,
hath
despised
thee,
and
laughed
thee
to
scorn;
the
daughter
of
Jerusalem
hath
shaken
her
head
at
thee.
037:023
Whom
hast
thou
reproached
and
blasphemed?
and
against
whom
hast
thou
exalted
thy
voice,
and
lifted
up
thine
eyes
on
high?
even
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
037:024
By
thy
servants
hast
thou
reproached
the
Lord,
and
hast
said,
By
the
multitude
of
my
chariots
am
I
come
up
to
the
height
of
the
mountains,
to
the
sides
of
Lebanon;
and
I
will
cut
down
the
tall
cedars
thereof,
and
the
choice
fir
trees
thereof:
and
I
will
enter
into
the
height
of
his
border,
and
the
forest
of
his
Carmel.
037:025
I
have
digged,
and
drunk
water;
and
with
the
sole
of
my
feet
have
I
dried
up
all
the
rivers
of
the
besieged
places.
037:026
Hast
thou
not
heard
long
ago,
how
I
have
done
it;
and
of
ancient
times,
that
I
have
formed
it?
now
have
I
brought
it
to
pass,
that
thou
shouldest
be
to
lay
waste
defenced
cities
into
ruinous
heaps.
037:027
Therefore
their
inhabitants
were
of
small
power,
they
were
dismayed
and
confounded:
they
were
as
the
grass
of
the
field,
and
as
the
green
herb,
as
the
grass
on
the
housetops,
and
as
corn
blasted
before
it
be
grown
up.
037:028
But
I
know
thy
abode,
and
thy
going
out,
and
thy
coming
in,
and
thy
rage
against
me.
037:029
Because
thy
rage
against
me,
and
thy
tumult,
is
come
up
into
mine
ears,
therefore
will
I
put
my
hook
in
thy
nose,
and
my
bridle
in
thy
lips,
and
I
will
turn
thee
back
by
the
way
by
which
thou
camest.
037:030
And
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee,
Ye
shall
eat
this
year
such
as
groweth
of
itself;
and
the
second
year
that
which
springeth
of
the
same:
and
in
the
third
year
sow
ye,
and
reap,
and
plant
vineyards,
and
eat
the
fruit
thereof.
037:031
And
the
remnant
that
is
escaped
of
the
house
of
Judah
shall
again
take
root
downward,
and
bear
fruit
upward:
037:032
For
out
of
Jerusalem
shall
go
forth
a
remnant,
and
they
that
escape
out
of
mount
Zion:
the
zeal
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
shall
do
this.
037:033
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
concerning
the
king
of
Assyria,
He
shall
not
come
into
this
city,
nor
shoot
an
arrow
there,
nor
come
before
it
with
shields,
nor
cast
a
bank
against
it.
037:034
By
the
way
that
he
came,
by
the
same
shall
he
return,
and
shall
not
come
into
this
city,
saith
the
LORD.
037:035
For
I
will
defend
this
city
to
save
it
for
mine
own
sake,
and
for
my
servant
David's
sake.
037:036
Then
the
angel
of
the
LORD
went
forth,
and
smote
in
the
camp
of
the
Assyrians
a
hundred
and
fourscore
and
five
thousand:
and
when
they
arose
early
in
the
morning,
behold,
they
were
all
dead
corpses.
037:037
So
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria
departed,
and
went
and
returned,
and
dwelt
at
Nineveh.
037:038
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
was
worshipping
in
the
house
of
Nisroch
his
god,
that
Adrammelech
and
Sharezer
his
sons
smote
him
with
the
sword;
and
they
escaped
into
the
land
of
Armenia:
and
Esarhaddon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
038:001
In
those
days
was
Hezekiah
sick
unto
death.
And
Isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
Amoz
came
unto
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Set
thine
house
in
order:
for
thou
shalt
die,
and
not
live.
038:002
Then
Hezekiah
turned
his
face
toward
the
wall,
and
prayed
unto
the
LORD,
038:003
And
said,
Remember
now,
O
LORD,
I
beseech
thee,
how
I
have
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
with
a
perfect
heart,
and
have
done
that
which
is
good
in
thy
sight.
And
Hezekiah
wept
sore.
038:004
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
to
Isaiah,
saying,
038:005
Go,
and
say
to
Hezekiah,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
David
thy
father,
I
have
heard
thy
prayer,
I
have
seen
thy
tears:
behold,
I
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years.
038:006
And
I
will
deliver
thee
and
this
city
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria:
and
I
will
defend
this
city.
038:007
And
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
from
the
LORD,
that
the
LORD
will
do
this
thing
that
he
hath
spoken;
038:008
Behold,
I
will
bring
again
the
shadow
of
the
degrees,
which
is
gone
down
in
the
sun
dial
of
Ahaz,
ten
degrees
backward.
So
the
sun
returned
ten
degrees,
by
which
degrees
it
was
gone
down.
038:009
The
writing
of
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah,
when
he
had
been
sick,
and
was
recovered
of
his
sickness:
038:010
I
said
in
the
cutting
off
of
my
days,
I
shall
go
to
the
gates
of
the
grave:
I
am
deprived
of
the
residue
of
my
years.
038:011
I
said,
I
shall
not
see
the
LORD,
even
the
LORD,
in
the
land
of
the
living:
I
shall
behold
man
no
more
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
world.
038:012
Mine
age
is
departed,
and
is
removed
from
me
as
a
shepherd's
tent:
I
have
cut
off
like
a
weaver
my
life:
he
will
cut
me
off
with
pining
sickness:
from
day
even
to
night
wilt
thou
make
an
end
of
me.
038:013
I
reckoned
till
morning,
that,
as
a
lion,
so
will
he
break
all
my
bones:
from
day
even
to
night
wilt
thou
make
an
end
of
me.
038:014
Like
a
crane
or
a
swallow,
so
did
I
chatter:
I
did
mourn
as
a
dove:
mine
eyes
fail
with
looking
upward:
O
LORD,
I
am
oppressed;
undertake
for
me.
038:015
What
shall
I
say?
he
hath
both
spoken
unto
me,
and
himself
hath
done
it:
I
shall
go
softly
all
my
years
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul.
038:016
O
LORD,
by
these
things
men
live,
and
in
all
these
things
is
the
life
of
my
spirit:
so
wilt
thou
recover
me,
and
make
me
to
live.
038:017
Behold,
for
peace
I
had
great
bitterness:
but
thou
hast
in
love
to
my
soul
delivered
it
from
the
pit
of
corruption:
for
thou
hast
cast
all
my
sins
behind
thy
back.
038:018
For
the
grave
cannot
praise
thee,
death
can
not
celebrate
thee:
they
that
go
down
into
the
pit
cannot
hope
for
thy
truth.
038:019
The
living,
the
living,
he
shall
praise
thee,
as
I
do
this
day:
the
father
to
the
children
shall
make
known
thy
truth.
038:020
The
LORD
was
ready
to
save
me:
therefore
we
will
sing
my
songs
to
the
stringed
instruments
all
the
days
of
our
life
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
038:021
For
Isaiah
had
said,
Let
them
take
a
lump
of
figs,
and
lay
it
for
a
plaister
upon
the
boil,
and
he
shall
recover.
038:022
Hezekiah
also
had
said,
What
is
the
sign
that
I
shall
go
up
to
the
house
of
the
LORD?
039:001
At
that
time
Merodachbaladan,
the
son
of
Baladan,
king
of
Babylon,
sent
letters
and
a
present
to
Hezekiah:
for
he
had
heard
that
he
had
been
sick,
and
was
recovered.
039:002
And
Hezekiah
was
glad
of
them,
and
shewed
them
the
house
of
his
precious
things,
the
silver,
and
the
gold,
and
the
spices,
and
the
precious
ointment,
and
all
the
house
of
his
armour,
and
all
that
was
found
in
his
treasures:
there
was
nothing
in
his
house,
nor
in
all
his
dominion,
that
Hezekiah
shewed
them
not.
039:003
Then
came
Isaiah
the
prophet
unto
king
Hezekiah,
and
said
unto
him,
What
said
these
men?
and
from
whence
came
they
unto
thee?
And
Hezekiah
said,
They
are
come
from
a
far
country
unto
me,
even
from
Babylon.
039:004
Then
said
he,
What
have
they
seen
in
thine
house?
And
Hezekiah
answered,
All
that
is
in
mine
house
have
they
seen:
there
is
nothing
among
my
treasures
that
I
have
not
shewed
them.
039:005
Then
said
Isaiah
to
Hezekiah,
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD
of
hosts:
039:006
Behold,
the
days
come,
that
all
that
is
in
thine
house,
and
that
which
thy
fathers
have
laid
up
in
store
until
this
day,
shall
be
carried
to
Babylon:
nothing
shall
be
left,
saith
the
LORD.
039:007
And
of
thy
sons
that
shall
issue
from
thee,
which
thou
shalt
beget,
shall
they
take
away;
and
they
shall
be
eunuchs
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
Babylon.
039:008
Then
said
Hezekiah
to
Isaiah,
Good
is
the
word
of
the
LORD
which
thou
hast
spoken.
He
said
moreover,
For
there
shall
be
peace
and
truth
in
my
days.
040:001
Comfort
ye,
comfort
ye
my
people,
saith
your
God.
040:002
Speak
ye
comfortably
to
Jerusalem,
and
cry
unto
her,
that
her
warfare
is
accomplished,
that
her
iniquity
is
pardoned:
for
she
hath
received
of
the
LORD's
hand
double
for
all
her
sins.
040:003
The
voice
of
him
that
crieth
in
the
wilderness,
Prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
LORD,
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
God.
040:004
Every
valley
shall
be
exalted,
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
made
low:
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight,
and
the
rough
places
plain:
040:005
And
the
glory
of
the
LORD
shall
be
revealed,
and
all
flesh
shall
see
it
together:
for
the
mouth
of
the
LORD
hath
spoken
it.
040:006
The
voice
said,
Cry.
And
he
said,
What
shall
I
cry?
All
flesh
is
grass,
and
all
the
goodliness
thereof
is
as
the
flower
of
the
field:
040:007
The
grass
withereth,
the
flower
fadeth:
because
the
spirit
of
the
LORD
bloweth
upon
it:
surely
the
people
is
grass.
040:008
The
grass
withereth,
the
flower
fadeth:
but
the
word
of
our
God
shall
stand
for
ever.
040:009
O
Zion,
that
bringest
good
tidings,
get
thee
up
into
the
high
mountain;
O
Jerusalem,
that
bringest
good
tidings,
lift
up
thy
voice
with
strength;
lift
it
up,
be
not
afraid;
say
unto
the
cities
of
Judah,
Behold
your
God!
040:010
Behold,
the
Lord
GOD
will
come
with
strong
hand,
and
his
arm
shall
rule
for
him:
behold,
his
reward
is
with
him,
and
his
work
before
him.
040:011
He
shall
feed
his
flock
like
a
shepherd:
he
shall
gather
the
lambs
with
his
arm,
and
carry
them
in
his
bosom,
and
shall
gently
lead
those
that
are
with
young.
040:012
Who
hath
measured
the
waters
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand,
and
meted
out
heaven
with
the
span,
and
comprehended
the
dust
of
the
earth
in
a
measure,
and
weighed
the
mountains
in
scales,
and
the
hills
in
a
balance?
040:013
Who
hath
directed
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD,
or
being
his
counsellor
hath
taught
him?
040:014
With
whom
took
he
counsel,
and
who
instructed
him,
and
taught
him
in
the
path
of
judgment,
and
taught
him
knowledge,
and
shewed
to
him
the
way
of
understanding?
040:015
Behold,
the
nations
are
as
a
drop
of
a
bucket,
and
are
counted
as
the
small
dust
of
the
balance:
behold,
he
taketh
up
the
isles
as
a
very
little
thing.
040:016
And
Lebanon
is
not
sufficient
to
burn,
nor
the
beasts
thereof
sufficient
for
a
burnt
offering.
040:017
All
nations
before
him
are
as
nothing;
and
they
are
counted
to
him
less
than
nothing,
and
vanity.
040:018
To
whom
then
will
ye
liken
God?
or
what
likeness
will
ye
compare
unto
him?
040:019
The
workman
melteth
a
graven
image,
and
the
goldsmith
spreadeth
it
over
with
gold,
and
casteth
silver
chains.
040:020
He
that
is
so
impoverished
that
he
hath
no
oblation
chooseth
a
tree
that
will
not
rot;
he
seeketh
unto
him
a
cunning
workman
to
prepare
a
graven
image,
that
shall
not
be
moved.
040:021
Have
ye
not
known?
have
ye
not
heard?
hath
it
not
been
told
you
from
the
beginning?
have
ye
not
understood
from
the
foundations
of
the
earth?
040:022
It
is
he
that
sitteth
upon
the
circle
of
the
earth,
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
are
as
grasshoppers;
that
stretcheth
out
the
heavens
as
a
curtain,
and
spreadeth
them
out
as
a
tent
to
dwell
in:
040:023
That
bringeth
the
princes
to
nothing;
he
maketh
the
judges
of
the
earth
as
vanity.
040:024
Yea,
they
shall
not
be
planted;
yea,
they
shall
not
be
sown:
yea,
their
stock
shall
not
take
root
in
the
earth:
and
he
shall
also
blow
upon
them,
and
they
shall
wither,
and
the
whirlwind
shall
take
them
away
as
stubble.
040:025
To
whom
then
will
ye
liken
me,
or
shall
I
be
equal?
saith
the
Holy
One.
040:026
Lift
up
your
eyes
on
high,
and
behold
who
hath
created
these
things,
that
bringeth
out
their
host
by
number:
he
calleth
them
all
by
names
by
the
greatness
of
his
might,
for
that
he
is
strong
in
power;
not
one
faileth.
040:027
Why
sayest
thou,
O
Jacob,
and
speakest,
O
Israel,
My
way
is
hid
from
the
LORD,
and
my
judgment
is
passed
over
from
my
God?
040:028
Hast
thou
not
known?
hast
thou
not
heard,
that
the
everlasting
God,
the
LORD,
the
Creator
of
the
ends
of
the
earth,
fainteth
not,
neither
is
weary?
there
is
no
searching
of
his
understanding.
040:029
He
giveth
power
to
the
faint;
and
to
them
that
have
no
might
he
increaseth
strength.
040:030
Even
the
youths
shall
faint
and
be
weary,
and
the
young
men
shall
utterly
fall:
040:031
But
they
that
wait
upon
the
LORD
shall
renew
their
strength;
they
shall
mount
up
with
wings
as
eagles;
they
shall
run,
and
not
be
weary;
and
they
shall
walk,
and
not
faint.
041:001
Keep
silence
before
me,
O
islands;
and
let
the
people
renew
their
strength:
let
them
come
near;
then
let
them
speak:
let
us
come
near
together
to
judgment.
041:002
Who
raised
up
the
righteous
man
from
the
east,
called
him
to
his
foot,
gave
the
nations
before
him,
and
made
him
rule
over
kings?
he
gave
them
as
the
dust
to
his
sword,
and
as
driven
stubble
to
his
bow.
041:003
He
pursued
them,
and
passed
safely;
even
by
the
way
that
he
had
not
gone
with
his
feet.
041:004
Who
hath
wrought
and
done
it,
calling
the
generations
from
the
beginning?
I
the
LORD,
the
first,
and
with
the
last;
I
am
he.
041:005
The
isles
saw
it,
and
feared;
the
ends
of
the
earth
were
afraid,
drew
near,
and
came.
041:006
They
helped
every
one
his
neighbour;
and
every
one
said
to
his
brother,
Be
of
good
courage.
041:007
So
the
carpenter
encouraged
the
goldsmith,
and
he
that
smootheth
with
the
hammer
him
that
smote
the
anvil,
saying,
It
is
ready
for
the
sodering:
and
he
fastened
it
with
nails,
that
it
should
not
be
moved.
041:008
But
thou,
Israel,
art
my
servant,
Jacob
whom
I
have
chosen,
the
seed
of
Abraham
my
friend.
041:009
Thou
whom
I
have
taken
from
the
ends
of
the
earth,
and
called
thee
from
the
chief
men
thereof,
and
said
unto
thee,
Thou
art
my
servant;
I
have
chosen
thee,
and
not
cast
thee
away.
041:010
Fear
thou
not;
for
I
am
with
thee:
be
not
dismayed;
for
I
am
thy
God:
I
will
strengthen
thee;
yea,
I
will
help
thee;
yea,
I
will
uphold
thee
with
the
right
hand
of
my
righteousness.
041:011
Behold,
all
they
that
were
incensed
against
thee
shall
be
ashamed
and
confounded:
they
shall
be
as
nothing;
and
they
that
strive
with
thee
shall
perish.
041:012
Thou
shalt
seek
them,
and
shalt
not
find
them,
even
them
that
contended
with
thee:
they
that
war
against
thee
shall
be
as
nothing,
and
as
a
thing
of
nought.
041:013
For
I
the
LORD
thy
God
will
hold
thy
right
hand,
saying
unto
thee,
Fear
not;
I
will
help
thee.
041:014
Fear
not,
thou
worm
Jacob,
and
ye
men
of
Israel;
I
will
help
thee,
saith
the
LORD,
and
thy
redeemer,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
041:015
Behold,
I
will
make
thee
a
new
sharp
threshing
instrument
having
teeth:
thou
shalt
thresh
the
mountains,
and
beat
them
small,
and
shalt
make
the
hills
as
chaff.
041:016
Thou
shalt
fan
them,
and
the
wind
shall
carry
them
away,
and
the
whirlwind
shall
scatter
them:
and
thou
shalt
rejoice
in
the
LORD,
and
shalt
glory
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
041:017
When
the
poor
and
needy
seek
water,
and
there
is
none,
and
their
tongue
faileth
for
thirst,
I
the
LORD
will
hear
them,
I
the
God
of
Israel
will
not
forsake
them.
041:018
I
will
open
rivers
in
high
places,
and
fountains
in
the
midst
of
the
valleys:
I
will
make
the
wilderness
a
pool
of
water,
and
the
dry
land
springs
of
water.
041:019
I
will
plant
in
the
wilderness
the
cedar,
the
shittah
tree,
and
the
myrtle,
and
the
oil
tree;
I
will
set
in
the
desert
the
fir
tree,
and
the
pine,
and
the
box
tree
together:
041:020
That
they
may
see,
and
know,
and
consider,
and
understand
together,
that
the
hand
of
the
LORD
hath
done
this,
and
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
hath
created
it.
041:021
Produce
your
cause,
saith
the
LORD;
bring
forth
your
strong
reasons,
saith
the
King
of
Jacob.
041:022
Let
them
bring
them
forth,
and
shew
us
what
shall
happen:
let
them
shew
the
former
things,
what
they
be,
that
we
may
consider
them,
and
know
the
latter
end
of
them;
or
declare
us
things
for
to
come.
041:023
Shew
the
things
that
are
to
come
hereafter,
that
we
may
know
that
ye
are
gods:
yea,
do
good,
or
do
evil,
that
we
may
be
dismayed,
and
behold
it
together.
041:024
Behold,
ye
are
of
nothing,
and
your
work
of
nought:
an
abomination
is
he
that
chooseth
you.
041:025
I
have
raised
up
one
from
the
north,
and
he
shall
come:
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
shall
he
call
upon
my
name:
and
he
shall
come
upon
princes
as
upon
morter,
and
as
the
potter
treadeth
clay.
041:026
Who
hath
declared
from
the
beginning,
that
we
may
know?
and
beforetime,
that
we
may
say,
He
is
righteous?
yea,
there
is
none
that
sheweth,
yea,
there
is
none
that
declareth,
yea,
there
is
none
that
heareth
your
words.
041:027
The
first
shall
say
to
Zion,
Behold,
behold
them:
and
I
will
give
to
Jerusalem
one
that
bringeth
good
tidings.
041:028
For
I
beheld,
and
there
was
no
man;
even
among
them,
and
there
was
no
counsellor,
that,
when
I
asked
of
them,
could
answer
a
word.
041:029
Behold,
they
are
all
vanity;
their
works
are
nothing:
their
molten
images
are
wind
and
confusion.
042:001
Behold
my
servant,
whom
I
uphold;
mine
elect,
in
whom
my
soul
delighteth;
I
have
put
my
spirit
upon
him:
he
shall
bring
forth
judgment
to
the
Gentiles.
042:002
He
shall
not
cry,
nor
lift
up,
nor
cause
his
voice
to
be
heard
in
the
street.
042:003
A
bruised
reed
shall
he
not
break,
and
the
smoking
flax
shall
he
not
quench:
he
shall
bring
forth
judgment
unto
truth.
042:004
He
shall
not
fail
nor
be
discouraged,
till
he
have
set
judgment
in
the
earth:
and
the
isles
shall
wait
for
his
law.
042:005
Thus
saith
God
the
LORD,
he
that
created
the
heavens,
and
stretched
them
out;
he
that
spread
forth
the
earth,
and
that
which
cometh
out
of
it;
he
that
giveth
breath
unto
the
people
upon
it,
and
spirit
to
them
that
walk
therein:
042:006
I
the
LORD
have
called
thee
in
righteousness,
and
will
hold
thine
hand,
and
will
keep
thee,
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people,
for
a
light
of
the
Gentiles;
042:007
To
open
the
blind
eyes,
to
bring
out
the
prisoners
from
the
prison,
and
them
that
sit
in
darkness
out
of
the
prison
house.
042:008
I
am
the
LORD:
that
is
my
name:
and
my
glory
will
I
not
give
to
another,
neither
my
praise
to
graven
images.
042:009
Behold,
the
former
things
are
come
to
pass,
and
new
things
do
I
declare:
before
they
spring
forth
I
tell
you
of
them.
042:010
Sing
unto
the
LORD
a
new
song,
and
his
praise
from
the
end
of
the
earth,
ye
that
go
down
to
the
sea,
and
all
that
is
therein;
the
isles,
and
the
inhabitants
thereof.
042:011
Let
the
wilderness
and
the
cities
thereof
lift
up
their
voice,
the
villages
that
Kedar
doth
inhabit:
let
the
inhabitants
of
the
rock
sing,
let
them
shout
from
the
top
of
the
mountains.
042:012
Let
them
give
glory
unto
the
LORD,
and
declare
his
praise
in
the
islands.
042:013
The
LORD
shall
go
forth
as
a
mighty
man,
he
shall
stir
up
jealousy
like
a
man
of
war:
he
shall
cry,
yea,
roar;
he
shall
prevail
against
his
enemies.
042:014
I
have
long
time
holden
my
peace;
I
have
been
still,
and
refrained
myself:
now
will
I
cry
like
a
travailing
woman;
I
will
destroy
and
devour
at
once.
042:015
I
will
make
waste
mountains
and
hills,
and
dry
up
all
their
herbs;
and
I
will
make
the
rivers
islands,
and
I
will
dry
up
the
pools.
042:016
And
I
will
bring
the
blind
by
a
way
that
they
knew
not;
I
will
lead
them
in
paths
that
they
have
not
known:
I
will
make
darkness
light
before
them,
and
crooked
things
straight.
These
things
will
I
do
unto
them,
and
not
forsake
them.
042:017
They
shall
be
turned
back,
they
shall
be
greatly
ashamed,
that
trust
in
graven
images,
that
say
to
the
molten
images,
Ye
are
our
gods.
042:018
Hear,
ye
deaf;
and
look,
ye
blind,
that
ye
may
see.
042:019
Who
is
blind,
but
my
servant?
or
deaf,
as
my
messenger
that
I
sent?
who
is
blind
as
he
that
is
perfect,
and
blind
as
the
LORD's
servant?
042:020
Seeing
many
things,
but
thou
observest
not;
opening
the
ears,
but
he
heareth
not.
042:021
The
LORD
is
well
pleased
for
his
righteousness'
sake;
he
will
magnify
the
law,
and
make
it
honourable.
042:022
But
this
is
a
people
robbed
and
spoiled;
they
are
all
of
them
snared
in
holes,
and
they
are
hid
in
prison
houses:
they
are
for
a
prey,
and
none
delivereth;
for
a
spoil,
and
none
saith,
Restore.
042:023
Who
among
you
will
give
ear
to
this?
who
will
hearken
and
hear
for
the
time
to
come?
042:024
Who
gave
Jacob
for
a
spoil,
and
Israel
to
the
robbers?
did
not
the
LORD,
he
against
whom
we
have
sinned?
for
they
would
not
walk
in
his
ways,
neither
were
they
obedient
unto
his
law.
042:025
Therefore
he
hath
poured
upon
him
the
fury
of
his
anger,
and
the
strength
of
battle:
and
it
hath
set
him
on
fire
round
about,
yet
he
knew
not;
and
it
burned
him,
yet
he
laid
it
not
to
heart.
043:001
But
now
thus
saith
the
LORD
that
created
thee,
O
Jacob,
and
he
that
formed
thee,
O
Israel,
Fear
not:
for
I
have
redeemed
thee,
I
have
called
thee
by
thy
name;
thou
art
mine.
043:002
When
thou
passest
through
the
waters,
I
will
be
with
thee;
and
through
the
rivers,
they
shall
not
overflow
thee:
when
thou
walkest
through
the
fire,
thou
shalt
not
be
burned;
neither
shall
the
flame
kindle
upon
thee.
043:003
For
I
am
the
LORD
thy
God,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel,
thy
Saviour:
I
gave
Egypt
for
thy
ransom,
Ethiopia
and
Seba
for
thee.
043:004
Since
thou
wast
precious
in
my
sight,
thou
hast
been
honourable,
and
I
have
loved
thee:
therefore
will
I
give
men
for
thee,
and
people
for
thy
life.
043:005
Fear
not:
for
I
am
