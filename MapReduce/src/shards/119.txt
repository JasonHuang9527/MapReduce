with
thee:
I
will
bring
thy
seed
from
the
east,
and
gather
thee
from
the
west;
043:006
I
will
say
to
the
north,
Give
up;
and
to
the
south,
Keep
not
back:
bring
my
sons
from
far,
and
my
daughters
from
the
ends
of
the
earth;
043:007
Even
every
one
that
is
called
by
my
name:
for
I
have
created
him
for
my
glory,
I
have
formed
him;
yea,
I
have
made
him.
043:008
Bring
forth
the
blind
people
that
have
eyes,
and
the
deaf
that
have
ears.
043:009
Let
all
the
nations
be
gathered
together,
and
let
the
people
be
assembled:
who
among
them
can
declare
this,
and
shew
us
former
things?
let
them
bring
forth
their
witnesses,
that
they
may
be
justified:
or
let
them
hear,
and
say,
It
is
truth.
043:010
Ye
are
my
witnesses,
saith
the
LORD,
and
my
servant
whom
I
have
chosen:
that
ye
may
know
and
believe
me,
and
understand
that
I
am
he:
before
me
there
was
no
God
formed,
neither
shall
there
be
after
me.
043:011
I,
even
I,
am
the
LORD;
and
beside
me
there
is
no
saviour.
043:012
I
have
declared,
and
have
saved,
and
I
have
shewed,
when
there
was
no
strange
god
among
you:
therefore
ye
are
my
witnesses,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
am
God.
043:013
Yea,
before
the
day
was
I
am
he;
and
there
is
none
that
can
deliver
out
of
my
hand:
I
will
work,
and
who
shall
let
it?
043:014
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
your
redeemer,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel;
For
your
sake
I
have
sent
to
Babylon,
and
have
brought
down
all
their
nobles,
and
the
Chaldeans,
whose
cry
is
in
the
ships.
043:015
I
am
the
LORD,
your
Holy
One,
the
creator
of
Israel,
your
King.
043:016
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
which
maketh
a
way
in
the
sea,
and
a
path
in
the
mighty
waters;
043:017
Which
bringeth
forth
the
chariot
and
horse,
the
army
and
the
power;
they
shall
lie
down
together,
they
shall
not
rise:
they
are
extinct,
they
are
quenched
as
tow.
043:018
Remember
ye
not
the
former
things,
neither
consider
the
things
of
old.
043:019
Behold,
I
will
do
a
new
thing;
now
it
shall
spring
forth;
shall
ye
not
know
it?
I
will
even
make
a
way
in
the
wilderness,
and
rivers
in
the
desert.
043:020
The
beast
of
the
field
shall
honour
me,
the
dragons
and
the
owls:
because
I
give
waters
in
the
wilderness,
and
rivers
in
the
desert,
to
give
drink
to
my
people,
my
chosen.
043:021
This
people
have
I
formed
for
myself;
they
shall
shew
forth
my
praise.
043:022
But
thou
hast
not
called
upon
me,
O
Jacob;
but
thou
hast
been
weary
of
me,
O
Israel.
043:023
Thou
hast
not
brought
me
the
small
cattle
of
thy
burnt
offerings;
neither
hast
thou
honoured
me
with
thy
sacrifices.
I
have
not
caused
thee
to
serve
with
an
offering,
nor
wearied
thee
with
incense.
043:024
Thou
hast
bought
me
no
sweet
cane
with
money,
neither
hast
thou
filled
me
with
the
fat
of
thy
sacrifices:
but
thou
hast
made
me
to
serve
with
thy
sins,
thou
hast
wearied
me
with
thine
iniquities.
043:025
I,
even
I,
am
he
that
blotteth
out
thy
transgressions
for
mine
own
sake,
and
will
not
remember
thy
sins.
043:026
Put
me
in
remembrance:
let
us
plead
together:
declare
thou,
that
thou
mayest
be
justified.
043:027
Thy
first
father
hath
sinned,
and
thy
teachers
have
transgressed
against
me.
043:028
Therefore
I
have
profaned
the
princes
of
the
sanctuary,
and
have
given
Jacob
to
the
curse,
and
Israel
to
reproaches.
044:001
Yet
now
hear,
O
Jacob
my
servant;
and
Israel,
whom
I
have
chosen:
044:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD
that
made
thee,
and
formed
thee
from
the
womb,
which
will
help
thee;
Fear
not,
O
Jacob,
my
servant;
and
thou,
Jesurun,
whom
I
have
chosen.
044:003
For
I
will
pour
water
upon
him
that
is
thirsty,
and
floods
upon
the
dry
ground:
I
will
pour
my
spirit
upon
thy
seed,
and
my
blessing
upon
thine
offspring:
044:004
And
they
shall
spring
up
as
among
the
grass,
as
willows
by
the
water
courses.
044:005
One
shall
say,
I
am
the
LORD's;
and
another
shall
call
himself
by
the
name
of
Jacob;
and
another
shall
subscribe
with
his
hand
unto
the
LORD,
and
surname
himself
by
the
name
of
Israel.
044:006
Thus
saith
the
LORD
the
King
of
Israel,
and
his
redeemer
the
LORD
of
hosts;
I
am
the
first,
and
I
am
the
last;
and
beside
me
there
is
no
God.
044:007
And
who,
as
I,
shall
call,
and
shall
declare
it,
and
set
it
in
order
for
me,
since
I
appointed
the
ancient
people?
and
the
things
that
are
coming,
and
shall
come,
let
them
shew
unto
them.
044:008
Fear
ye
not,
neither
be
afraid:
have
not
I
told
thee
from
that
time,
and
have
declared
it?
ye
are
even
my
witnesses.
Is
there
a
God
beside
me?
yea,
there
is
no
God;
I
know
not
any.
044:009
They
that
make
a
graven
image
are
all
of
them
vanity;
and
their
delectable
things
shall
not
profit;
and
they
are
their
own
witnesses;
they
see
not,
nor
know;
that
they
may
be
ashamed.
044:010
Who
hath
formed
a
god,
or
molten
a
graven
image
that
is
profitable
for
nothing?
044:011
Behold,
all
his
fellows
shall
be
ashamed:
and
the
workmen,
they
are
of
men:
let
them
all
be
gathered
together,
let
them
stand
up;
yet
they
shall
fear,
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
together.
044:012
The
smith
with
the
tongs
both
worketh
in
the
coals,
and
fashioneth
it
with
hammers,
and
worketh
it
with
the
strength
of
his
arms:
yea,
he
is
hungry,
and
his
strength
faileth:
he
drinketh
no
water,
and
is
faint.
044:013
The
carpenter
stretcheth
out
his
rule;
he
marketh
it
out
with
a
line;
he
fitteth
it
with
planes,
and
he
marketh
it
out
with
the
compass,
and
maketh
it
after
the
figure
of
a
man,
according
to
the
beauty
of
a
man;
that
it
may
remain
in
the
house.
044:014
He
heweth
him
down
cedars,
and
taketh
the
cypress
and
the
oak,
which
he
strengtheneth
for
himself
among
the
trees
of
the
forest:
he
planteth
an
ash,
and
the
rain
doth
nourish
it.
044:015
Then
shall
it
be
for
a
man
to
burn:
for
he
will
take
thereof,
and
warm
himself;
yea,
he
kindleth
it,
and
baketh
bread;
yea,
he
maketh
a
god,
and
worshippeth
it;
he
maketh
it
a
graven
image,
and
falleth
down
thereto.
044:016
He
burneth
part
thereof
in
the
fire;
with
part
thereof
he
eateth
flesh;
he
roasteth
roast,
and
is
satisfied:
yea,
he
warmeth
himself,
and
saith,
Aha,
I
am
warm,
I
have
seen
the
fire:
044:017
And
the
residue
thereof
he
maketh
a
god,
even
his
graven
image:
he
falleth
down
unto
it,
and
worshippeth
it,
and
prayeth
unto
it,
and
saith,
Deliver
me;
for
thou
art
my
god.
044:018
They
have
not
known
nor
understood:
for
he
hath
shut
their
eyes,
that
they
cannot
see;
and
their
hearts,
that
they
cannot
understand.
044:019
And
none
considereth
in
his
heart,
neither
is
there
knowledge
nor
understanding
to
say,
I
have
burned
part
of
it
in
the
fire;
yea,
also
I
have
baked
bread
upon
the
coals
thereof;
I
have
roasted
flesh,
and
eaten
it:
and
shall
I
make
the
residue
thereof
an
abomination?
shall
I
fall
down
to
the
stock
of
a
tree?
044:020
He
feedeth
on
ashes:
a
deceived
heart
hath
turned
him
aside,
that
he
cannot
deliver
his
soul,
nor
say,
Is
there
not
a
lie
in
my
right
hand?
044:021
Remember
these,
O
Jacob
and
Israel;
for
thou
art
my
servant:
I
have
formed
thee;
thou
art
my
servant:
O
Israel,
thou
shalt
not
be
forgotten
of
me.
044:022
I
have
blotted
out,
as
a
thick
cloud,
thy
transgressions,
and,
as
a
cloud,
thy
sins:
return
unto
me;
for
I
have
redeemed
thee.
044:023
Sing,
O
ye
heavens;
for
the
LORD
hath
done
it:
shout,
ye
lower
parts
of
the
earth:
break
forth
into
singing,
ye
mountains,
O
forest,
and
every
tree
therein:
for
the
LORD
hath
redeemed
Jacob,
and
glorified
himself
in
Israel.
044:024
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
thy
redeemer,
and
he
that
formed
thee
from
the
womb,
I
am
the
LORD
that
maketh
all
things;
that
stretcheth
forth
the
heavens
alone;
that
spreadeth
abroad
the
earth
by
myself;
044:025
That
frustrateth
the
tokens
of
the
liars,
and
maketh
diviners
mad;
that
turneth
wise
men
backward,
and
maketh
their
knowledge
foolish;
044:026
That
confirmeth
the
word
of
his
servant,
and
performeth
the
counsel
of
his
messengers;
that
saith
to
Jerusalem,
Thou
shalt
be
inhabited;
and
to
the
cities
of
Judah,
Ye
shall
be
built,
and
I
will
raise
up
the
decayed
places
thereof:
044:027
That
saith
to
the
deep,
Be
dry,
and
I
will
dry
up
thy
rivers:
044:028
That
saith
of
Cyrus,
He
is
my
shepherd,
and
shall
perform
all
my
pleasure:
even
saying
to
Jerusalem,
Thou
shalt
be
built;
and
to
the
temple,
Thy
foundation
shall
be
laid.
045:001
Thus
saith
the
LORD
to
his
anointed,
to
Cyrus,
whose
right
hand
I
have
holden,
to
subdue
nations
before
him;
and
I
will
loose
the
loins
of
kings,
to
open
before
him
the
two
leaved
gates;
and
the
gates
shall
not
be
shut;
045:002
I
will
go
before
thee,
and
make
the
crooked
places
straight:
I
will
break
in
pieces
the
gates
of
brass,
and
cut
in
sunder
the
bars
of
iron:
045:003
And
I
will
give
thee
the
treasures
of
darkness,
and
hidden
riches
of
secret
places,
that
thou
mayest
know
that
I,
the
LORD,
which
call
thee
by
thy
name,
am
the
God
of
Israel.
045:004
For
Jacob
my
servant's
sake,
and
Israel
mine
elect,
I
have
even
called
thee
by
thy
name:
I
have
surnamed
thee,
though
thou
hast
not
known
me.
045:005
I
am
the
LORD,
and
there
is
none
else,
there
is
no
God
beside
me:
I
girded
thee,
though
thou
hast
not
known
me:
045:006
That
they
may
know
from
the
rising
of
the
sun,
and
from
the
west,
that
there
is
none
beside
me.
I
am
the
LORD,
and
there
is
none
else.
045:007
I
form
the
light,
and
create
darkness:
I
make
peace,
and
create
evil:
I
the
LORD
do
all
these
things.
045:008
Drop
down,
ye
heavens,
from
above,
and
let
the
skies
pour
down
righteousness:
let
the
earth
open,
and
let
them
bring
forth
salvation,
and
let
righteousness
spring
up
together;
I
the
LORD
have
created
it.
045:009
Woe
unto
him
that
striveth
with
his
Maker!
Let
the
potsherd
strive
with
the
potsherds
of
the
earth.
Shall
the
clay
say
to
him
that
fashioneth
it,
What
makest
thou?
or
thy
work,
He
hath
no
hands?
045:010
Woe
unto
him
that
saith
unto
his
father,
What
begettest
thou?
or
to
the
woman,
What
hast
thou
brought
forth?
045:011
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel,
and
his
Maker,
Ask
me
of
things
to
come
concerning
my
sons,
and
concerning
the
work
of
my
hands
command
ye
me.
045:012
I
have
made
the
earth,
and
created
man
upon
it:
I,
even
my
hands,
have
stretched
out
the
heavens,
and
all
their
host
have
I
commanded.
045:013
I
have
raised
him
up
in
righteousness,
and
I
will
direct
all
his
ways:
he
shall
build
my
city,
and
he
shall
let
go
my
captives,
not
for
price
nor
reward,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
045:014
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
The
labour
of
Egypt,
and
merchandise
of
Ethiopia
and
of
the
Sabeans,
men
of
stature,
shall
come
over
unto
thee,
and
they
shall
be
thine:
they
shall
come
after
thee;
in
chains
they
shall
come
over,
and
they
shall
fall
down
unto
thee,
they
shall
make
supplication
unto
thee,
saying,
Surely
God
is
in
thee;
and
there
is
none
else,
there
is
no
God.
045:015
Verily
thou
art
a
God
that
hidest
thyself,
O
God
of
Israel,
the
Saviour.
045:016
They
shall
be
ashamed,
and
also
confounded,
all
of
them:
they
shall
go
to
confusion
together
that
are
makers
of
idols.
045:017
But
Israel
shall
be
saved
in
the
LORD
with
an
everlasting
salvation:
ye
shall
not
be
ashamed
nor
confounded
world
without
end.
045:018
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
that
created
the
heavens;
God
himself
that
formed
the
earth
and
made
it;
he
hath
established
it,
he
created
it
not
in
vain,
he
formed
it
to
be
inhabited:
I
am
the
LORD;
and
there
is
none
else.
045:019
I
have
not
spoken
in
secret,
in
a
dark
place
of
the
earth:
I
said
not
unto
the
seed
of
Jacob,
Seek
ye
me
in
vain:
I
the
LORD
speak
righteousness,
I
declare
things
that
are
right.
045:020
Assemble
yourselves
and
come;
draw
near
together,
ye
that
are
escaped
of
the
nations:
they
have
no
knowledge
that
set
up
the
wood
of
their
graven
image,
and
pray
unto
a
god
that
cannot
save.
045:021
Tell
ye,
and
bring
them
near;
yea,
let
them
take
counsel
together:
who
hath
declared
this
from
ancient
time?
who
hath
told
it
from
that
time?
have
not
I
the
LORD?
and
there
is
no
God
else
beside
me;
a
just
God
and
a
Saviour;
there
is
none
beside
me.
045:022
Look
unto
me,
and
be
ye
saved,
all
the
ends
of
the
earth:
for
I
am
God,
and
there
is
none
else.
045:023
I
have
sworn
by
myself,
the
word
is
gone
out
of
my
mouth
in
righteousness,
and
shall
not
return,
That
unto
me
every
knee
shall
bow,
every
tongue
shall
swear.
045:024
Surely,
shall
one
say,
in
the
LORD
have
I
righteousness
and
strength:
even
to
him
shall
men
come;
and
all
that
are
incensed
against
him
shall
be
ashamed.
045:025
In
the
LORD
shall
all
the
seed
of
Israel
be
justified,
and
shall
glory.
046:001
Bel
boweth
down,
Nebo
stoopeth,
their
idols
were
upon
the
beasts,
and
upon
the
cattle:
your
carriages
were
heavy
loaden;
they
are
a
burden
to
the
weary
beast.
046:002
They
stoop,
they
bow
down
together;
they
could
not
deliver
the
burden,
but
themselves
are
gone
into
captivity.
046:003
Hearken
unto
me,
O
house
of
Jacob,
and
all
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israel,
which
are
borne
by
me
from
the
belly,
which
are
carried
from
the
womb:
046:004
And
even
to
your
old
age
I
am
he;
and
even
to
hoar
hairs
will
I
carry
you:
I
have
made,
and
I
will
bear;
even
I
will
carry,
and
will
deliver
you.
046:005
To
whom
will
ye
liken
me,
and
make
me
equal,
and
compare
me,
that
we
may
be
like?
046:006
They
lavish
gold
out
of
the
bag,
and
weigh
silver
in
the
balance,
and
hire
a
goldsmith;
and
he
maketh
it
a
god:
they
fall
down,
yea,
they
worship.
046:007
They
bear
him
upon
the
shoulder,
they
carry
him,
and
set
him
in
his
place,
and
he
standeth;
from
his
place
shall
he
not
remove:
yea,
one
shall
cry
unto
him,
yet
can
he
not
answer,
nor
save
him
out
of
his
trouble.
046:008
Remember
this,
and
shew
yourselves
men:
bring
it
again
to
mind,
O
ye
transgressors.
046:009
Remember
the
former
things
of
old:
for
I
am
God,
and
there
is
none
else;
I
am
God,
and
there
is
none
like
me,
046:010
Declaring
the
end
from
the
beginning,
and
from
ancient
times
the
things
that
are
not
yet
done,
saying,
My
counsel
shall
stand,
and
I
will
do
all
my
pleasure:
046:011
Calling
a
ravenous
bird
from
the
east,
the
man
that
executeth
my
counsel
from
a
far
country:
yea,
I
have
spoken
it,
I
will
also
bring
it
to
pass;
I
have
purposed
it,
I
will
also
do
it.
046:012
Hearken
unto
me,
ye
stouthearted,
that
are
far
from
righteousness:
046:013
I
bring
near
my
righteousness;
it
shall
not
be
far
off,
and
my
salvation
shall
not
tarry:
and
I
will
place
salvation
in
Zion
for
Israel
my
glory.
047:001
Come
down,
and
sit
in
the
dust,
O
virgin
daughter
of
Babylon,
sit
on
the
ground:
there
is
no
throne,
O
daughter
of
the
Chaldeans:
for
thou
shalt
no
more
be
called
tender
and
delicate.
047:002
Take
the
millstones,
and
grind
meal:
uncover
thy
locks,
make
bare
the
leg,
uncover
the
thigh,
pass
over
the
rivers.
047:003
Thy
nakedness
shall
be
uncovered,
yea,
thy
shame
shall
be
seen:
I
will
take
vengeance,
and
I
will
not
meet
thee
as
a
man.
047:004
As
for
our
redeemer,
the
LORD
of
hosts
is
his
name,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
047:005
Sit
thou
silent,
and
get
thee
into
darkness,
O
daughter
of
the
Chaldeans:
for
thou
shalt
no
more
be
called,
The
lady
of
kingdoms.
047:006
I
was
wroth
with
my
people,
I
have
polluted
mine
inheritance,
and
given
them
into
thine
hand:
thou
didst
shew
them
no
mercy;
upon
the
ancient
hast
thou
very
heavily
laid
thy
yoke.
047:007
And
thou
saidst,
I
shall
be
a
lady
for
ever:
so
that
thou
didst
not
lay
these
things
to
thy
heart,
neither
didst
remember
the
latter
end
of
it.
047:008
Therefore
hear
now
this,
thou
that
art
given
to
pleasures,
that
dwellest
carelessly,
that
sayest
in
thine
heart,
I
am,
and
none
else
beside
me;
I
shall
not
sit
as
a
widow,
neither
shall
I
know
the
loss
of
children:
047:009
But
these
two
things
shall
come
to
thee
in
a
moment
in
one
day,
the
loss
of
children,
and
widowhood:
they
shall
come
upon
thee
in
their
perfection
for
the
multitude
of
thy
sorceries,
and
for
the
great
abundance
of
thine
enchantments.
047:010
For
thou
hast
trusted
in
thy
wickedness:
thou
hast
said,
None
seeth
me.
Thy
wisdom
and
thy
knowledge,
it
hath
perverted
thee;
and
thou
hast
said
in
thine
heart,
I
am,
and
none
else
beside
me.
047:011
Therefore
shall
evil
come
upon
thee;
thou
shalt
not
know
from
whence
it
riseth:
and
mischief
shall
fall
upon
thee;
thou
shalt
not
be
able
to
put
it
off:
and
desolation
shall
come
upon
thee
suddenly,
which
thou
shalt
not
know.
047:012
Stand
now
with
thine
enchantments,
and
with
the
multitude
of
thy
sorceries,
wherein
thou
hast
laboured
from
thy
youth;
if
so
be
thou
shalt
be
able
to
profit,
if
so
be
thou
mayest
prevail.
047:013
Thou
art
wearied
in
the
multitude
of
thy
counsels.
Let
now
the
astrologers,
the
stargazers,
the
monthly
prognosticators,
stand
up,
and
save
thee
from
these
things
that
shall
come
upon
thee.
047:014
Behold,
they
shall
be
as
stubble;
the
fire
shall
burn
them;
they
shall
not
deliver
themselves
from
the
power
of
the
flame:
there
shall
not
be
a
coal
to
warm
at,
nor
fire
to
sit
before
it.
047:015
Thus
shall
they
be
unto
thee
with
whom
thou
hast
laboured,
even
thy
merchants,
from
thy
youth:
they
shall
wander
every
one
to
his
quarter;
none
shall
save
thee.
048:001
Hear
ye
this,
O
house
of
Jacob,
which
are
called
by
the
name
of
Israel,
and
are
come
forth
out
of
the
waters
of
Judah,
which
swear
by
the
name
of
the
LORD,
and
make
mention
of
the
God
of
Israel,
but
not
in
truth,
nor
in
righteousness.
048:002
For
they
call
themselves
of
the
holy
city,
and
stay
themselves
upon
the
God
of
Israel;
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
his
name.
048:003
I
have
declared
the
former
things
from
the
beginning;
and
they
went
forth
out
of
my
mouth,
and
I
shewed
them;
I
did
them
suddenly,
and
they
came
to
pass.
048:004
Because
I
knew
that
thou
art
obstinate,
and
thy
neck
is
an
iron
sinew,
and
thy
brow
brass;
048:005
I
have
even
from
the
beginning
declared
it
to
thee;
before
it
came
to
pass
I
shewed
it
thee:
lest
thou
shouldest
say,
Mine
idol
hath
done
them,
and
my
graven
image,
and
my
molten
image,
hath
commanded
them.
048:006
Thou
hast
heard,
see
all
this;
and
will
not
ye
declare
it?
I
have
shewed
thee
new
things
from
this
time,
even
hidden
things,
and
thou
didst
not
know
them.
048:007
They
are
created
now,
and
not
from
the
beginning;
even
before
the
day
when
thou
heardest
them
not;
lest
thou
shouldest
say,
Behold,
I
knew
them.
048:008
Yea,
thou
heardest
not;
yea,
thou
knewest
not;
yea,
from
that
time
that
thine
ear
was
not
opened:
for
I
knew
that
thou
wouldest
deal
very
treacherously,
and
wast
called
a
transgressor
from
the
womb.
048:009
For
my
name's
sake
will
I
defer
mine
anger,
and
for
my
praise
will
I
refrain
for
thee,
that
I
cut
thee
not
off.
048:010
Behold,
I
have
refined
thee,
but
not
with
silver;
I
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
affliction.
048:011
For
mine
own
sake,
even
for
mine
own
sake,
will
I
do
it:
for
how
should
my
name
be
polluted?
and
I
will
not
give
my
glory
unto
another.
048:012
Hearken
unto
me,
O
Jacob
and
Israel,
my
called;
I
am
he;
I
am
the
first,
I
also
am
the
last.
048:013
Mine
hand
also
hath
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth,
and
my
right
hand
hath
spanned
the
heavens:
when
I
call
unto
them,
they
stand
up
together.
048:014
All
ye,
assemble
yourselves,
and
hear;
which
among
them
hath
declared
these
things?
The
LORD
hath
loved
him:
he
will
do
his
pleasure
on
Babylon,
and
his
arm
shall
be
on
the
Chaldeans.
048:015
I,
even
I,
have
spoken;
yea,
I
have
called
him:
I
have
brought
him,
and
he
shall
make
his
way
prosperous.
048:016
Come
ye
near
unto
me,
hear
ye
this;
I
have
not
spoken
in
secret
from
the
beginning;
from
the
time
that
it
was,
there
am
I:
and
now
the
Lord
GOD,
and
his
Spirit,
hath
sent
me.
048:017
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
thy
Redeemer,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel;
I
am
the
LORD
thy
God
which
teacheth
thee
to
profit,
which
leadeth
thee
by
the
way
that
thou
shouldest
go.
048:018
O
that
thou
hadst
hearkened
to
my
commandments!
then
had
thy
peace
been
as
a
river,
and
thy
righteousness
as
the
waves
of
the
sea:
048:019
Thy
seed
also
had
been
as
the
sand,
and
the
offspring
of
thy
bowels
like
the
gravel
thereof;
his
name
should
not
have
been
cut
off
nor
destroyed
from
before
me.
048:020
Go
ye
forth
of
Babylon,
flee
ye
from
the
Chaldeans,
with
a
voice
of
singing
declare
ye,
tell
this,
utter
it
even
to
the
end
of
the
earth;
say
ye,
The
LORD
hath
redeemed
his
servant
Jacob.
048:021
And
they
thirsted
not
when
he
led
them
through
the
deserts:
he
caused
the
waters
to
flow
out
of
the
rock
for
them:
he
clave
the
rock
also,
and
the
waters
gushed
out.
048:022
There
is
no
peace,
saith
the
LORD,
unto
the
wicked.
049:001
Listen,
O
isles,
unto
me;
and
hearken,
ye
people,
from
far;
The
LORD
hath
called
me
from
the
womb;
from
the
bowels
of
my
mother
hath
he
made
mention
of
my
name.
049:002
And
he
hath
made
my
mouth
like
a
sharp
sword;
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hath
he
hid
me,
and
made
me
a
polished
shaft;
in
his
quiver
hath
he
hid
me;
049:003
And
said
unto
me,
Thou
art
my
servant,
O
Israel,
in
whom
I
will
be
glorified.
049:004
Then
I
said,
I
have
laboured
in
vain,
I
have
spent
my
strength
for
nought,
and
in
vain:
yet
surely
my
judgment
is
with
the
LORD,
and
my
work
with
my
God.
049:005
And
now,
saith
the
LORD
that
formed
me
from
the
womb
to
be
his
servant,
to
bring
Jacob
again
to
him,
Though
Israel
be
not
gathered,
yet
shall
I
be
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
and
my
God
shall
be
my
strength.
049:006
And
he
said,
It
is
a
light
thing
that
thou
shouldest
be
my
servant
to
raise
up
the
tribes
of
Jacob,
and
to
restore
the
preserved
of
Israel:
I
will
also
give
thee
for
a
light
to
the
Gentiles,
that
thou
mayest
be
my
salvation
unto
the
end
of
the
earth.
049:007
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
Redeemer
of
Israel,
and
his
Holy
One,
to
him
whom
man
despiseth,
to
him
whom
the
nation
abhorreth,
to
a
servant
of
rulers,
Kings
shall
see
and
arise,
princes
also
shall
worship,
because
of
the
LORD
that
is
faithful,
and
the
Holy
One
of
Israel,
and
he
shall
choose
thee.
049:008
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
In
an
acceptable
time
have
I
heard
thee,
and
in
a
day
of
salvation
have
