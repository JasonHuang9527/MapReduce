the
head
and
worshipped.
012:028
And
the
children
of
Israel
went
away,
and
did
as
the
LORD
had
commanded
Moses
and
Aaron,
so
did
they.
012:029
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
at
midnight
the
LORD
smote
all
the
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
from
the
firstborn
of
Pharaoh
that
sat
on
his
throne
unto
the
firstborn
of
the
captive
that
was
in
the
dungeon;
and
all
the
firstborn
of
cattle.
012:030
And
Pharaoh
rose
up
in
the
night,
he,
and
all
his
servants,
and
all
the
Egyptians;
and
there
was
a
great
cry
in
Egypt;
for
there
was
not
a
house
where
there
was
not
one
dead.
012:031
And
he
called
for
Moses
and
Aaron
by
night,
and
said,
Rise
up,
and
get
you
forth
from
among
my
people,
both
ye
and
the
children
of
Israel;
and
go,
serve
the
LORD,
as
ye
have
said.
012:032
Also
take
your
flocks
and
your
herds,
as
ye
have
said,
and
be
gone;
and
bless
me
also.
012:033
And
the
Egyptians
were
urgent
upon
the
people,
that
they
might
send
them
out
of
the
land
in
haste;
for
they
said,
We
be
all
dead
men.
012:034
And
the
people
took
their
dough
before
it
was
leavened,
their
kneadingtroughs
being
bound
up
in
their
clothes
upon
their
shoulders.
012:035
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
according
to
the
word
of
Moses;
and
they
borrowed
of
the
Egyptians
jewels
of
silver,
and
jewels
of
gold,
and
raiment:
012:036
And
the
LORD
gave
the
people
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
Egyptians,
so
that
they
lent
unto
them
such
things
as
they
required.
And
they
spoiled
the
Egyptians.
012:037
And
the
children
of
Israel
journeyed
from
Rameses
to
Succoth,
about
six
hundred
thousand
on
foot
that
were
men,
beside
children.
012:038
And
a
mixed
multitude
went
up
also
with
them;
and
flocks,
and
herds,
even
very
much
cattle.
012:039
And
they
baked
unleavened
cakes
of
the
dough
which
they
brought
forth
out
of
Egypt,
for
it
was
not
leavened;
because
they
were
thrust
out
of
Egypt,
and
could
not
tarry,
neither
had
they
prepared
for
themselves
any
victual.
012:040
Now
the
sojourning
of
the
children
of
Israel,
who
dwelt
in
Egypt,
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years.
012:041
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
the
four
hundred
and
thirty
years,
even
the
selfsame
day
it
came
to
pass,
that
all
the
hosts
of
the
LORD
went
out
from
the
land
of
Egypt.
012:042
It
is
a
night
to
be
much
observed
unto
the
LORD
for
bringing
them
out
from
the
land
of
Egypt:
this
is
that
night
of
the
LORD
to
be
observed
of
all
the
children
of
Israel
in
their
generations.
012:043
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses
and
Aaron,
This
is
the
ordinance
of
the
passover:
There
shall
no
stranger
eat
thereof:
012:044
But
every
man's
servant
that
is
bought
for
money,
when
thou
hast
circumcised
him,
then
shall
he
eat
thereof.
012:045
A
foreigner
and
an
hired
servant
shall
not
eat
thereof.
012:046
In
one
house
shall
it
be
eaten;
thou
shalt
not
carry
forth
ought
of
the
flesh
abroad
out
of
the
house;
neither
shall
ye
break
a
bone
thereof.
012:047
All
the
congregation
of
Israel
shall
keep
it.
012:048
And
when
a
stranger
shall
sojourn
with
thee,
and
will
keep
the
passover
to
the
LORD,
let
all
his
males
be
circumcised,
and
then
let
him
come
near
and
keep
it;
and
he
shall
be
as
one
that
is
born
in
the
land:
for
no
uncircumcised
person
shall
eat
thereof.
012:049
One
law
shall
be
to
him
that
is
homeborn,
and
unto
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
you.
012:050
Thus
did
all
the
children
of
Israel;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses
and
Aaron,
so
did
they.
012:051
And
it
came
to
pass
the
selfsame
day,
that
the
LORD
did
bring
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
by
their
armies.
013:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
013:002
Sanctify
unto
me
all
the
firstborn,
whatsoever
openeth
the
womb
among
the
children
of
Israel,
both
of
man
and
of
beast:
it
is
mine.
013:003
And
Moses
said
unto
the
people,
Remember
this
day,
in
which
ye
came
out
from
Egypt,
out
of
the
house
of
bondage;
for
by
strength
of
hand
the
LORD
brought
you
out
from
this
place:
there
shall
no
leavened
bread
be
eaten.
013:004
This
day
came
ye
out
in
the
month
Abib.
013:005
And
it
shall
be
when
the
LORD
shall
bring
thee
into
the
land
of
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Hittites,
and
the
Amorites,
and
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites,
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
give
thee,
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey,
that
thou
shalt
keep
this
service
in
this
month.
013:006
Seven
days
thou
shalt
eat
unleavened
bread,
and
in
the
seventh
day
shall
be
a
feast
to
the
LORD.
013:007
Unleavened
bread
shall
be
eaten
seven
days;
and
there
shall
no
leavened
bread
be
seen
with
thee,
neither
shall
there
be
leaven
seen
with
thee
in
all
thy
quarters.
013:008
And
thou
shalt
shew
thy
son
in
that
day,
saying,
This
is
done
because
of
that
which
the
LORD
did
unto
me
when
I
came
forth
out
of
Egypt.
013:009
And
it
shall
be
for
a
sign
unto
thee
upon
thine
hand,
and
for
a
memorial
between
thine
eyes,
that
the
LORD's
law
may
be
in
thy
mouth:
for
with
a
strong
hand
hath
the
LORD
brought
thee
out
of
Egypt.
013:010
Thou
shalt
therefore
keep
this
ordinance
in
his
season
from
year
to
year.
013:011
And
it
shall
be
when
the
LORD
shall
bring
thee
into
the
land
of
the
Canaanites,
as
he
sware
unto
thee
and
to
thy
fathers,
and
shall
give
it
thee,
013:012
That
thou
shalt
set
apart
unto
the
LORD
all
that
openeth
the
matrix,
and
every
firstling
that
cometh
of
a
beast
which
thou
hast;
the
males
shall
be
the
LORD's.
013:013
And
every
firstling
of
an
ass
thou
shalt
redeem
with
a
lamb;
and
if
thou
wilt
not
redeem
it,
then
thou
shalt
break
his
neck:
and
all
the
firstborn
of
man
among
thy
children
shalt
thou
redeem.
013:014
And
it
shall
be
when
thy
son
asketh
thee
in
time
to
come,
saying,
What
is
this?
that
thou
shalt
say
unto
him,
By
strength
of
hand
the
LORD
brought
us
out
from
Egypt,
from
the
house
of
bondage:
013:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Pharaoh
would
hardly
let
us
go,
that
the
LORD
slew
all
the
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
both
the
firstborn
of
man,
and
the
firstborn
of
beast:
therefore
I
sacrifice
to
the
LORD
all
that
openeth
the
matrix,
being
males;
but
all
the
firstborn
of
my
children
I
redeem.
013:016
And
it
shall
be
for
a
token
upon
thine
hand,
and
for
frontlets
between
thine
eyes:
for
by
strength
of
hand
the
LORD
brought
us
forth
out
of
Egypt.
013:017
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Pharaoh
had
let
the
people
go,
that
God
led
them
not
through
the
way
of
the
land
of
the
Philistines,
although
that
was
near;
for
God
said,
Lest
peradventure
the
people
repent
when
they
see
war,
and
they
return
to
Egypt:
013:018
But
God
led
the
people
about,
through
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
the
Red
sea:
and
the
children
of
Israel
went
up
harnessed
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
013:019
And
Moses
took
the
bones
of
Joseph
with
him:
for
he
had
straitly
sworn
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
God
will
surely
visit
you;
and
ye
shall
carry
up
my
bones
away
hence
with
you.
013:020
And
they
took
their
journey
from
Succoth,
and
encamped
in
Etham,
in
the
edge
of
the
wilderness.
013:021
And
the
LORD
went
before
them
by
day
in
a
pillar
of
a
cloud,
to
lead
them
the
way;
and
by
night
in
a
pillar
of
fire,
to
give
them
light;
to
go
by
day
and
night:
013:022
He
took
not
away
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
by
day,
nor
the
pillar
of
fire
by
night,
from
before
the
people.
014:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
014:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
turn
and
encamp
before
Pihahiroth,
between
Migdol
and
the
sea,
over
against
Baalzephon:
before
it
shall
ye
encamp
by
the
sea.
014:003
For
Pharaoh
will
say
of
the
children
of
Israel,
They
are
entangled
in
the
land,
the
wilderness
hath
shut
them
in.
014:004
And
I
will
harden
Pharaoh's
heart,
that
he
shall
follow
after
them;
and
I
will
be
honoured
upon
Pharaoh,
and
upon
all
his
host;
that
the
Egyptians
may
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
And
they
did
so.
014:005
And
it
was
told
the
king
of
Egypt
that
the
people
fled:
and
the
heart
of
Pharaoh
and
of
his
servants
was
turned
against
the
people,
and
they
said,
Why
have
we
done
this,
that
we
have
let
Israel
go
from
serving
us?
014:006
And
he
made
ready
his
chariot,
and
took
his
people
with
him:
014:007
And
he
took
six
hundred
chosen
chariots,
and
all
the
chariots
of
Egypt,
and
captains
over
every
one
of
them.
014:008
And
the
LORD
hardened
the
heart
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
and
he
pursued
after
the
children
of
Israel:
and
the
children
of
Israel
went
out
with
an
high
hand.
014:009
But
the
Egyptians
pursued
after
them,
all
the
horses
and
chariots
of
Pharaoh,
and
his
horsemen,
and
his
army,
and
overtook
them
encamping
by
the
sea,
beside
Pihahiroth,
before
Baalzephon.
014:010
And
when
Pharaoh
drew
nigh,
the
children
of
Israel
lifted
up
their
eyes,
and,
behold,
the
Egyptians
marched
after
them;
and
they
were
sore
afraid:
and
the
children
of
Israel
cried
out
unto
the
LORD.
014:011
And
they
said
unto
Moses,
Because
there
were
no
graves
in
Egypt,
hast
thou
taken
us
away
to
die
in
the
wilderness?
wherefore
hast
thou
dealt
thus
with
us,
to
carry
us
forth
out
of
Egypt?
014:012
Is
not
this
the
word
that
we
did
tell
thee
in
Egypt,
saying,
Let
us
alone,
that
we
may
serve
the
Egyptians?
For
it
had
been
better
for
us
to
serve
the
Egyptians,
than
that
we
should
die
in
the
wilderness.
014:013
And
Moses
said
unto
the
people,
Fear
ye
not,
stand
still,
and
see
the
salvation
of
the
LORD,
which
he
will
shew
to
you
to
day:
for
the
Egyptians
whom
ye
have
seen
to
day,
ye
shall
see
them
again
no
more
for
ever.
014:014
The
LORD
shall
fight
for
you,
and
ye
shall
hold
your
peace.
014:015
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Wherefore
criest
thou
unto
me?
speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
go
forward:
014:016
But
lift
thou
up
thy
rod,
and
stretch
out
thine
hand
over
the
sea,
and
divide
it:
and
the
children
of
Israel
shall
go
on
dry
ground
through
the
midst
of
the
sea.
014:017
And
I,
behold,
I
will
harden
the
hearts
of
the
Egyptians,
and
they
shall
follow
them:
and
I
will
get
me
honour
upon
Pharaoh,
and
upon
all
his
host,
upon
his
chariots,
and
upon
his
horsemen.
014:018
And
the
Egyptians
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
have
gotten
me
honour
upon
Pharaoh,
upon
his
chariots,
and
upon
his
horsemen.
014:019
And
the
angel
of
God,
which
went
before
the
camp
of
Israel,
removed
and
went
behind
them;
and
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
went
from
before
their
face,
and
stood
behind
them:
014:020
And
it
came
between
the
camp
of
the
Egyptians
and
the
camp
of
Israel;
and
it
was
a
cloud
and
darkness
to
them,
but
it
gave
light
by
night
to
these:
so
that
the
one
came
not
near
the
other
all
the
night.
014:021
And
Moses
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
sea;
and
the
LORD
caused
the
sea
to
go
back
by
a
strong
east
wind
all
that
night,
and
made
the
sea
dry
land,
and
the
waters
were
divided.
014:022
And
the
children
of
Israel
went
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
upon
the
dry
ground:
and
the
waters
were
a
wall
unto
them
on
their
right
hand,
and
on
their
left.
014:023
And
the
Egyptians
pursued,
and
went
in
after
them
to
the
midst
of
the
sea,
even
all
Pharaoh's
horses,
his
chariots,
and
his
horsemen.
014:024
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
in
the
morning
watch
the
LORD
looked
unto
the
host
of
the
Egyptians
through
the
pillar
of
fire
and
of
the
cloud,
and
troubled
the
host
of
the
Egyptians,
014:025
And
took
off
their
chariot
wheels,
that
they
drave
them
heavily:
so
that
the
Egyptians
said,
Let
us
flee
from
the
face
of
Israel;
for
the
LORD
fighteth
for
them
against
the
Egyptians.
014:026
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Stretch
out
thine
hand
over
the
sea,
that
the
waters
may
come
again
upon
the
Egyptians,
upon
their
chariots,
and
upon
their
horsemen.
014:027
And
Moses
stretched
forth
his
hand
over
the
sea,
and
the
sea
returned
to
his
strength
when
the
morning
appeared;
and
the
Egyptians
fled
against
it;
and
the
LORD
overthrew
the
Egyptians
in
the
midst
of
the
sea.
014:028
And
the
waters
returned,
and
covered
the
chariots,
and
the
horsemen,
and
all
the
host
of
Pharaoh
that
came
into
the
sea
after
them;
there
remained
not
so
much
as
one
of
them.
014:029
But
the
children
of
Israel
walked
upon
dry
land
in
the
midst
of
the
sea;
and
the
waters
were
a
wall
unto
them
on
their
right
hand,
and
on
their
left.
014:030
Thus
the
LORD
saved
Israel
that
day
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians;
and
Israel
saw
the
Egyptians
dead
upon
the
sea
shore.
014:031
And
Israel
saw
that
great
work
which
the
LORD
did
upon
the
Egyptians:
and
the
people
feared
the
LORD,
and
believed
the
LORD,
and
his
servant
Moses.
015:001
Then
sang
Moses
and
the
children
of
Israel
this
song
unto
the
LORD,
and
spake,
saying,
I
will
sing
unto
the
LORD,
for
he
hath
triumphed
gloriously:
the
horse
and
his
rider
hath
he
thrown
into
the
sea.
015:002
The
LORD
is
my
strength
and
song,
and
he
is
become
my
salvation:
he
is
my
God,
and
I
will
prepare
him
an
habitation;
my
father's
God,
and
I
will
exalt
him.
015:003
The
LORD
is
a
man
of
war:
the
LORD
is
his
name.
015:004
Pharaoh's
chariots
and
his
host
hath
he
cast
into
the
sea:
his
chosen
captains
also
are
drowned
in
the
Red
sea.
015:005
The
depths
have
covered
them:
they
sank
into
the
bottom
as
a
stone.
015:006
Thy
right
hand,
O
LORD,
is
become
glorious
in
power:
thy
right
hand,
O
LORD,
hath
dashed
in
pieces
the
enemy.
015:007
And
in
the
greatness
of
thine
excellency
thou
hast
overthrown
them
that
rose
up
against
thee:
thou
sentest
forth
thy
wrath,
which
consumed
them
as
stubble.
015:008
And
with
the
blast
of
thy
nostrils
the
waters
were
gathered
together,
the
floods
stood
upright
as
an
heap,
and
the
depths
were
congealed
in
the
heart
of
the
sea.
015:009
The
enemy
said,
I
will
pursue,
I
will
overtake,
I
will
divide
the
spoil;
my
lust
shall
be
satisfied
upon
them;
I
will
draw
my
sword,
my
hand
shall
destroy
them.
015:010
Thou
didst
blow
with
thy
wind,
the
sea
covered
them:
they
sank
as
lead
in
the
mighty
waters.
015:011
Who
is
like
unto
thee,
O
LORD,
among
the
gods?
who
is
like
thee,
glorious
in
holiness,
fearful
in
praises,
doing
wonders?
015:012
Thou
stretchedst
out
thy
right
hand,
the
earth
swallowed
them.
015:013
Thou
in
thy
mercy
hast
led
forth
the
people
which
thou
hast
redeemed:
thou
hast
guided
them
in
thy
strength
unto
thy
holy
habitation.
015:014
The
people
shall
hear,
and
be
afraid:
sorrow
shall
take
hold
on
the
inhabitants
of
Palestina.
015:015
Then
the
dukes
of
Edom
shall
be
amazed;
the
mighty
men
of
Moab,
trembling
shall
take
hold
upon
them;
all
the
inhabitants
of
Canaan
shall
melt
away.
015:016
Fear
and
dread
shall
fall
upon
them;
by
the
greatness
of
thine
arm
they
shall
be
as
still
as
a
stone;
till
thy
people
pass
over,
O
LORD,
till
the
people
pass
over,
which
thou
hast
purchased.
015:017
Thou
shalt
bring
them
in,
and
plant
them
in
the
mountain
of
thine
inheritance,
in
the
place,
O
LORD,
which
thou
hast
made
for
thee
to
dwell
in,
in
the
Sanctuary,
O
LORD,
which
thy
hands
have
established.
015:018
The
LORD
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever.
015:019
For
the
horse
of
Pharaoh
went
in
with
his
chariots
and
with
his
horsemen
into
the
sea,
and
the
LORD
brought
again
the
waters
of
the
sea
upon
them;
but
the
children
of
Israel
went
on
dry
land
in
the
midst
of
the
sea.
015:020
And
Miriam
the
prophetess,
the
sister
of
Aaron,
took
a
timbrel
in
her
hand;
and
all
the
women
went
out
after
her
with
timbrels
and
with
dances.
015:021
And
Miriam
answered
them,
Sing
ye
to
the
LORD,
for
he
hath
triumphed
gloriously;
the
horse
and
his
rider
hath
he
thrown
into
the
sea.
015:022
So
Moses
brought
Israel
from
the
Red
sea,
and
they
went
out
into
the
wilderness
of
Shur;
and
they
went
three
days
in
the
wilderness,
and
found
no
water.
015:023
And
when
they
came
to
Marah,
they
could
not
drink
of
the
waters
of
Marah,
for
they
were
bitter:
therefore
the
name
of
it
was
called
Marah.
015:024
And
the
people
murmured
against
Moses,
saying,
What
shall
we
drink?
015:025
And
he
cried
unto
the
LORD;
and
the
LORD
shewed
him
a
tree,
which
when
he
had
cast
into
the
waters,
the
waters
were
made
sweet:
there
he
made
for
them
a
statute
and
an
ordinance,
and
there
he
proved
them,
015:026
And
said,
If
thou
wilt
diligently
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
wilt
do
that
which
is
right
in
his
sight,
and
wilt
give
ear
to
his
commandments,
and
keep
all
his
statutes,
I
will
put
none
of
these
diseases
upon
thee,
which
I
have
brought
upon
the
Egyptians:
for
I
am
the
LORD
that
healeth
thee.
015:027
And
they
came
to
Elim,
where
were
twelve
wells
of
water,
and
threescore
and
ten
palm
trees:
and
they
encamped
there
by
the
waters.
016:001
And
they
took
their
journey
from
Elim,
and
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
came
unto
the
wilderness
of
Sin,
which
is
between
Elim
and
Sinai,
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
second
month
after
their
departing
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
016:002
And
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
murmured
against
Moses
and
Aaron
in
the
wilderness:
016:003
And
the
children
of
Israel
said
unto
them,
Would
to
God
we
had
died
by
the
hand
of
the
LORD
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
when
we
sat
by
the
flesh
pots,
and
when
we
did
eat
bread
to
the
full;
for
ye
have
brought
us
forth
into
this
wilderness,
to
kill
this
whole
assembly
with
hunger.
016:004
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
Moses,
Behold,
I
will
rain
bread
from
heaven
for
you;
and
the
people
shall
go
out
and
gather
a
certain
rate
every
day,
that
I
may
prove
them,
whether
they
will
walk
in
my
law,
or
no.
016:005
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
on
the
sixth
day
they
shall
prepare
that
which
they
bring
in;
and
it
shall
be
twice
as
much
as
they
gather
daily.
016:006
And
Moses
and
Aaron
said
unto
all
the
children
of
Israel,
At
even,
then
ye
shall
know
that
the
LORD
hath
brought
you
out
from
the
land
of
Egypt:
016:007
And
in
the
morning,
then
ye
shall
see
the
glory
of
the
LORD;
for
that
he
heareth
your
murmurings
against
the
LORD:
and
what
are
we,
that
ye
murmur
against
us?
016:008
And
Moses
said,
This
shall
be,
when
the
LORD
shall
give
you
in
the
evening
flesh
to
eat,
and
in
the
morning
bread
to
the
full;
for
that
the
LORD
heareth
your
murmurings
which
ye
murmur
against
him:
and
what
are
we?
your
murmurings
are
not
against
us,
but
against
the
LORD.
016:009
And
Moses
spake
unto
Aaron,
Say
unto
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
Come
near
before
the
LORD:
for
he
hath
heard
your
murmurings.
016:010
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
Aaron
spake
unto
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
looked
toward
the
wilderness,
and,
behold,
the
glory
of
the
LORD
appeared
in
the
cloud.
016:011
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
016:012
I
have
heard
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
Israel:
speak
unto
them,
saying,
At
even
ye
shall
eat
flesh,
and
in
the
morning
ye
shall
be
filled
with
bread;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
016:013
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
at
even
the
quails
came
up,
and
covered
the
camp:
and
in
the
morning
the
dew
lay
round
about
the
host.
016:014
And
when
the
dew
that
lay
was
gone
up,
behold,
upon
the
face
of
the
wilderness
there
lay
a
small
round
thing,
as
small
as
the
hoar
frost
on
the
ground.
016:015
And
when
the
children
of
Israel
saw
it,
they
said
one
to
another,
It
is
manna:
for
they
wist
not
what
it
was.
And
Moses
said
unto
them,
This
is
the
bread
which
the
LORD
hath
given
you
to
eat.
016:016
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
hath
commanded,
Gather
of
it
every
man
according
to
his
eating,
an
omer
for
every
man,
according
to
the
number
of
your
persons;
take
ye
every
man
for
them
which
are
in
his
tents.
016:017
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
so,
and
gathered,
some
more,
some
less.
016:018
And
when
they
did
mete
it
with
an
omer,
he
that
gathered
much
had
nothing
over,
and
he
that
gathered
little
had
no
lack;
they
gathered
every
man
according
to
his
eating.
016:019
And
Moses
said,
Let
no
man
leave
of
it
till
the
morning.
016:020
Notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
Moses;
but
some
of
them
left
of
it
until
the
morning,
and
it
bred
worms,
and
stank:
and
Moses
was
wroth
with
them.
016:021
And
they
gathered
it
every
morning,
every
man
according
to
his
eating:
and
when
the
sun
waxed
hot,
it
melted.
016:022
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
on
the
sixth
day
they
gathered
twice
as
much
bread,
two
omers
for
one
man:
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
congregation
came
and
told
Moses.
016:023
And
he
said
unto
them,
This
is
that
which
the
LORD
hath
said,
To
morrow
is
the
rest
of
the
holy
sabbath
unto
the
LORD:
bake
that
which
ye
will
bake
to
day,
and
seethe
that
ye
will
seethe;
and
that
which
remaineth
over
lay
up
for
you
to
be
kept
until
the
morning.
016:024
And
they
laid
it
up
till
the
morning,
as
Moses
bade:
and
it
did
not
stink,
neither
was
there
any
worm
therein.
016:025
And
Moses
said,
Eat
that
to
day;
for
to
day
is
a
sabbath
unto
the
LORD:
to
day
ye
shall
not
find
it
in
the
field.
016:026
Six
days
ye
shall
gather
it;
but
on
the
seventh
day,
which
is
the
sabbath,
in
it
there
shall
be
none.
016:027
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
there
went
out
some
of
the
people
on
the
seventh
day
for
to
gather,
and
they
found
none.
016:028
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
How
long
refuse
ye
to
keep
my
commandments
and
my
laws?
016:029
See,
for
that
the
LORD
hath
given
you
the
sabbath,
therefore
he
giveth
you
on
the
sixth
day
the
bread
of
two
days;
abide
ye
every
man
in
his
place,
let
no
man
go
out
of
his
place
on
the
seventh
day.
016:030
So
the
people
rested
on
the
seventh
day.
016:031
And
the
house
of
Israel
called
the
name
thereof
Manna:
and
it
was
like
coriander
seed,
white;
and
the
taste
of
it
was
like
wafers
made
with
honey.
016:032
And
Moses
said,
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
commandeth,
Fill
an
omer
of
it
to
be
kept
for
your
generations;
that
they
may
see
the
bread
wherewith
I
have
fed
you
in
the
wilderness,
when
I
brought
you
forth
from
the
land
of
Egypt.
016:033
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron,
Take
a
pot,
and
put
an
omer
full
of
manna
therein,
and
lay
it
up
before
the
LORD,
to
be
kept
for
your
generations.
016:034
As
the
LORD
