I
helped
thee:
and
I
will
preserve
thee,
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people,
to
establish
the
earth,
to
cause
to
inherit
the
desolate
heritages;
049:009
That
thou
mayest
say
to
the
prisoners,
Go
forth;
to
them
that
are
in
darkness,
Shew
yourselves.
They
shall
feed
in
the
ways,
and
their
pastures
shall
be
in
all
high
places.
049:010
They
shall
not
hunger
nor
thirst;
neither
shall
the
heat
nor
sun
smite
them:
for
he
that
hath
mercy
on
them
shall
lead
them,
even
by
the
springs
of
water
shall
he
guide
them.
049:011
And
I
will
make
all
my
mountains
a
way,
and
my
highways
shall
be
exalted.
049:012
Behold,
these
shall
come
from
far:
and,
lo,
these
from
the
north
and
from
the
west;
and
these
from
the
land
of
Sinim.
049:013
Sing,
O
heavens;
and
be
joyful,
O
earth;
and
break
forth
into
singing,
O
mountains:
for
the
LORD
hath
comforted
his
people,
and
will
have
mercy
upon
his
afflicted.
049:014
But
Zion
said,
The
LORD
hath
forsaken
me,
and
my
Lord
hath
forgotten
me.
049:015
Can
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child,
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb?
yea,
they
may
forget,
yet
will
I
not
forget
thee.
049:016
Behold,
I
have
graven
thee
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands;
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me.
049:017
Thy
children
shall
make
haste;
thy
destroyers
and
they
that
made
thee
waste
shall
go
forth
of
thee.
049:018
Lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about,
and
behold:
all
these
gather
themselves
together,
and
come
to
thee.
As
I
live,
saith
the
LORD,
thou
shalt
surely
clothe
thee
with
them
all,
as
with
an
ornament,
and
bind
them
on
thee,
as
a
bride
doeth.
049:019
For
thy
waste
and
thy
desolate
places,
and
the
land
of
thy
destruction,
shall
even
now
be
too
narrow
by
reason
of
the
inhabitants,
and
they
that
swallowed
thee
up
shall
be
far
away.
049:020
The
children
which
thou
shalt
have,
after
thou
hast
lost
the
other,
shall
say
again
in
thine
ears,
The
place
is
too
strait
for
me:
give
place
to
me
that
I
may
dwell.
049:021
Then
shalt
thou
say
in
thine
heart,
Who
hath
begotten
me
these,
seeing
I
have
lost
my
children,
and
am
desolate,
a
captive,
and
removing
to
and
fro?
and
who
hath
brought
up
these?
Behold,
I
was
left
alone;
these,
where
had
they
been?
049:022
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
Behold,
I
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
Gentiles,
and
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people:
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms,
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders.
049:023
And
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers,
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers:
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
face
toward
the
earth,
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet;
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
LORD:
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me.
049:024
Shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty,
or
the
lawful
captive
delivered?
049:025
But
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away,
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be
delivered:
for
I
will
contend
with
him
that
contendeth
with
thee,
and
I
will
save
thy
children.
049:026
And
I
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
with
their
own
flesh;
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood,
as
with
sweet
wine:
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
I
the
LORD
am
thy
Saviour
and
thy
Redeemer,
the
mighty
One
of
Jacob.
050:001
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Where
is
the
bill
of
your
mother's
divorcement,
whom
I
have
put
away?
or
which
of
my
creditors
is
it
to
whom
I
have
sold
you?
Behold,
for
your
iniquities
have
ye
sold
yourselves,
and
for
your
transgressions
is
your
mother
put
away.
050:002
Wherefore,
when
I
came,
was
there
no
man?
when
I
called,
was
there
none
to
answer?
Is
my
hand
shortened
at
all,
that
it
cannot
redeem?
or
have
I
no
power
to
deliver?
behold,
at
my
rebuke
I
dry
up
the
sea,
I
make
the
rivers
a
wilderness:
their
fish
stinketh,
because
there
is
no
water,
and
dieth
for
thirst.
050:003
I
clothe
the
heavens
with
blackness,
and
I
make
sackcloth
their
covering.
050:004
The
Lord
GOD
hath
given
me
the
tongue
of
the
learned,
that
I
should
know
how
to
speak
a
word
in
season
to
him
that
is
weary:
he
wakeneth
morning
by
morning,
he
wakeneth
mine
ear
to
hear
as
the
learned.
050:005
The
Lord
GOD
hath
opened
mine
ear,
and
I
was
not
rebellious,
neither
turned
away
back.
050:006
I
gave
my
back
to
the
smiters,
and
my
cheeks
to
them
that
plucked
off
the
hair:
I
hid
not
my
face
from
shame
and
spitting.
050:007
For
the
Lord
GOD
will
help
me;
therefore
shall
I
not
be
confounded:
therefore
have
I
set
my
face
like
a
flint,
and
I
know
that
I
shall
not
be
ashamed.
050:008
He
is
near
that
justifieth
me;
who
will
contend
with
me?
let
us
stand
together:
who
is
mine
adversary?
let
him
come
near
to
me.
050:009
Behold,
the
Lord
GOD
will
help
me;
who
is
he
that
shall
condemn
me?
lo,
they
all
shall
wax
old
as
a
garment;
the
moth
shall
eat
them
up.
050:010
Who
is
among
you
that
feareth
the
LORD,
that
obeyeth
the
voice
of
his
servant,
that
walketh
in
darkness,
and
hath
no
light?
let
him
trust
in
the
name
of
the
LORD,
and
stay
upon
his
God.
050:011
Behold,
all
ye
that
kindle
a
fire,
that
compass
yourselves
about
with
sparks:
walk
in
the
light
of
your
fire,
and
in
the
sparks
that
ye
have
kindled.
This
shall
ye
have
of
mine
hand;
ye
shall
lie
down
in
sorrow.
051:001
Hearken
to
me,
ye
that
follow
after
righteousness,
ye
that
seek
the
LORD:
look
unto
the
rock
whence
ye
are
hewn,
and
to
the
hole
of
the
pit
whence
ye
are
digged.
051:002
Look
unto
Abraham
your
father,
and
unto
Sarah
that
bare
you:
for
I
called
him
alone,
and
blessed
him,
and
increased
him.
051:003
For
the
LORD
shall
comfort
Zion:
he
will
comfort
all
her
waste
places;
and
he
will
make
her
wilderness
like
Eden,
and
her
desert
like
the
garden
of
the
LORD;
joy
and
gladness
shall
be
found
therein,
thanksgiving,
and
the
voice
of
melody.
051:004
Hearken
unto
me,
my
people;
and
give
ear
unto
me,
O
my
nation:
for
a
law
shall
proceed
from
me,
and
I
will
make
my
judgment
to
rest
for
a
light
of
the
people.
051:005
My
righteousness
is
near;
my
salvation
is
gone
forth,
and
mine
arms
shall
judge
the
people;
the
isles
shall
wait
upon
me,
and
on
mine
arm
shall
they
trust.
051:006
Lift
up
your
eyes
to
the
heavens,
and
look
upon
the
earth
beneath:
for
the
heavens
shall
vanish
away
like
smoke,
and
the
earth
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment,
and
they
that
dwell
therein
shall
die
in
like
manner:
but
my
salvation
shall
be
for
ever,
and
my
righteousness
shall
not
be
abolished.
051:007
Hearken
unto
me,
ye
that
know
righteousness,
the
people
in
whose
heart
is
my
law;
fear
ye
not
the
reproach
of
men,
neither
be
ye
afraid
of
their
revilings.
051:008
For
the
moth
shall
eat
them
up
like
a
garment,
and
the
worm
shall
eat
them
like
wool:
but
my
righteousness
shall
be
for
ever,
and
my
salvation
from
generation
to
generation.
051:009
Awake,
awake,
put
on
strength,
O
arm
of
the
LORD;
awake,
as
in
the
ancient
days,
in
the
generations
of
old.
Art
thou
not
it
that
hath
cut
Rahab,
and
wounded
the
dragon?
051:010
Art
thou
not
it
which
hath
dried
the
sea,
the
waters
of
the
great
deep;
that
hath
made
the
depths
of
the
sea
a
way
for
the
ransomed
to
pass
over?
051:011
Therefore
the
redeemed
of
the
LORD
shall
return,
and
come
with
singing
unto
Zion;
and
everlasting
joy
shall
be
upon
their
head:
they
shall
obtain
gladness
and
joy;
and
sorrow
and
mourning
shall
flee
away.
051:012
I,
even
I,
am
he
that
comforteth
you:
who
art
thou,
that
thou
shouldest
be
afraid
of
a
man
that
shall
die,
and
of
the
son
of
man
which
shall
be
made
as
grass;
051:013
And
forgettest
the
LORD
thy
maker,
that
hath
stretched
forth
the
heavens,
and
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth;
and
hast
feared
continually
every
day
because
of
the
fury
of
the
oppressor,
as
if
he
were
ready
to
destroy?
and
where
is
the
fury
of
the
oppressor?
051:014
The
captive
exile
hasteneth
that
he
may
be
loosed,
and
that
he
should
not
die
in
the
pit,
nor
that
his
bread
should
fail.
051:015
But
I
am
the
LORD
thy
God,
that
divided
the
sea,
whose
waves
roared:
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
his
name.
051:016
And
I
have
put
my
words
in
thy
mouth,
and
I
have
covered
thee
in
the
shadow
of
mine
hand,
that
I
may
plant
the
heavens,
and
lay
the
foundations
of
the
earth,
and
say
unto
Zion,
Thou
art
my
people.
051:017
Awake,
awake,
stand
up,
O
Jerusalem,
which
hast
drunk
at
the
hand
of
the
LORD
the
cup
of
his
fury;
thou
hast
drunken
the
dregs
of
the
cup
of
trembling,
and
wrung
them
out.
051:018
There
is
none
to
guide
her
among
all
the
sons
whom
she
hath
brought
forth;
neither
is
there
any
that
taketh
her
by
the
hand
of
all
the
sons
that
she
hath
brought
up.
051:019
These
two
things
are
come
unto
thee;
who
shall
be
sorry
for
thee?
desolation,
and
destruction,
and
the
famine,
and
the
sword:
by
whom
shall
I
comfort
thee?
051:020
Thy
sons
have
fainted,
they
lie
at
the
head
of
all
the
streets,
as
a
wild
bull
in
a
net:
they
are
full
of
the
fury
of
the
LORD,
the
rebuke
of
thy
God.
051:021
Therefore
hear
now
this,
thou
afflicted,
and
drunken,
but
not
with
wine:
051:022
Thus
saith
thy
Lord
the
LORD,
and
thy
God
that
pleadeth
the
cause
of
his
people,
Behold,
I
have
taken
out
of
thine
hand
the
cup
of
trembling,
even
the
dregs
of
the
cup
of
my
fury;
thou
shalt
no
more
drink
it
again:
051:023
But
I
will
put
it
into
the
hand
of
them
that
afflict
thee;
which
have
said
to
thy
soul,
Bow
down,
that
we
may
go
over:
and
thou
hast
laid
thy
body
as
the
ground,
and
as
the
street,
to
them
that
went
over.
052:001
Awake,
awake;
put
on
thy
strength,
O
Zion;
put
on
thy
beautiful
garments,
O
Jerusalem,
the
holy
city:
for
henceforth
there
shall
no
more
come
into
thee
the
uncircumcised
and
the
unclean.
052:002
Shake
thyself
from
the
dust;
arise,
and
sit
down,
O
Jerusalem:
loose
thyself
from
the
bands
of
thy
neck,
O
captive
daughter
of
Zion.
052:003
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Ye
have
sold
yourselves
for
nought;
and
ye
shall
be
redeemed
without
money.
052:004
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
My
people
went
down
aforetime
into
Egypt
to
sojourn
there;
and
the
Assyrian
oppressed
them
without
cause.
052:005
Now
therefore,
what
have
I
here,
saith
the
LORD,
that
my
people
is
taken
away
for
nought?
they
that
rule
over
them
make
them
to
howl,
saith
the
LORD;
and
my
name
continually
every
day
is
blasphemed.
052:006
Therefore
my
people
shall
know
my
name:
therefore
they
shall
know
in
that
day
that
I
am
he
that
doth
speak:
behold,
it
is
I.
052:007
How
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings,
that
publisheth
peace;
that
bringeth
good
tidings
of
good,
that
publisheth
salvation;
that
saith
unto
Zion,
Thy
God
reigneth!
052:008
Thy
watchmen
shall
lift
up
the
voice;
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing:
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye,
when
the
LORD
shall
bring
again
Zion.
052:009
Break
forth
into
joy,
sing
together,
ye
waste
places
of
Jerusalem:
for
the
LORD
hath
comforted
his
people,
he
hath
redeemed
Jerusalem.
052:010
The
LORD
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations;
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
our
God.
052:011
Depart
ye,
depart
ye,
go
ye
out
from
thence,
touch
no
unclean
thing;
go
ye
out
of
the
midst
of
her;
be
ye
clean,
that
bear
the
vessels
of
the
LORD.
052:012
For
ye
shall
not
go
out
with
haste,
nor
go
by
flight:
for
the
LORD
will
go
before
you;
and
the
God
of
Israel
will
be
your
rereward.
052:013
Behold,
my
servant
shall
deal
prudently,
he
shall
be
exalted
and
extolled,
and
be
very
high.
052:014
As
many
were
astonied
at
thee;
his
visage
was
so
marred
more
than
any
man,
and
his
form
more
than
the
sons
of
men:
052:015
So
shall
he
sprinkle
many
nations;
the
kings
shall
shut
their
mouths
at
him:
for
that
which
had
not
been
told
them
shall
they
see;
and
that
which
they
had
not
heard
shall
they
consider.
053:001
Who
hath
believed
our
report?
and
to
whom
is
the
arm
of
the
LORD
revealed?
053:002
For
he
shall
grow
up
before
him
as
a
tender
plant,
and
as
a
root
out
of
a
dry
ground:
he
hath
no
form
nor
comeliness;
and
when
we
shall
see
him,
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
him.
053:003
He
is
despised
and
rejected
of
men;
a
man
of
sorrows,
and
acquainted
with
grief:
and
we
hid
as
it
were
our
faces
from
him;
he
was
despised,
and
we
esteemed
him
not.
053:004
Surely
he
hath
borne
our
griefs,
and
carried
our
sorrows:
yet
we
did
esteem
him
stricken,
smitten
of
God,
and
afflicted.
053:005
But
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions,
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities:
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him;
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed.
053:006
All
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray;
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way;
and
the
LORD
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all.
053:007
He
was
oppressed,
and
he
was
afflicted,
yet
he
opened
not
his
mouth:
he
is
brought
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter,
and
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb,
so
he
openeth
not
his
mouth.
053:008
He
was
taken
from
prison
and
from
judgment:
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation?
for
he
was
cut
off
out
of
the
land
of
the
living:
for
the
transgression
of
my
people
was
he
stricken.
053:009
And
he
made
his
grave
with
the
wicked,
and
with
the
rich
in
his
death;
because
he
had
done
no
violence,
neither
was
any
deceit
in
his
mouth.
053:010
Yet
it
pleased
the
LORD
to
bruise
him;
he
hath
put
him
to
grief:
when
thou
shalt
make
his
soul
an
offering
for
sin,
he
shall
see
his
seed,
he
shall
prolong
his
days,
and
the
pleasure
of
the
LORD
shall
prosper
in
his
hand.
053:011
He
shall
see
of
the
travail
of
his
soul,
and
shall
be
satisfied:
by
his
knowledge
shall
my
righteous
servant
justify
many;
for
he
shall
bear
their
iniquities.
053:012
Therefore
will
I
divide
him
a
portion
with
the
great,
and
he
shall
divide
the
spoil
with
the
strong;
because
he
hath
poured
out
his
soul
unto
death:
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors;
and
he
bare
the
sin
of
many,
and
made
intercession
for
the
transgressors.
054:001
Sing,
O
barren,
thou
that
didst
not
bear;
break
forth
into
singing,
and
cry
aloud,
thou
that
didst
not
travail
with
child:
for
more
are
the
children
of
the
desolate
than
the
children
of
the
married
wife,
saith
the
LORD.
054:002
Enlarge
the
place
of
thy
tent,
and
let
them
stretch
forth
the
curtains
of
thine
habitations:
spare
not,
lengthen
thy
cords,
and
strengthen
thy
stakes;
054:003
For
thou
shalt
break
forth
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left;
and
thy
seed
shall
inherit
the
Gentiles,
and
make
the
desolate
cities
to
be
inhabited.
054:004
Fear
not;
for
thou
shalt
not
be
ashamed:
neither
be
thou
confounded;
for
thou
shalt
not
be
put
to
shame:
for
thou
shalt
forget
the
shame
of
thy
youth,
and
shalt
not
remember
the
reproach
of
thy
widowhood
any
more.
054:005
For
thy
Maker
is
thine
husband;
the
LORD
of
hosts
is
his
name;
and
thy
Redeemer
the
Holy
One
of
Israel;
The
God
of
the
whole
earth
shall
he
be
called.
054:006
For
the
LORD
hath
called
thee
as
a
woman
forsaken
and
grieved
in
spirit,
and
a
wife
of
youth,
when
thou
wast
refused,
saith
thy
God.
054:007
For
a
small
moment
have
I
forsaken
thee;
but
with
great
mercies
will
I
gather
thee.
054:008
In
a
little
wrath
I
hid
my
face
from
thee
for
a
moment;
but
with
everlasting
kindness
will
I
have
mercy
on
thee,
saith
the
LORD
thy
Redeemer.
054:009
For
this
is
as
the
waters
of
Noah
unto
me:
for
as
I
have
sworn
that
the
waters
of
Noah
should
no
more
go
over
the
earth;
so
have
I
sworn
that
I
would
not
be
wroth
with
thee,
nor
rebuke
thee.
054:010
For
the
mountains
shall
depart,
and
the
hills
be
removed;
but
my
kindness
shall
not
depart
from
thee,
neither
shall
the
covenant
of
my
peace
be
removed,
saith
the
LORD
that
hath
mercy
on
thee.
054:011
O
thou
afflicted,
tossed
with
tempest,
and
not
comforted,
behold,
I
will
lay
thy
stones
with
fair
colours,
and
lay
thy
foundations
with
sapphires.
054:012
And
I
will
make
thy
windows
of
agates,
and
thy
gates
of
carbuncles,
and
all
thy
borders
of
pleasant
stones.
054:013
And
all
thy
children
shall
be
taught
of
the
LORD;
and
great
shall
be
the
peace
of
thy
children.
054:014
In
righteousness
shalt
thou
be
established:
thou
shalt
be
far
from
oppression;
for
thou
shalt
not
fear:
and
from
terror;
for
it
shall
not
come
near
thee.
054:015
Behold,
they
shall
surely
gather
together,
but
not
by
me:
whosoever
shall
gather
together
against
thee
shall
fall
for
thy
sake.
054:016
Behold,
I
have
created
the
smith
that
bloweth
the
coals
in
the
fire,
and
that
bringeth
forth
an
instrument
for
his
work;
and
I
have
created
the
waster
to
destroy.
054:017
No
weapon
that
is
formed
against
thee
shall
prosper;
and
every
tongue
that
shall
rise
against
thee
in
judgment
thou
shalt
condemn.
This
is
the
heritage
of
the
servants
of
the
LORD,
and
their
righteousness
is
of
me,
saith
the
LORD.
055:001
Ho,
every
one
that
thirsteth,
come
ye
to
the
waters,
and
he
that
hath
no
money;
come
ye,
buy,
and
eat;
yea,
come,
buy
wine
and
milk
without
money
and
without
price.
055:002
Wherefore
do
ye
spend
money
for
that
which
is
not
bread?
and
your
labour
for
that
which
satisfieth
not?
hearken
diligently
unto
me,
and
eat
ye
that
which
is
good,
and
let
your
soul
delight
itself
in
fatness.
055:003
Incline
your
ear,
and
come
unto
me:
hear,
and
your
soul
shall
live;
and
I
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
you,
even
the
sure
mercies
of
David.
055:004
Behold,
I
have
given
him
for
a
witness
to
the
people,
a
leader
and
commander
to
the
people.
055:005
Behold,
thou
shalt
call
a
nation
that
thou
knowest
not,
and
nations
that
knew
not
thee
shall
run
unto
thee
because
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
for
the
Holy
One
of
Israel;
for
he
hath
glorified
thee.
055:006
Seek
ye
the
LORD
while
he
may
be
found,
call
ye
upon
him
while
he
is
near:
055:007
Let
the
wicked
forsake
his
way,
and
the
unrighteous
man
his
thoughts:
and
let
him
return
unto
the
LORD,
and
he
will
have
mercy
upon
him;
and
to
our
God,
for
he
will
abundantly
pardon.
055:008
For
my
thoughts
are
not
your
thoughts,
neither
are
your
ways
my
ways,
saith
the
LORD.
055:009
For
as
the
heavens
are
higher
than
the
earth,
so
are
my
ways
higher
than
your
ways,
and
my
thoughts
than
your
thoughts.
055:010
For
as
the
rain
cometh
down,
and
the
snow
from
heaven,
and
returneth
not
thither,
but
watereth
the
earth,
and
maketh
it
bring
forth
and
bud,
that
it
may
give
seed
to
the
sower,
and
bread
to
the
eater:
055:011
So
shall
my
word
be
that
goeth
forth
out
of
my
mouth:
it
shall
not
return
unto
me
void,
but
it
shall
accomplish
that
which
I
please,
and
it
shall
prosper
in
the
thing
whereto
I
sent
it.
055:012
For
ye
shall
go
out
with
joy,
and
be
led
forth
with
peace:
the
mountains
and
the
hills
shall
break
forth
before
you
into
singing,
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
clap
their
hands.
055:013
Instead
of
the
thorn
shall
come
up
the
fir
tree,
and
instead
of
the
brier
shall
come
up
the
myrtle
tree:
and
it
shall
be
to
the
LORD
for
a
name,
for
an
everlasting
sign
that
shall
not
be
cut
off.
056:001
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Keep
ye
judgment,
and
do
justice:
for
my
salvation
is
near
to
come,
and
my
righteousness
to
be
revealed.
056:002
Blessed
is
the
man
that
doeth
this,
and
the
son
of
man
that
layeth
hold
on
it;
that
keepeth
the
sabbath
from
polluting
it,
and
keepeth
his
hand
from
doing
any
evil.
056:003
Neither
let
the
son
of
the
stranger,
that
hath
joined
himself
to
the
LORD,
speak,
saying,
The
LORD
hath
utterly
separated
me
from
his
people:
neither
let
the
eunuch
say,
Behold,
I
am
a
dry
tree.
056:004
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
unto
the
eunuchs
that
keep
my
sabbaths,
and
choose
the
things
that
please
me,
and
take
hold
of
my
covenant;
056:005
Even
unto
them
will
I
give
in
mine
house
and
within
my
walls
a
place
and
a
name
better
than
of
sons
and
of
daughters:
I
will
give
them
an
everlasting
name,
that
shall
not
be
cut
off.
056:006
Also
the
sons
of
the
stranger,
that
join
themselves
to
the
LORD,
to
serve
him,
and
to
love
the
name
of
the
LORD,
to
be
his
servants,
every
one
that
keepeth
the
sabbath
from
polluting
it,
and
taketh
hold
of
my
covenant;
056:007
Even
them
will
I
bring
to
my
holy
mountain,
and
make
them
joyful
in
my
house
of
prayer:
their
burnt
offerings
and
their
sacrifices
shall
be
accepted
upon
mine
altar;
for
mine
house
shall
be
called
an
house
of
prayer
for
all
people.
056:008
The
Lord
GOD,
which
gathereth
the
outcasts
of
Israel
saith,
Yet
will
I
gather
others
to
him,
beside
those
that
are
gathered
unto
him.
056:009
All
ye
beasts
of
the
field,
come
to
devour,
yea,
all
ye
beasts
in
the
forest.
056:010
His
watchmen
are
blind:
they
are
all
ignorant,
they
are
all
dumb
dogs,
they
cannot
bark;
sleeping,
lying
down,
loving
to
slumber.
056:011
Yea,
they
are
greedy
dogs
which
can
never
have
enough,
and
they
are
shepherds
that
cannot
understand:
they
all
look
to
their
own
way,
every
one
for
his
gain,
from
his
quarter.
056:012
Come
ye,
say
they,
I
will
fetch
wine,
and
we
will
fill
ourselves
with
strong
drink;
and
to
morrow
shall
be
as
this
day,
and
much
more
abundant.
057:001
The
righteous
perisheth,
and
no
man
layeth
it
to
heart:
and
merciful
men
are
taken
away,
none
considering
that
the
righteous
is
taken
away
from
the
evil
to
come.
057:002
He
shall
enter
into
peace:
they
shall
rest
in
their
beds,
each
one
walking
in
his
uprightness.
057:003
But
draw
near
hither,
ye
sons
of
the
sorceress,
the
seed
of
the
adulterer
and
the
whore.
057:004
Against
whom
do
ye
sport
yourselves?
against
whom
make
ye
a
wide
mouth,
and
draw
out
the
tongue?
are
ye
not
children
of
transgression,
a
seed
of
falsehood.
057:005
Enflaming
yourselves
with
idols
under
every
green
tree,
slaying
the
children
in
the
valleys
under
the
clifts
of
the
rocks?
057:006
Among
the
smooth
stones
of
the
stream
is
thy
portion;
they,
they
are
thy
lot:
even
to
them
hast
thou
poured
a
drink
offering,
thou
hast
offered
a
meat
offering.
Should
I
receive
comfort
in
these?
057:007
Upon
a
lofty
and
high
mountain
hast
thou
set
thy
bed:
even
thither
wentest
thou
up
to
offer
sacrifice.
057:008
Behind
the
doors
also
and
the
posts
hast
thou
set
up
thy
remembrance:
for
thou
hast
discovered
thyself
to
another
than
me,
and
art
gone
up;
thou
hast
enlarged
thy
bed,
and
made
thee
a
