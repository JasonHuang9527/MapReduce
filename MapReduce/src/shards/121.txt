covenant
with
them;
thou
lovedst
their
bed
where
thou
sawest
it.
057:009
And
thou
wentest
to
the
king
with
ointment,
and
didst
increase
thy
perfumes,
and
didst
send
thy
messengers
far
off,
and
didst
debase
thyself
even
unto
hell.
057:010
Thou
art
wearied
in
the
greatness
of
thy
way;
yet
saidst
thou
not,
There
is
no
hope:
thou
hast
found
the
life
of
thine
hand;
therefore
thou
wast
not
grieved.
057:011
And
of
whom
hast
thou
been
afraid
or
feared,
that
thou
hast
lied,
and
hast
not
remembered
me,
nor
laid
it
to
thy
heart?
have
not
I
held
my
peace
even
of
old,
and
thou
fearest
me
not?
057:012
I
will
declare
thy
righteousness,
and
thy
works;
for
they
shall
not
profit
thee.
057:013
When
thou
criest,
let
thy
companies
deliver
thee;
but
the
wind
shall
carry
them
all
away;
vanity
shall
take
them:
but
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
me
shall
possess
the
land,
and
shall
inherit
my
holy
mountain;
057:014
And
shall
say,
Cast
ye
up,
cast
ye
up,
prepare
the
way,
take
up
the
stumblingblock
out
of
the
way
of
my
people.
057:015
For
thus
saith
the
high
and
lofty
One
that
inhabiteth
eternity,
whose
name
is
Holy;
I
dwell
in
the
high
and
holy
place,
with
him
also
that
is
of
a
contrite
and
humble
spirit,
to
revive
the
spirit
of
the
humble,
and
to
revive
the
heart
of
the
contrite
ones.
057:016
For
I
will
not
contend
for
ever,
neither
will
I
be
always
wroth:
for
the
spirit
should
fail
before
me,
and
the
souls
which
I
have
made.
057:017
For
the
iniquity
of
his
covetousness
was
I
wroth,
and
smote
him:
I
hid
me,
and
was
wroth,
and
he
went
on
frowardly
in
the
way
of
his
heart.
057:018
I
have
seen
his
ways,
and
will
heal
him:
I
will
lead
him
also,
and
restore
comforts
unto
him
and
to
his
mourners.
057:019
I
create
the
fruit
of
the
lips;
Peace,
peace
to
him
that
is
far
off,
and
to
him
that
is
near,
saith
the
LORD;
and
I
will
heal
him.
057:020
But
the
wicked
are
like
the
troubled
sea,
when
it
cannot
rest,
whose
waters
cast
up
mire
and
dirt.
057:021
There
is
no
peace,
saith
my
God,
to
the
wicked.
058:001
Cry
aloud,
spare
not,
lift
up
thy
voice
like
a
trumpet,
and
shew
my
people
their
transgression,
and
the
house
of
Jacob
their
sins.
058:002
Yet
they
seek
me
daily,
and
delight
to
know
my
ways,
as
a
nation
that
did
righteousness,
and
forsook
not
the
ordinance
of
their
God:
they
ask
of
me
the
ordinances
of
justice;
they
take
delight
in
approaching
to
God.
058:003
Wherefore
have
we
fasted,
say
they,
and
thou
seest
not?
wherefore
have
we
afflicted
our
soul,
and
thou
takest
no
knowledge?
Behold,
in
the
day
of
your
fast
ye
find
pleasure,
and
exact
all
your
labours.
058:004
Behold,
ye
fast
for
strife
and
debate,
and
to
smite
with
the
fist
of
wickedness:
ye
shall
not
fast
as
ye
do
this
day,
to
make
your
voice
to
be
heard
on
high.
058:005
Is
it
such
a
fast
that
I
have
chosen?
a
day
for
a
man
to
afflict
his
soul?
is
it
to
bow
down
his
head
as
a
bulrush,
and
to
spread
sackcloth
and
ashes
under
him?
wilt
thou
call
this
a
fast,
and
an
acceptable
day
to
the
LORD?
058:006
Is
not
this
the
fast
that
I
have
chosen?
to
loose
the
bands
of
wickedness,
to
undo
the
heavy
burdens,
and
to
let
the
oppressed
go
free,
and
that
ye
break
every
yoke?
058:007
Is
it
not
to
deal
thy
bread
to
the
hungry,
and
that
thou
bring
the
poor
that
are
cast
out
to
thy
house?
when
thou
seest
the
naked,
that
thou
cover
him;
and
that
thou
hide
not
thyself
from
thine
own
flesh?
058:008
Then
shall
thy
light
break
forth
as
the
morning,
and
thine
health
shall
spring
forth
speedily:
and
thy
righteousness
shall
go
before
thee;
the
glory
of
the
LORD
shall
be
thy
rereward.
058:009
Then
shalt
thou
call,
and
the
LORD
shall
answer;
thou
shalt
cry,
and
he
shall
say,
Here
I
am.
If
thou
take
away
from
the
midst
of
thee
the
yoke,
the
putting
forth
of
the
finger,
and
speaking
vanity;
058:010
And
if
thou
draw
out
thy
soul
to
the
hungry,
and
satisfy
the
afflicted
soul;
then
shall
thy
light
rise
in
obscurity,
and
thy
darkness
be
as
the
noon
day:
058:011
And
the
LORD
shall
guide
thee
continually,
and
satisfy
thy
soul
in
drought,
and
make
fat
thy
bones:
and
thou
shalt
be
like
a
watered
garden,
and
like
a
spring
of
water,
whose
waters
fail
not.
058:012
And
they
that
shall
be
of
thee
shall
build
the
old
waste
places:
thou
shalt
raise
up
the
foundations
of
many
generations;
and
thou
shalt
be
called,
The
repairer
of
the
breach,
The
restorer
of
paths
to
dwell
in.
058:013
If
thou
turn
away
thy
foot
from
the
sabbath,
from
doing
thy
pleasure
on
my
holy
day;
and
call
the
sabbath
a
delight,
the
holy
of
the
LORD,
honourable;
and
shalt
honour
him,
not
doing
thine
own
ways,
nor
finding
thine
own
pleasure,
nor
speaking
thine
own
words:
058:014
Then
shalt
thou
delight
thyself
in
the
LORD;
and
I
will
cause
thee
to
ride
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth,
and
feed
thee
with
the
heritage
of
Jacob
thy
father:
for
the
mouth
of
the
LORD
hath
spoken
it.
059:001
Behold,
the
LORD's
hand
is
not
shortened,
that
it
cannot
save;
neither
his
ear
heavy,
that
it
cannot
hear:
059:002
But
your
iniquities
have
separated
between
you
and
your
God,
and
your
sins
have
hid
his
face
from
you,
that
he
will
not
hear.
059:003
For
your
hands
are
defiled
with
blood,
and
your
fingers
with
iniquity;
your
lips
have
spoken
lies,
your
tongue
hath
muttered
perverseness.
059:004
None
calleth
for
justice,
nor
any
pleadeth
for
truth:
they
trust
in
vanity,
and
speak
lies;
they
conceive
mischief,
and
bring
forth
iniquity.
059:005
They
hatch
cockatrice'
eggs,
and
weave
the
spider's
web:
he
that
eateth
of
their
eggs
dieth,
and
that
which
is
crushed
breaketh
out
into
a
viper.
059:006
Their
webs
shall
not
become
garments,
neither
shall
they
cover
themselves
with
their
works:
their
works
are
works
of
iniquity,
and
the
act
of
violence
is
in
their
hands.
059:007
Their
feet
run
to
evil,
and
they
make
haste
to
shed
innocent
blood:
their
thoughts
are
thoughts
of
iniquity;
wasting
and
destruction
are
in
their
paths.
059:008
The
way
of
peace
they
know
not;
and
there
is
no
judgment
in
their
goings:
they
have
made
them
crooked
paths:
whosoever
goeth
therein
shall
not
know
peace.
059:009
Therefore
is
judgment
far
from
us,
neither
doth
justice
overtake
us:
we
wait
for
light,
but
behold
obscurity;
for
brightness,
but
we
walk
in
darkness.
059:010
We
grope
for
the
wall
like
the
blind,
and
we
grope
as
if
we
had
no
eyes:
we
stumble
at
noon
day
as
in
the
night;
we
are
in
desolate
places
as
dead
men.
059:011
We
roar
all
like
bears,
and
mourn
sore
like
doves:
we
look
for
judgment,
but
there
is
none;
for
salvation,
but
it
is
far
off
from
us.
059:012
For
our
transgressions
are
multiplied
before
thee,
and
our
sins
testify
against
us:
for
our
transgressions
are
with
us;
and
as
for
our
iniquities,
we
know
them;
059:013
In
transgressing
and
lying
against
the
LORD,
and
departing
away
from
our
God,
speaking
oppression
and
revolt,
conceiving
and
uttering
from
the
heart
words
of
falsehood.
059:014
And
judgment
is
turned
away
backward,
and
justice
standeth
afar
off:
for
truth
is
fallen
in
the
street,
and
equity
cannot
enter.
059:015
Yea,
truth
faileth;
and
he
that
departeth
from
evil
maketh
himself
a
prey:
and
the
LORD
saw
it,
and
it
displeased
him
that
there
was
no
judgment.
059:016
And
he
saw
that
there
was
no
man,
and
wondered
that
there
was
no
intercessor:
therefore
his
arm
brought
salvation
unto
him;
and
his
righteousness,
it
sustained
him.
059:017
For
he
put
on
righteousness
as
a
breastplate,
and
an
helmet
of
salvation
upon
his
head;
and
he
put
on
the
garments
of
vengeance
for
clothing,
and
was
clad
with
zeal
as
a
cloak.
059:018
According
to
their
deeds,
accordingly
he
will
repay,
fury
to
his
adversaries,
recompence
to
his
enemies;
to
the
islands
he
will
repay
recompence.
059:019
So
shall
they
fear
the
name
of
the
LORD
from
the
west,
and
his
glory
from
the
rising
of
the
sun.
When
the
enemy
shall
come
in
like
a
flood,
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
shall
lift
up
a
standard
against
him.
059:020
And
the
Redeemer
shall
come
to
Zion,
and
unto
them
that
turn
from
transgression
in
Jacob,
saith
the
LORD.
059:021
As
for
me,
this
is
my
covenant
with
them,
saith
the
LORD;
My
spirit
that
is
upon
thee,
and
my
words
which
I
have
put
in
thy
mouth,
shall
not
depart
out
of
thy
mouth,
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed,
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed's
seed,
saith
the
LORD,
from
henceforth
and
for
ever.
060:001
Arise,
shine;
for
thy
light
is
come,
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
is
risen
upon
thee.
060:002
For,
behold,
the
darkness
shall
cover
the
earth,
and
gross
darkness
the
people:
but
the
LORD
shall
arise
upon
thee,
and
his
glory
shall
be
seen
upon
thee.
060:003
And
the
Gentiles
shall
come
to
thy
light,
and
kings
to
the
brightness
of
thy
rising.
060:004
Lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about,
and
see:
all
they
gather
themselves
together,
they
come
to
thee:
thy
sons
shall
come
from
far,
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
nursed
at
thy
side.
060:005
Then
thou
shalt
see,
and
flow
together,
and
thine
heart
shall
fear,
and
be
enlarged;
because
the
abundance
of
the
sea
shall
be
converted
unto
thee,
the
forces
of
the
Gentiles
shall
come
unto
thee.
060:006
The
multitude
of
camels
shall
cover
thee,
the
dromedaries
of
Midian
and
Ephah;
all
they
from
Sheba
shall
come:
they
shall
bring
gold
and
incense;
and
they
shall
shew
forth
the
praises
of
the
LORD.
060:007
All
the
flocks
of
Kedar
shall
be
gathered
together
unto
thee,
the
rams
of
Nebaioth
shall
minister
unto
thee:
they
shall
come
up
with
acceptance
on
mine
altar,
and
I
will
glorify
the
house
of
my
glory.
060:008
Who
are
these
that
fly
as
a
cloud,
and
as
the
doves
to
their
windows?
060:009
Surely
the
isles
shall
wait
for
me,
and
the
ships
of
Tarshish
first,
to
bring
thy
sons
from
far,
their
silver
and
their
gold
with
them,
unto
the
name
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
to
the
Holy
One
of
Israel,
because
he
hath
glorified
thee.
060:010
And
the
sons
of
strangers
shall
build
up
thy
walls,
and
their
kings
shall
minister
unto
thee:
for
in
my
wrath
I
smote
thee,
but
in
my
favour
have
I
had
mercy
on
thee.
060:011
Therefore
thy
gates
shall
be
open
continually;
they
shall
not
be
shut
day
nor
night;
that
men
may
bring
unto
thee
the
forces
of
the
Gentiles,
and
that
their
kings
may
be
brought.
060:012
For
the
nation
and
kingdom
that
will
not
serve
thee
shall
perish;
yea,
those
nations
shall
be
utterly
wasted.
060:013
The
glory
of
Lebanon
shall
come
unto
thee,
the
fir
tree,
the
pine
tree,
and
the
box
together,
to
beautify
the
place
of
my
sanctuary;
and
I
will
make
the
place
of
my
feet
glorious.
060:014
The
sons
also
of
them
that
afflicted
thee
shall
come
bending
unto
thee;
and
all
they
that
despised
thee
shall
bow
themselves
down
at
the
soles
of
thy
feet;
and
they
shall
call
thee;
The
city
of
the
LORD,
The
Zion
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
060:015
Whereas
thou
has
been
forsaken
and
hated,
so
that
no
man
went
through
thee,
I
will
make
thee
an
eternal
excellency,
a
joy
of
many
generations.
060:016
Thou
shalt
also
suck
the
milk
of
the
Gentiles,
and
shalt
suck
the
breast
of
kings:
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
the
LORD
am
thy
Saviour
and
thy
Redeemer,
the
mighty
One
of
Jacob.
060:017
For
brass
I
will
bring
gold,
and
for
iron
I
will
bring
silver,
and
for
wood
brass,
and
for
stones
iron:
I
will
also
make
thy
officers
peace,
and
thine
exactors
righteousness.
060:018
Violence
shall
no
more
be
heard
in
thy
land,
wasting
nor
destruction
within
thy
borders;
but
thou
shalt
call
thy
walls
Salvation,
and
thy
gates
Praise.
060:019
The
sun
shall
be
no
more
thy
light
by
day;
neither
for
brightness
shall
the
moon
give
light
unto
thee:
but
the
LORD
shall
be
unto
thee
an
everlasting
light,
and
thy
God
thy
glory.
060:020
Thy
sun
shall
no
more
go
down;
neither
shall
thy
moon
withdraw
itself:
for
the
LORD
shall
be
thine
everlasting
light,
and
the
days
of
thy
mourning
shall
be
ended.
060:021
Thy
people
also
shall
be
all
righteous:
they
shall
inherit
the
land
for
ever,
the
branch
of
my
planting,
the
work
of
my
hands,
that
I
may
be
glorified.
060:022
A
little
one
shall
become
a
thousand,
and
a
small
one
a
strong
nation:
I
the
LORD
will
hasten
it
in
his
time.
061:001
The
Spirit
of
the
Lord
GOD
is
upon
me;
because
the
LORD
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek;
he
hath
sent
me
to
bind
up
the
brokenhearted,
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captives,
and
the
opening
of
the
prison
to
them
that
are
bound;
061:002
To
proclaim
the
acceptable
year
of
the
LORD,
and
the
day
of
vengeance
of
our
God;
to
comfort
all
that
mourn;
061:003
To
appoint
unto
them
that
mourn
in
Zion,
to
give
unto
them
beauty
for
ashes,
the
oil
of
joy
for
mourning,
the
garment
of
praise
for
the
spirit
of
heaviness;
that
they
might
be
called
trees
of
righteousness,
the
planting
of
the
LORD,
that
he
might
be
glorified.
061:004
And
they
shall
build
the
old
wastes,
they
shall
raise
up
the
former
desolations,
and
they
shall
repair
the
waste
cities,
the
desolations
of
many
generations.
061:005
And
strangers
shall
stand
and
feed
your
flocks,
and
the
sons
of
the
alien
shall
be
your
plowmen
and
your
vinedressers.
061:006
But
ye
shall
be
named
the
Priests
of
the
LORD:
men
shall
call
you
the
Ministers
of
our
God:
ye
shall
eat
the
riches
of
the
Gentiles,
and
in
their
glory
shall
ye
boast
yourselves.
061:007
For
your
shame
ye
shall
have
double;
and
for
confusion
they
shall
rejoice
in
their
portion:
therefore
in
their
land
they
shall
possess
the
double:
everlasting
joy
shall
be
unto
them.
061:008
For
I
the
LORD
love
judgment,
I
hate
robbery
for
burnt
offering;
and
I
will
direct
their
work
in
truth,
and
I
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
them.
061:009
And
their
seed
shall
be
known
among
the
Gentiles,
and
their
offspring
among
the
people:
all
that
see
them
shall
acknowledge
them,
that
they
are
the
seed
which
the
LORD
hath
blessed.
061:010
I
will
greatly
rejoice
in
the
LORD,
my
soul
shall
be
joyful
in
my
God;
for
he
hath
clothed
me
with
the
garments
of
salvation,
he
hath
covered
me
with
the
robe
of
righteousness,
as
a
bridegroom
decketh
himself
with
ornaments,
and
as
a
bride
adorneth
herself
with
her
jewels.
061:011
For
as
the
earth
bringeth
forth
her
bud,
and
as
the
garden
causeth
the
things
that
are
sown
in
it
to
spring
forth;
so
the
Lord
GOD
will
cause
righteousness
and
praise
to
spring
forth
before
all
the
nations.
062:001
For
Zion's
sake
will
I
not
hold
my
peace,
and
for
Jerusalem's
sake
I
will
not
rest,
until
the
righteousness
thereof
go
forth
as
brightness,
and
the
salvation
thereof
as
a
lamp
that
burneth.
062:002
And
the
Gentiles
shall
see
thy
righteousness,
and
all
kings
thy
glory:
and
thou
shalt
be
called
by
a
new
name,
which
the
mouth
of
the
LORD
shall
name.
062:003
Thou
shalt
also
be
a
crown
of
glory
in
the
hand
of
the
LORD,
and
a
royal
diadem
in
the
hand
of
thy
God.
062:004
Thou
shalt
no
more
be
termed
Forsaken;
neither
shall
thy
land
any
more
be
termed
Desolate:
but
thou
shalt
be
called
Hephzibah,
and
thy
land
Beulah:
for
the
LORD
delighteth
in
thee,
and
thy
land
shall
be
married.
062:005
For
as
a
young
man
marrieth
a
virgin,
so
shall
thy
sons
marry
thee:
and
as
the
bridegroom
rejoiceth
over
the
bride,
so
shall
thy
God
rejoice
over
thee.
062:006
I
have
set
watchmen
upon
thy
walls,
O
Jerusalem,
which
shall
never
hold
their
peace
day
nor
night:
ye
that
make
mention
of
the
LORD,
keep
not
silence,
062:007
And
give
him
no
rest,
till
he
establish,
and
till
he
make
Jerusalem
a
praise
in
the
earth.
062:008
The
LORD
hath
sworn
by
his
right
hand,
and
by
the
arm
of
his
strength,
Surely
I
will
no
more
give
thy
corn
to
be
meat
for
thine
enemies;
and
the
sons
of
the
stranger
shall
not
drink
thy
wine,
for
the
which
thou
hast
laboured:
062:009
But
they
that
have
gathered
it
shall
eat
it,
and
praise
the
LORD;
and
they
that
have
brought
it
together
shall
drink
it
in
the
courts
of
my
holiness.
062:010
Go
through,
go
through
the
gates;
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
people;
cast
up,
cast
up
the
highway;
gather
out
the
stones;
lift
up
a
standard
for
the
people.
062:011
Behold,
the
LORD
hath
proclaimed
unto
the
end
of
the
world,
Say
ye
to
the
daughter
of
Zion,
Behold,
thy
salvation
cometh;
behold,
his
reward
is
with
him,
and
his
work
before
him.
062:012
And
they
shall
call
them,
The
holy
people,
The
redeemed
of
the
LORD:
and
thou
shalt
be
called,
Sought
out,
A
city
not
forsaken.
063:001
Who
is
this
that
cometh
from
Edom,
with
dyed
garments
from
Bozrah?
this
that
is
glorious
in
his
apparel,
travelling
in
the
greatness
of
his
strength?
I
that
speak
in
righteousness,
mighty
to
save.
063:002
Wherefore
art
thou
red
in
thine
apparel,
and
thy
garments
like
him
that
treadeth
in
the
winefat?
063:003
I
have
trodden
the
winepress
alone;
and
of
the
people
there
was
none
with
me:
for
I
will
tread
them
in
mine
anger,
and
trample
them
in
my
fury;
and
their
blood
shall
be
sprinkled
upon
my
garments,
and
I
will
stain
all
my
raiment.
063:004
For
the
day
of
vengeance
is
in
mine
heart,
and
the
year
of
my
redeemed
is
come.
063:005
And
I
looked,
and
there
was
none
to
help;
and
I
wondered
that
there
was
none
to
uphold:
therefore
mine
own
arm
brought
salvation
unto
me;
and
my
fury,
it
upheld
me.
063:006
And
I
will
tread
down
the
people
in
mine
anger,
and
make
them
drunk
in
my
fury,
and
I
will
bring
down
their
strength
to
the
earth.
063:007
I
will
mention
the
lovingkindnesses
of
the
LORD,
and
the
praises
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
hath
bestowed
on
us,
and
the
great
goodness
toward
the
house
of
Israel,
which
he
hath
bestowed
on
them
according
to
his
mercies,
and
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
lovingkindnesses.
063:008
For
he
said,
Surely
they
are
my
people,
children
that
will
not
lie:
so
he
was
their
Saviour.
063:009
In
all
their
affliction
he
was
afflicted,
and
the
angel
of
his
presence
saved
them:
in
his
love
and
in
his
pity
he
redeemed
them;
and
he
bare
them,
and
carried
them
all
the
days
of
old.
063:010
But
they
rebelled,
and
vexed
his
holy
Spirit:
therefore
he
was
turned
to
be
their
enemy,
and
he
fought
against
them.
063:011
Then
he
remembered
the
days
of
old,
Moses,
and
his
people,
saying,
Where
is
he
that
brought
them
up
out
of
the
sea
with
the
shepherd
of
his
flock?
where
is
he
that
put
his
holy
Spirit
within
him?
063:012
That
led
them
by
the
right
hand
of
Moses
with
his
glorious
arm,
dividing
the
water
before
them,
to
make
himself
an
everlasting
name?
063:013
That
led
them
through
the
deep,
as
an
horse
in
the
wilderness,
that
they
should
not
stumble?
063:014
As
a
beast
goeth
down
into
the
valley,
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
caused
him
to
rest:
so
didst
thou
lead
thy
people,
to
make
thyself
a
glorious
name.
063:015
Look
down
from
heaven,
and
behold
from
the
habitation
of
thy
holiness
and
of
thy
glory:
where
is
thy
zeal
and
thy
strength,
the
sounding
of
thy
bowels
and
of
thy
mercies
toward
me?
are
they
restrained?
063:016
Doubtless
thou
art
our
father,
though
Abraham
be
ignorant
of
us,
and
Israel
acknowledge
us
not:
thou,
O
LORD,
art
our
father,
our
redeemer;
thy
name
is
from
everlasting.
063:017
O
LORD,
why
hast
thou
made
us
to
err
from
thy
ways,
and
hardened
our
heart
from
thy
fear?
Return
for
thy
servants'
sake,
the
tribes
of
thine
inheritance.
063:018
The
people
of
thy
holiness
have
possessed
it
but
a
little
while:
our
adversaries
have
trodden
down
thy
sanctuary.
063:019
We
are
thine:
thou
never
barest
rule
over
them;
they
were
not
called
by
thy
name.
064:001
Oh
that
thou
wouldest
rend
the
heavens,
that
thou
wouldest
come
down,
that
the
mountains
might
flow
down
at
thy
presence,
064:002
As
when
the
melting
fire
burneth,
the
fire
causeth
the
waters
to
boil,
to
make
thy
name
known
to
thine
adversaries,
that
the
nations
may
tremble
at
thy
presence!
064:003
When
thou
didst
terrible
things
which
we
looked
not
for,
thou
camest
down,
the
mountains
flowed
down
at
thy
presence.
064:004
For
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
men
have
not
heard,
nor
perceived
by
the
ear,
neither
hath
the
eye
seen,
O
God,
beside
thee,
what
he
hath
prepared
for
him
that
waiteth
for
him.
064:005
Thou
meetest
him
that
rejoiceth
and
worketh
righteousness,
those
that
remember
thee
in
thy
ways:
behold,
thou
art
wroth;
for
we
have
sinned:
in
those
is
continuance,
and
we
shall
be
saved.
064:006
But
we
are
all
as
an
unclean
thing,
and
all
our
righteousnesses
are
as
filthy
rags;
and
we
all
do
fade
as
a
leaf;
and
our
iniquities,
like
the
wind,
have
taken
us
away.
064:007
And
there
is
none
that
calleth
upon
thy
name,
that
stirreth
up
himself
to
take
hold
of
thee:
for
thou
hast
hid
thy
face
from
us,
and
hast
consumed
us,
because
of
our
iniquities.
064:008
But
now,
O
LORD,
thou
art
our
father;
we
are
the
clay,
and
thou
our
potter;
and
we
all
are
the
work
of
thy
hand.
064:009
Be
not
wroth
very
sore,
O
LORD,
neither
remember
iniquity
for
ever:
behold,
see,
we
beseech
thee,
we
are
all
thy
people.
064:010
Thy
holy
cities
are
a
wilderness,
Zion
is
a
wilderness,
Jerusalem
a
desolation.
064:011
Our
holy
and
our
beautiful
house,
where
our
fathers
praised
thee,
is
burned
up
with
fire:
and
all
our
pleasant
things
are
laid
waste.
064:012
Wilt
thou
refrain
thyself
for
these
things,
O
LORD?
wilt
thou
hold
thy
peace,
and
afflict
us
very
sore?
065:001
I
am
sought
of
them
that
asked
not
for
me;
I
am
found
of
them
that
sought
me
not:
I
said,
Behold
me,
behold
me,
unto
a
nation
that
was
not
called
by
my
name.
065:002
I
have
spread
out
my
hands
all
the
day
unto
a
rebellious
people,
which
walketh
in
a
way
that
was
not
good,
after
their
own
thoughts;
065:003
A
people
that
provoketh
me
to
anger
continually
to
my
face;
that
sacrificeth
in
gardens,
and
burneth
incense
upon
altars
of
brick;
065:004
Which
remain
among
the
graves,
and
lodge
in
the
monuments,
which
eat
swine's
flesh,
and
broth
of
abominable
things
is
in
their
vessels;
065:005
Which
say,
Stand
by
thyself,
come
not
near
to
me;
for
I
am
holier
than
thou.
These
are
a
smoke
in
my
nose,
a
fire
that
burneth
all
the
day.
065:006
Behold,
it
is
written
before
me:
I
will
not
keep
silence,
but
will
recompense,
even
recompense
into
their
bosom,
065:007
Your
iniquities,
and
the
iniquities
of
your
fathers
together,
saith
the
LORD,
which
have
burned
incense
upon
the
mountains,
and
blasphemed
me
upon
the
hills:
therefore
will
I
measure
their
former
work
into
their
bosom.
065:008
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
As
the
new
wine
is
found
in
the
cluster,
and
one
saith,
Destroy
it
not;
for
a
blessing
is
in
it:
so
will
I
do
for
my
servants'
sakes,
that
I
may
not
destroy
them
all.
