065:009
And
I
will
bring
forth
a
seed
out
of
Jacob,
and
out
of
Judah
an
inheritor
of
my
mountains:
and
mine
elect
shall
inherit
it,
and
my
servants
shall
dwell
there.
065:010
And
Sharon
shall
be
a
fold
of
flocks,
and
the
valley
of
Achor
a
place
for
the
herds
to
lie
down
in,
for
my
people
that
have
sought
me.
065:011
But
ye
are
they
that
forsake
the
LORD,
that
forget
my
holy
mountain,
that
prepare
a
table
for
that
troop,
and
that
furnish
the
drink
offering
unto
that
number.
065:012
Therefore
will
I
number
you
to
the
sword,
and
ye
shall
all
bow
down
to
the
slaughter:
because
when
I
called,
ye
did
not
answer;
when
I
spake,
ye
did
not
hear;
but
did
evil
before
mine
eyes,
and
did
choose
that
wherein
I
delighted
not.
065:013
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
Behold,
my
servants
shall
eat,
but
ye
shall
be
hungry:
behold,
my
servants
shall
drink,
but
ye
shall
be
thirsty:
behold,
my
servants
shall
rejoice,
but
ye
shall
be
ashamed:
065:014
Behold,
my
servants
shall
sing
for
joy
of
heart,
but
ye
shall
cry
for
sorrow
of
heart,
and
shall
howl
for
vexation
of
spirit.
065:015
And
ye
shall
leave
your
name
for
a
curse
unto
my
chosen:
for
the
Lord
GOD
shall
slay
thee,
and
call
his
servants
by
another
name:
065:016
That
he
who
blesseth
himself
in
the
earth
shall
bless
himself
in
the
God
of
truth;
and
he
that
sweareth
in
the
earth
shall
swear
by
the
God
of
truth;
because
the
former
troubles
are
forgotten,
and
because
they
are
hid
from
mine
eyes.
065:017
For,
behold,
I
create
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth:
and
the
former
shall
not
be
remembered,
nor
come
into
mind.
065:018
But
be
ye
glad
and
rejoice
for
ever
in
that
which
I
create:
for,
behold,
I
create
Jerusalem
a
rejoicing,
and
her
people
a
joy.
065:019
And
I
will
rejoice
in
Jerusalem,
and
joy
in
my
people:
and
the
voice
of
weeping
shall
be
no
more
heard
in
her,
nor
the
voice
of
crying.
065:020
There
shall
be
no
more
thence
an
infant
of
days,
nor
an
old
man
that
hath
not
filled
his
days:
for
the
child
shall
die
an
hundred
years
old;
but
the
sinner
being
an
hundred
years
old
shall
be
accursed.
065:021
And
they
shall
build
houses,
and
inhabit
them;
and
they
shall
plant
vineyards,
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them.
065:022
They
shall
not
build,
and
another
inhabit;
they
shall
not
plant,
and
another
eat:
for
as
the
days
of
a
tree
are
the
days
of
my
people,
and
mine
elect
shall
long
enjoy
the
work
of
their
hands.
065:023
They
shall
not
labour
in
vain,
nor
bring
forth
for
trouble;
for
they
are
the
seed
of
the
blessed
of
the
LORD,
and
their
offspring
with
them.
065:024
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
before
they
call,
I
will
answer;
and
while
they
are
yet
speaking,
I
will
hear.
065:025
The
wolf
and
the
lamb
shall
feed
together,
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
bullock:
and
dust
shall
be
the
serpent's
meat.
They
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain,
saith
the
LORD.
066:001
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
The
heaven
is
my
throne,
and
the
earth
is
my
footstool:
where
is
the
house
that
ye
build
unto
me?
and
where
is
the
place
of
my
rest?
066:002
For
all
those
things
hath
mine
hand
made,
and
all
those
things
have
been,
saith
the
LORD:
but
to
this
man
will
I
look,
even
to
him
that
is
poor
and
of
a
contrite
spirit,
and
trembleth
at
my
word.
066:003
He
that
killeth
an
ox
is
as
if
he
slew
a
man;
he
that
sacrificeth
a
lamb,
as
if
he
cut
off
a
dog's
neck;
he
that
offereth
an
oblation,
as
if
he
offered
swine's
blood;
he
that
burneth
incense,
as
if
he
blessed
an
idol.
Yea,
they
have
chosen
their
own
ways,
and
their
soul
delighteth
in
their
abominations.
066:004
I
also
will
choose
their
delusions,
and
will
bring
their
fears
upon
them;
because
when
I
called,
none
did
answer;
when
I
spake,
they
did
not
hear:
but
they
did
evil
before
mine
eyes,
and
chose
that
in
which
I
delighted
not.
066:005
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
ye
that
tremble
at
his
word;
Your
brethren
that
hated
you,
that
cast
you
out
for
my
name's
sake,
said,
Let
the
LORD
be
glorified:
but
he
shall
appear
to
your
joy,
and
they
shall
be
ashamed.
066:006
A
voice
of
noise
from
the
city,
a
voice
from
the
temple,
a
voice
of
the
LORD
that
rendereth
recompence
to
his
enemies.
066:007
Before
she
travailed,
she
brought
forth;
before
her
pain
came,
she
was
delivered
of
a
man
child.
066:008
Who
hath
heard
such
a
thing?
who
hath
seen
such
things?
Shall
the
earth
be
made
to
bring
forth
in
one
day?
or
shall
a
nation
be
born
at
once?
for
as
soon
as
Zion
travailed,
she
brought
forth
her
children.
066:009
Shall
I
bring
to
the
birth,
and
not
cause
to
bring
forth?
saith
the
LORD:
shall
I
cause
to
bring
forth,
and
shut
the
womb?
saith
thy
God.
066:010
Rejoice
ye
with
Jerusalem,
and
be
glad
with
her,
all
ye
that
love
her:
rejoice
for
joy
with
her,
all
ye
that
mourn
for
her:
066:011
That
ye
may
suck,
and
be
satisfied
with
the
breasts
of
her
consolations;
that
ye
may
milk
out,
and
be
delighted
with
the
abundance
of
her
glory.
066:012
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
extend
peace
to
her
like
a
river,
and
the
glory
of
the
Gentiles
like
a
flowing
stream:
then
shall
ye
suck,
ye
shall
be
borne
upon
her
sides,
and
be
dandled
upon
her
knees.
066:013
As
one
whom
his
mother
comforteth,
so
will
I
comfort
you;
and
ye
shall
be
comforted
in
Jerusalem.
066:014
And
when
ye
see
this,
your
heart
shall
rejoice,
and
your
bones
shall
flourish
like
an
herb:
and
the
hand
of
the
LORD
shall
be
known
toward
his
servants,
and
his
indignation
toward
his
enemies.
066:015
For,
behold,
the
LORD
will
come
with
fire,
and
with
his
chariots
like
a
whirlwind,
to
render
his
anger
with
fury,
and
his
rebuke
with
flames
of
fire.
066:016
For
by
fire
and
by
his
sword
will
the
LORD
plead
with
all
flesh:
and
the
slain
of
the
LORD
shall
be
many.
066:017
They
that
sanctify
themselves,
and
purify
themselves
in
the
gardens
behind
one
tree
in
the
midst,
eating
swine's
flesh,
and
the
abomination,
and
the
mouse,
shall
be
consumed
together,
saith
the
LORD.
066:018
For
I
know
their
works
and
their
thoughts:
it
shall
come,
that
I
will
gather
all
nations
and
tongues;
and
they
shall
come,
and
see
my
glory.
066:019
And
I
will
set
a
sign
among
them,
and
I
will
send
those
that
escape
of
them
unto
the
nations,
to
Tarshish,
Pul,
and
Lud,
that
draw
the
bow,
to
Tubal,
and
Javan,
to
the
isles
afar
off,
that
have
not
heard
my
fame,
neither
have
seen
my
glory;
and
they
shall
declare
my
glory
among
the
Gentiles.
066:020
And
they
shall
bring
all
your
brethren
for
an
offering
unto
the
LORD
out
of
all
nations
upon
horses,
and
in
chariots,
and
in
litters,
and
upon
mules,
and
upon
swift
beasts,
to
my
holy
mountain
Jerusalem,
saith
the
LORD,
as
the
children
of
Israel
bring
an
offering
in
a
clean
vessel
into
the
house
of
the
LORD.
066:021
And
I
will
also
take
of
them
for
priests
and
for
Levites,
saith
the
LORD.
066:022
For
as
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth,
which
I
will
make,
shall
remain
before
me,
saith
the
LORD,
so
shall
your
seed
and
your
name
remain.
066:023
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
from
one
new
moon
to
another,
and
from
one
sabbath
to
another,
shall
all
flesh
come
to
worship
before
me,
saith
the
LORD.
066:024
And
they
shall
go
forth,
and
look
upon
the
carcases
of
the
men
that
have
transgressed
against
me:
for
their
worm
shall
not
die,
neither
shall
their
fire
be
quenched;
and
they
shall
be
an
abhorring
unto
all
flesh.
Book
24	Jeremiah
001:001
The
words
of
Jeremiah
the
son
of
Hilkiah,
of
the
priests
that
were
in
Anathoth
in
the
land
of
Benjamin:
001:002
To
whom
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
in
the
days
of
Josiah
the
son
of
Amon
king
of
Judah,
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
his
reign.
001:003
It
came
also
in
the
days
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah,
unto
the
end
of
the
eleventh
year
of
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah,
unto
the
carrying
away
of
Jerusalem
captive
in
the
fifth
month.
001:004
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
001:005
Before
I
formed
thee
in
the
belly
I
knew
thee;
and
before
thou
camest
forth
out
of
the
womb
I
sanctified
thee,
and
I
ordained
thee
a
prophet
unto
the
nations.
001:006
Then
said
I,
Ah,
Lord
GOD!
behold,
I
cannot
speak:
for
I
am
a
child.
001:007
But
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Say
not,
I
am
a
child:
for
thou
shalt
go
to
all
that
I
shall
send
thee,
and
whatsoever
I
command
thee
thou
shalt
speak.
001:008
Be
not
afraid
of
their
faces:
for
I
am
with
thee
to
deliver
thee,
saith
the
LORD.
001:009
Then
the
LORD
put
forth
his
hand,
and
touched
my
mouth.
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Behold,
I
have
put
my
words
in
thy
mouth.
001:010
See,
I
have
this
day
set
thee
over
the
nations
and
over
the
kingdoms,
to
root
out,
and
to
pull
down,
and
to
destroy,
and
to
throw
down,
to
build,
and
to
plant.
001:011
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
Jeremiah,
what
seest
thou?
And
I
said,
I
see
a
rod
of
an
almond
tree.
001:012
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
me,
Thou
hast
well
seen:
for
I
will
hasten
my
word
to
perform
it.
001:013
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me
the
second
time,
saying,
What
seest
thou?
And
I
said,
I
see
a
seething
pot;
and
the
face
thereof
is
toward
the
north.
001:014
Then
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Out
of
the
north
an
evil
shall
break
forth
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land.
001:015
For,
lo,
I
will
call
all
the
families
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
north,
saith
the
LORD;
and
they
shall
come,
and
they
shall
set
every
one
his
throne
at
the
entering
of
the
gates
of
Jerusalem,
and
against
all
the
walls
thereof
round
about,
and
against
all
the
cities
of
Judah.
001:016
And
I
will
utter
my
judgments
against
them
touching
all
their
wickedness,
who
have
forsaken
me,
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods,
and
worshipped
the
works
of
their
own
hands.
001:017
Thou
therefore
gird
up
thy
loins,
and
arise,
and
speak
unto
them
all
that
I
command
thee:
be
not
dismayed
at
their
faces,
lest
I
confound
thee
before
them.
001:018
For,
behold,
I
have
made
thee
this
day
a
defenced
city,
and
an
iron
pillar,
and
brasen
walls
against
the
whole
land,
against
the
kings
of
Judah,
against
the
princes
thereof,
against
the
priests
thereof,
and
against
the
people
of
the
land.
001:019
And
they
shall
fight
against
thee;
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
thee;
for
I
am
with
thee,
saith
the
LORD,
to
deliver
thee.
002:001
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
me,
saying,
002:002
Go
and
cry
in
the
ears
of
Jerusalem,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
I
remember
thee,
the
kindness
of
thy
youth,
the
love
of
thine
espousals,
when
thou
wentest
after
me
in
the
wilderness,
in
a
land
that
was
not
sown.
002:003
Israel
was
holiness
unto
the
LORD,
and
the
firstfruits
of
his
increase:
all
that
devour
him
shall
offend;
evil
shall
come
upon
them,
saith
the
LORD.
002:004
Hear
ye
the
word
of
the
LORD,
O
house
of
Jacob,
and
all
the
families
of
the
house
of
Israel:
002:005
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
What
iniquity
have
your
fathers
found
in
me,
that
they
are
gone
far
from
me,
and
have
walked
after
vanity,
and
are
become
vain?
002:006
Neither
said
they,
Where
is
the
LORD
that
brought
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
that
led
us
through
the
wilderness,
through
a
land
of
deserts
and
of
pits,
through
a
land
of
drought,
and
of
the
shadow
of
death,
through
a
land
that
no
man
passed
through,
and
where
no
man
dwelt?
002:007
And
I
brought
you
into
a
plentiful
country,
to
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
goodness
thereof;
but
when
ye
entered,
ye
defiled
my
land,
and
made
mine
heritage
an
abomination.
002:008
The
priests
said
not,
Where
is
the
LORD?
and
they
that
handle
the
law
knew
me
not:
the
pastors
also
transgressed
against
me,
and
the
prophets
prophesied
by
Baal,
and
walked
after
things
that
do
not
profit.
002:009
Wherefore
I
will
yet
plead
with
you,
saith
the
LORD,
and
with
your
children's
children
will
I
plead.
002:010
For
pass
over
the
isles
of
Chittim,
and
see;
and
send
unto
Kedar,
and
consider
diligently,
and
see
if
there
be
such
a
thing.
002:011
Hath
a
nation
changed
their
gods,
which
are
yet
no
gods?
but
my
people
have
changed
their
glory
for
that
which
doth
not
profit.
002:012
Be
astonished,
O
ye
heavens,
at
this,
and
be
horribly
afraid,
be
ye
very
desolate,
saith
the
LORD.
002:013
For
my
people
have
committed
two
evils;
they
have
forsaken
me
the
fountain
of
living
waters,
and
hewed
them
out
cisterns,
broken
cisterns,
that
can
hold
no
water.
002:014
Is
Israel
a
servant?
is
he
a
homeborn
slave?
why
is
he
spoiled?
002:015
The
young
lions
roared
upon
him,
and
yelled,
and
they
made
his
land
waste:
his
cities
are
burned
without
inhabitant.
002:016
Also
the
children
of
Noph
and
Tahapanes
have
broken
the
crown
of
thy
head.
002:017
Hast
thou
not
procured
this
unto
thyself,
in
that
thou
hast
forsaken
the
LORD
thy
God,
when
he
led
thee
by
the
way?
002:018
And
now
what
hast
thou
to
do
in
the
way
of
Egypt,
to
drink
the
waters
of
Sihor?
or
what
hast
thou
to
do
in
the
way
of
Assyria,
to
drink
the
waters
of
the
river?
002:019
Thine
own
wickedness
shall
correct
thee,
and
thy
backslidings
shall
reprove
thee:
know
therefore
and
see
that
it
is
an
evil
thing
and
bitter,
that
thou
hast
forsaken
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
that
my
fear
is
not
in
thee,
saith
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts.
002:020
For
of
old
time
I
have
broken
thy
yoke,
and
burst
thy
bands;
and
thou
saidst,
I
will
not
transgress;
when
upon
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
thou
wanderest,
playing
the
harlot.
002:021
Yet
I
had
planted
thee
a
noble
vine,
wholly
a
right
seed:
how
then
art
thou
turned
into
the
degenerate
plant
of
a
strange
vine
unto
me?
002:022
For
though
thou
wash
thee
with
nitre,
and
take
thee
much
soap,
yet
thine
iniquity
is
marked
before
me,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
002:023
How
canst
thou
say,
I
am
not
polluted,
I
have
not
gone
after
Baalim?
see
thy
way
in
the
valley,
know
what
thou
hast
done:
thou
art
a
swift
dromedary
traversing
her
ways;
002:024
A
wild
ass
used
to
the
wilderness,
that
snuffeth
up
the
wind
at
her
pleasure;
in
her
occasion
who
can
turn
her
away?
all
they
that
seek
her
will
not
weary
themselves;
in
her
month
they
shall
find
her.
002:025
Withhold
thy
foot
from
being
unshod,
and
thy
throat
from
thirst:
but
thou
saidst,
There
is
no
hope:
no;
for
I
have
loved
strangers,
and
after
them
will
I
go.
002:026
As
the
thief
is
ashamed
when
he
is
found,
so
is
the
house
of
Israel
ashamed;
they,
their
kings,
their
princes,
and
their
priests,
and
their
prophets.
002:027
Saying
to
a
stock,
Thou
art
my
father;
and
to
a
stone,
Thou
hast
brought
me
forth:
for
they
have
turned
their
back
unto
me,
and
not
their
face:
but
in
the
time
of
their
trouble
they
will
say,
Arise,
and
save
us.
002:028
But
where
are
thy
gods
that
thou
hast
made
thee?
let
them
arise,
if
they
can
save
thee
in
the
time
of
thy
trouble:
for
according
to
the
number
of
thy
cities
are
thy
gods,
O
Judah.
002:029
Wherefore
will
ye
plead
with
me?
ye
all
have
transgressed
against
me,
saith
the
LORD.
002:030
In
vain
have
I
smitten
your
children;
they
received
no
correction:
your
own
sword
hath
devoured
your
prophets,
like
a
destroying
lion.
002:031
O
generation,
see
ye
the
word
of
the
LORD.
Have
I
been
a
wilderness
unto
Israel?
a
land
of
darkness?
wherefore
say
my
people,
We
are
lords;
we
will
come
no
more
unto
thee?
002:032
Can
a
maid
forget
her
ornaments,
or
a
bride
her
attire?
yet
my
people
have
forgotten
me
days
without
number.
002:033
Why
trimmest
thou
thy
way
to
seek
love?
therefore
hast
thou
also
taught
the
wicked
ones
thy
ways.
002:034
Also
in
thy
skirts
is
found
the
blood
of
the
souls
of
the
poor
innocents:
I
have
not
found
it
by
secret
search,
but
upon
all
these.
002:035
Yet
thou
sayest,
Because
I
am
innocent,
surely
his
anger
shall
turn
from
me.
Behold,
I
will
plead
with
thee,
because
thou
sayest,
I
have
not
sinned.
002:036
Why
gaddest
thou
about
so
much
to
change
thy
way?
thou
also
shalt
be
ashamed
of
Egypt,
as
thou
wast
ashamed
of
Assyria.
002:037
Yea,
thou
shalt
go
forth
from
him,
and
thine
hands
upon
thine
head:
for
the
LORD
hath
rejected
thy
confidences,
and
thou
shalt
not
prosper
in
them.
003:001
They
say,
If
a
man
put
away
his
wife,
and
she
go
from
him,
and
become
another
man's,
shall
he
return
unto
her
again?
shall
not
that
land
be
greatly
polluted?
but
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
with
many
lovers;
yet
return
again
to
me,
saith
the
LORD.
003:002
Lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
the
high
places,
and
see
where
thou
hast
not
been
lien
with.
In
the
ways
hast
thou
sat
for
them,
as
the
Arabian
in
the
wilderness;
and
thou
hast
polluted
the
land
with
thy
whoredoms
and
with
thy
wickedness.
003:003
Therefore
the
showers
have
been
withholden,
and
there
hath
been
no
latter
rain;
and
thou
hadst
a
whore's
forehead,
thou
refusedst
to
be
ashamed.
003:004
Wilt
thou
not
from
this
time
cry
unto
me,
My
father,
thou
art
the
guide
of
my
youth?
003:005
Will
he
reserve
his
anger
for
ever?
will
he
keep
it
to
the
end?
Behold,
thou
hast
spoken
and
done
evil
things
as
thou
couldest.
003:006
The
LORD
said
also
unto
me
in
the
days
of
Josiah
the
king,
Hast
thou
seen
that
which
backsliding
Israel
hath
done?
she
is
gone
up
upon
every
high
mountain
and
under
every
green
tree,
and
there
hath
played
the
harlot.
003:007
And
I
said
after
she
had
done
all
these
things,
Turn
thou
unto
me.
But
she
returned
not.
And
her
treacherous
sister
Judah
saw
it.
003:008
And
I
saw,
when
for
all
the
causes
whereby
backsliding
Israel
committed
adultery
I
had
put
her
away,
and
given
her
a
bill
of
divorce;
yet
her
treacherous
sister
Judah
feared
not,
but
went
and
played
the
harlot
also.
003:009
And
it
came
to
pass
through
the
lightness
of
her
whoredom,
that
she
defiled
the
land,
and
committed
adultery
with
stones
and
with
stocks.
003:010
And
yet
for
all
this
her
treacherous
sister
Judah
hath
not
turned
unto
me
with
her
whole
heart,
but
feignedly,
saith
the
LORD.
003:011
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
The
backsliding
Israel
hath
justified
herself
more
than
treacherous
Judah.
003:012
Go
and
proclaim
these
words
toward
the
north,
and
say,
Return,
thou
backsliding
Israel,
saith
the
LORD;
and
I
will
not
cause
mine
anger
to
fall
upon
you:
for
I
am
merciful,
saith
the
LORD,
and
I
will
not
keep
anger
for
ever.
003:013
Only
acknowledge
thine
iniquity,
that
thou
hast
transgressed
against
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
hast
scattered
thy
ways
to
the
strangers
under
every
green
tree,
and
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice,
saith
the
LORD.
003:014
Turn,
O
backsliding
children,
saith
the
LORD;
for
I
am
married
unto
you:
and
I
will
take
you
one
of
a
city,
and
two
of
a
family,
and
I
will
bring
you
to
Zion:
003:015
And
I
will
give
you
pastors
according
to
mine
heart,
which
shall
feed
you
with
knowledge
and
understanding.
003:016
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
ye
be
multiplied
and
increased
in
the
land,
in
those
days,
saith
the
LORD,
they
shall
say
no
more,
The
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD:
neither
shall
it
come
to
mind:
neither
shall
they
remember
it;
neither
shall
they
visit
it;
neither
shall
that
be
done
any
more.
003:017
At
that
time
they
shall
call
Jerusalem
the
throne
of
the
LORD;
and
all
the
nations
shall
be
gathered
unto
it,
to
the
name
of
the
LORD,
to
Jerusalem:
neither
shall
they
walk
any
more
after
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart.
003:018
In
those
days
the
house
of
Judah
shall
walk
with
the
house
of
Israel,
and
they
shall
come
together
out
of
the
land
of
the
north
to
the
land
that
I
have
given
for
an
inheritance
unto
your
fathers.
003:019
But
I
said,
How
shall
I
put
thee
among
the
children,
and
give
thee
a
pleasant
land,
a
goodly
heritage
of
the
hosts
of
nations?
and
I
said,
Thou
shalt
call
me,
My
father;
and
shalt
not
turn
away
from
me.
003:020
Surely
as
a
wife
treacherously
departeth
from
her
husband,
so
have
ye
dealt
treacherously
with
me,
O
house
of
Israel,
saith
the
LORD.
003:021
A
voice
was
heard
upon
the
high
places,
weeping
and
supplications
of
the
children
of
Israel:
for
they
have
perverted
their
way,
and
they
have
forgotten
the
LORD
their
God.
003:022
Return,
ye
backsliding
children,
and
I
will
heal
your
backslidings.
Behold,
we
come
unto
thee;
for
thou
art
the
LORD
our
God.
003:023
Truly
in
vain
is
salvation
hoped
for
from
the
hills,
and
from
the
multitude
of
mountains:
truly
in
the
LORD
our
God
is
the
salvation
of
Israel.
003:024
For
shame
hath
devoured
the
labour
of
our
fathers
from
our
youth;
their
flocks
and
their
herds,
their
sons
and
their
daughters.
003:025
We
lie
down
in
our
shame,
and
our
confusion
covereth
us:
for
we
have
sinned
against
the
LORD
our
God,
we
and
our
fathers,
from
our
youth
even
unto
this
day,
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
LORD
our
God.
004:001
If
thou
wilt
return,
O
Israel,
saith
the
LORD,
return
unto
me:
and
if
thou
wilt
put
away
thine
abominations
out
of
my
sight,
then
shalt
thou
not
remove.
004:002
And
thou
shalt
swear,
The
LORD
liveth,
in
truth,
in
judgment,
and
in
righteousness;
and
the
nations
shall
bless
themselves
in
him,
and
in
him
shall
they
glory.
004:003
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
to
the
men
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
Break
up
your
fallow
ground,
and
sow
not
among
thorns.
004:004
Circumcise
yourselves
to
the
LORD,
and
take
away
the
foreskins
of
your
heart,
ye
men
of
Judah
and
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem:
lest
my
fury
come
forth
like
fire,
and
burn
that
none
can
quench
it,
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings.
004:005
Declare
ye
in
Judah,
and
publish
in
Jerusalem;
and
say,
Blow
ye
the
trumpet
in
the
land:
cry,
gather
together,
and
say,
Assemble
yourselves,
and
let
us
go
into
the
defenced
cities.
004:006
Set
up
the
standard
toward
Zion:
retire,
stay
not:
for
I
will
bring
evil
from
the
north,
and
a
great
destruction.
004:007
The
lion
is
come
up
from
his
thicket,
and
the
destroyer
of
the
Gentiles
is
on
his
way;
he
is
gone
forth
from
his
place
to
make
thy
land
desolate;
and
thy
cities
shall
be
laid
waste,
without
an
inhabitant.
004:008
For
this
gird
you
with
sackcloth,
lament
and
howl:
for
the
fierce
anger
of
the
LORD
is
not
turned
back
from
us.
004:009
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
at
that
day,
saith
the
LORD,
that
the
heart
of
the
king
shall
perish,
and
the
heart
of
the
princes;
and
the
priests
shall
be
astonished,
and
the
prophets
shall
wonder.
004:010
Then
said
I,
Ah,
Lord
GOD!
