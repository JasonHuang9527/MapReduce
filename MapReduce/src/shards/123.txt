surely
thou
hast
greatly
deceived
this
people
and
Jerusalem,
saying,
Ye
shall
have
peace;
whereas
the
sword
reacheth
unto
the
soul.
004:011
At
that
time
shall
it
be
said
to
this
people
and
to
Jerusalem,
A
dry
wind
of
the
high
places
in
the
wilderness
toward
the
daughter
of
my
people,
not
to
fan,
nor
to
cleanse,
004:012
Even
a
full
wind
from
those
places
shall
come
unto
me:
now
also
will
I
give
sentence
against
them.
004:013
Behold,
he
shall
come
up
as
clouds,
and
his
chariots
shall
be
as
a
whirlwind:
his
horses
are
swifter
than
eagles.
Woe
unto
us!
for
we
are
spoiled.
004:014
O
Jerusalem,
wash
thine
heart
from
wickedness,
that
thou
mayest
be
saved.
How
long
shall
thy
vain
thoughts
lodge
within
thee?
004:015
For
a
voice
declareth
from
Dan,
and
publisheth
affliction
from
mount
Ephraim.
004:016
Make
ye
mention
to
the
nations;
behold,
publish
against
Jerusalem,
that
watchers
come
from
a
far
country,
and
give
out
their
voice
against
the
cities
of
Judah.
004:017
As
keepers
of
a
field,
are
they
against
her
round
about;
because
she
hath
been
rebellious
against
me,
saith
the
LORD.
004:018
Thy
way
and
thy
doings
have
procured
these
things
unto
thee;
this
is
thy
wickedness,
because
it
is
bitter,
because
it
reacheth
unto
thine
heart.
004:019
My
bowels,
my
bowels!
I
am
pained
at
my
very
heart;
my
heart
maketh
a
noise
in
me;
I
cannot
hold
my
peace,
because
thou
hast
heard,
O
my
soul,
the
sound
of
the
trumpet,
the
alarm
of
war.
004:020
Destruction
upon
destruction
is
cried;
for
the
whole
land
is
spoiled:
suddenly
are
my
tents
spoiled,
and
my
curtains
in
a
moment.
004:021
How
long
shall
I
see
the
standard,
and
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet?
004:022
For
my
people
is
foolish,
they
have
not
known
me;
they
are
sottish
children,
and
they
have
none
understanding:
they
are
wise
to
do
evil,
but
to
do
good
they
have
no
knowledge.
004:023
I
beheld
the
earth,
and,
lo,
it
was
without
form,
and
void;
and
the
heavens,
and
they
had
no
light.
004:024
I
beheld
the
mountains,
and,
lo,
they
trembled,
and
all
the
hills
moved
lightly.
004:025
I
beheld,
and,
lo,
there
was
no
man,
and
all
the
birds
of
the
heavens
were
fled.
004:026
I
beheld,
and,
lo,
the
fruitful
place
was
a
wilderness,
and
all
the
cities
thereof
were
broken
down
at
the
presence
of
the
LORD,
and
by
his
fierce
anger.
004:027
For
thus
hath
the
LORD
said,
The
whole
land
shall
be
desolate;
yet
will
I
not
make
a
full
end.
004:028
For
this
shall
the
earth
mourn,
and
the
heavens
above
be
black;
because
I
have
spoken
it,
I
have
purposed
it,
and
will
not
repent,
neither
will
I
turn
back
from
it.
004:029
The
whole
city
shall
flee
for
the
noise
of
the
horsemen
and
bowmen;
they
shall
go
into
thickets,
and
climb
up
upon
the
rocks:
every
city
shall
be
forsaken,
and
not
a
man
dwell
therein.
004:030
And
when
thou
art
spoiled,
what
wilt
thou
do?
Though
thou
clothest
thyself
with
crimson,
though
thou
deckest
thee
with
ornaments
of
gold,
though
thou
rentest
thy
face
with
painting,
in
vain
shalt
thou
make
thyself
fair;
thy
lovers
will
despise
thee,
they
will
seek
thy
life.
004:031
For
I
have
heard
a
voice
as
of
a
woman
in
travail,
and
the
anguish
as
of
her
that
bringeth
forth
her
first
child,
the
voice
of
the
daughter
of
Zion,
that
bewaileth
herself,
that
spreadeth
her
hands,
saying,
Woe
is
me
now!
for
my
soul
is
wearied
because
of
murderers.
005:001
Run
ye
to
and
fro
through
the
streets
of
Jerusalem,
and
see
now,
and
know,
and
seek
in
the
broad
places
thereof,
if
ye
can
find
a
man,
if
there
be
any
that
executeth
judgment,
that
seeketh
the
truth;
and
I
will
pardon
it.
005:002
And
though
they
say,
The
LORD
liveth;
surely
they
swear
falsely.
005:003
O
LORD,
are
not
thine
eyes
upon
the
truth?
thou
hast
stricken
them,
but
they
have
not
grieved;
thou
hast
consumed
them,
but
they
have
refused
to
receive
correction:
they
have
made
their
faces
harder
than
a
rock;
they
have
refused
to
return.
005:004
Therefore
I
said,
Surely
these
are
poor;
they
are
foolish:
for
they
know
not
the
way
of
the
LORD,
nor
the
judgment
of
their
God.
005:005
I
will
get
me
unto
the
great
men,
and
will
speak
unto
them;
for
they
have
known
the
way
of
the
LORD,
and
the
judgment
of
their
God:
but
these
have
altogether
broken
the
yoke,
and
burst
the
bonds.
005:006
Wherefore
a
lion
out
of
the
forest
shall
slay
them,
and
a
wolf
of
the
evenings
shall
spoil
them,
a
leopard
shall
watch
over
their
cities:
every
one
that
goeth
out
thence
shall
be
torn
in
pieces:
because
their
transgressions
are
many,
and
their
backslidings
are
increased.
005:007
How
shall
I
pardon
thee
for
this?
thy
children
have
forsaken
me,
and
sworn
by
them
that
are
no
gods:
when
I
had
fed
them
to
the
full,
they
then
committed
adultery,
and
assembled
themselves
by
troops
in
the
harlots'
houses.
005:008
They
were
as
fed
horses
in
the
morning:
every
one
neighed
after
his
neighbour's
wife.
005:009
Shall
I
not
visit
for
these
things?
saith
the
LORD:
and
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this?
005:010
Go
ye
up
upon
her
walls,
and
destroy;
but
make
not
a
full
end:
take
away
her
battlements;
for
they
are
not
the
LORD's.
005:011
For
the
house
of
Israel
and
the
house
of
Judah
have
dealt
very
treacherously
against
me,
saith
the
LORD.
005:012
They
have
belied
the
LORD,
and
said,
It
is
not
he;
neither
shall
evil
come
upon
us;
neither
shall
we
see
sword
nor
famine:
005:013
And
the
prophets
shall
become
wind,
and
the
word
is
not
in
them:
thus
shall
it
be
done
unto
them.
005:014
Wherefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
hosts,
Because
ye
speak
this
word,
behold,
I
will
make
my
words
in
thy
mouth
fire,
and
this
people
wood,
and
it
shall
devour
them.
005:015
Lo,
I
will
bring
a
nation
upon
you
from
far,
O
house
of
Israel,
saith
the
LORD:
it
is
a
mighty
nation,
it
is
an
ancient
nation,
a
nation
whose
language
thou
knowest
not,
neither
understandest
what
they
say.
005:016
Their
quiver
is
as
an
open
sepulchre,
they
are
all
mighty
men.
005:017
And
they
shall
eat
up
thine
harvest,
and
thy
bread,
which
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
should
eat:
they
shall
eat
up
thy
flocks
and
thine
herds:
they
shall
eat
up
thy
vines
and
thy
fig
trees:
they
shall
impoverish
thy
fenced
cities,
wherein
thou
trustedst,
with
the
sword.
005:018
Nevertheless
in
those
days,
saith
the
LORD,
I
will
not
make
a
full
end
with
you.
005:019
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
ye
shall
say,
Wherefore
doeth
the
LORD
our
God
all
these
things
unto
us?
then
shalt
thou
answer
them,
Like
as
ye
have
forsaken
me,
and
served
strange
gods
in
your
land,
so
shall
ye
serve
strangers
in
a
land
that
is
not
your's.
005:020
Declare
this
in
the
house
of
Jacob,
and
publish
it
in
Judah,
saying,
005:021
Hear
now
this,
O
foolish
people,
and
without
understanding;
which
have
eyes,
and
see
not;
which
have
ears,
and
hear
not:
005:022
Fear
ye
not
me?
saith
the
LORD:
will
ye
not
tremble
at
my
presence,
which
have
placed
the
sand
for
the
bound
of
the
sea
by
a
perpetual
decree,
that
it
cannot
pass
it:
and
though
the
waves
thereof
toss
themselves,
yet
can
they
not
prevail;
though
they
roar,
yet
can
they
not
pass
over
it?
005:023
But
this
people
hath
a
revolting
and
a
rebellious
heart;
they
are
revolted
and
gone.
005:024
Neither
say
they
in
their
heart,
Let
us
now
fear
the
LORD
our
God,
that
giveth
rain,
both
the
former
and
the
latter,
in
his
season:
he
reserveth
unto
us
the
appointed
weeks
of
the
harvest.
005:025
Your
iniquities
have
turned
away
these
things,
and
your
sins
have
withholden
good
things
from
you.
005:026
For
among
my
people
are
found
wicked
men:
they
lay
wait,
as
he
that
setteth
snares;
they
set
a
trap,
they
catch
men.
005:027
As
a
cage
is
full
of
birds,
so
are
their
houses
full
of
deceit:
therefore
they
are
become
great,
and
waxen
rich.
005:028
They
are
waxen
fat,
they
shine:
yea,
they
overpass
the
deeds
of
the
wicked:
they
judge
not
the
cause,
the
cause
of
the
fatherless,
yet
they
prosper;
and
the
right
of
the
needy
do
they
not
judge.
005:029
Shall
I
not
visit
for
these
things?
saith
the
LORD:
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this?
005:030
A
wonderful
and
horrible
thing
is
committed
in
the
land;
005:031
The
prophets
prophesy
falsely,
and
the
priests
bear
rule
by
their
means;
and
my
people
love
to
have
it
so:
and
what
will
ye
do
in
the
end
thereof?
006:001
O
ye
children
of
Benjamin,
gather
yourselves
to
flee
out
of
the
midst
of
Jerusalem,
and
blow
the
trumpet
in
Tekoa,
and
set
up
a
sign
of
fire
in
Bethhaccerem:
for
evil
appeareth
out
of
the
north,
and
great
destruction.
006:002
I
have
likened
the
daughter
of
Zion
to
a
comely
and
delicate
woman.
006:003
The
shepherds
with
their
flocks
shall
come
unto
her;
they
shall
pitch
their
tents
against
her
round
about;
they
shall
feed
every
one
in
his
place.
006:004
Prepare
ye
war
against
her;
arise,
and
let
us
go
up
at
noon.
Woe
unto
us!
for
the
day
goeth
away,
for
the
shadows
of
the
evening
are
stretched
out.
006:005
Arise,
and
let
us
go
by
night,
and
let
us
destroy
her
palaces.
006:006
For
thus
hath
the
LORD
of
hosts
said,
Hew
ye
down
trees,
and
cast
a
mount
against
Jerusalem:
this
is
the
city
to
be
visited;
she
is
wholly
oppression
in
the
midst
of
her.
006:007
As
a
fountain
casteth
out
her
waters,
so
she
casteth
out
her
wickedness:
violence
and
spoil
is
heard
in
her;
before
me
continually
is
grief
and
wounds.
006:008
Be
thou
instructed,
O
Jerusalem,
lest
my
soul
depart
from
thee;
lest
I
make
thee
desolate,
a
land
not
inhabited.
006:009
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
They
shall
throughly
glean
the
remnant
of
Israel
as
a
vine:
turn
back
thine
hand
as
a
grapegatherer
into
the
baskets.
006:010
To
whom
shall
I
speak,
and
give
warning,
that
they
may
hear?
behold,
their
ear
is
uncircumcised,
and
they
cannot
hearken:
behold,
the
word
of
the
LORD
is
unto
them
a
reproach;
they
have
no
delight
in
it.
006:011
Therefore
I
am
full
of
the
fury
of
the
LORD;
I
am
weary
with
holding
in:
I
will
pour
it
out
upon
the
children
abroad,
and
upon
the
assembly
of
young
men
together:
for
even
the
husband
with
the
wife
shall
be
taken,
the
aged
with
him
that
is
full
of
days.
006:012
And
their
houses
shall
be
turned
unto
others,
with
their
fields
and
wives
together:
for
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
land,
saith
the
LORD.
006:013
For
from
the
least
of
them
even
unto
the
greatest
of
them
every
one
is
given
to
covetousness;
and
from
the
prophet
even
unto
the
priest
every
one
dealeth
falsely.
006:014
They
have
healed
also
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
slightly,
saying,
Peace,
peace;
when
there
is
no
peace.
006:015
Were
they
ashamed
when
they
had
committed
abomination?
nay,
they
were
not
at
all
ashamed,
neither
could
they
blush:
therefore
they
shall
fall
among
them
that
fall:
at
the
time
that
I
visit
them
they
shall
be
cast
down,
saith
the
LORD.
006:016
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Stand
ye
in
the
ways,
and
see,
and
ask
for
the
old
paths,
where
is
the
good
way,
and
walk
therein,
and
ye
shall
find
rest
for
your
souls.
But
they
said,
We
will
not
walk
therein.
006:017
Also
I
set
watchmen
over
you,
saying,
Hearken
to
the
sound
of
the
trumpet.
But
they
said,
We
will
not
hearken.
006:018
Therefore
hear,
ye
nations,
and
know,
O
congregation,
what
is
among
them.
006:019
Hear,
O
earth:
behold,
I
will
bring
evil
upon
this
people,
even
the
fruit
of
their
thoughts,
because
they
have
not
hearkened
unto
my
words,
nor
to
my
law,
but
rejected
it.
006:020
To
what
purpose
cometh
there
to
me
incense
from
Sheba,
and
the
sweet
cane
from
a
far
country?
your
burnt
offerings
are
not
acceptable,
nor
your
sacrifices
sweet
unto
me.
006:021
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
lay
stumblingblocks
before
this
people,
and
the
fathers
and
the
sons
together
shall
fall
upon
them;
the
neighbour
and
his
friend
shall
perish.
006:022
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
a
people
cometh
from
the
north
country,
and
a
great
nation
shall
be
raised
from
the
sides
of
the
earth.
006:023
They
shall
lay
hold
on
bow
and
spear;
they
are
cruel,
and
have
no
mercy;
their
voice
roareth
like
the
sea;
and
they
ride
upon
horses,
set
in
array
as
men
for
war
against
thee,
O
daughter
of
Zion.
006:024
We
have
heard
the
fame
thereof:
our
hands
wax
feeble:
anguish
hath
taken
hold
of
us,
and
pain,
as
of
a
woman
in
travail.
006:025
Go
not
forth
into
the
field,
nor
walk
by
the
way;
for
the
sword
of
the
enemy
and
fear
is
on
every
side.
006:026
O
daughter
of
my
people,
gird
thee
with
sackcloth,
and
wallow
thyself
in
ashes:
make
thee
mourning,
as
for
an
only
son,
most
bitter
lamentation:
for
the
spoiler
shall
suddenly
come
upon
us.
006:027
I
have
set
thee
for
a
tower
and
a
fortress
among
my
people,
that
thou
mayest
know
and
try
their
way.
006:028
They
are
all
grievous
revolters,
walking
with
slanders:
they
are
brass
and
iron;
they
are
all
corrupters.
006:029
The
bellows
are
burned,
the
lead
is
consumed
of
the
fire;
the
founder
melteth
in
vain:
for
the
wicked
are
not
plucked
away.
006:030
Reprobate
silver
shall
men
call
them,
because
the
LORD
hath
rejected
them.
007:001
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
saying,
007:002
Stand
in
the
gate
of
the
LORD's
house,
and
proclaim
there
this
word,
and
say,
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
all
ye
of
Judah,
that
enter
in
at
these
gates
to
worship
the
LORD.
007:003
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
Amend
your
ways
and
your
doings,
and
I
will
cause
you
to
dwell
in
this
place.
007:004
Trust
ye
not
in
lying
words,
saying,
The
temple
of
the
LORD,
The
temple
of
the
LORD,
The
temple
of
the
LORD,
are
these.
007:005
For
if
ye
throughly
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings;
if
ye
throughly
execute
judgment
between
a
man
and
his
neighbour;
007:006
If
ye
oppress
not
the
stranger,
the
fatherless,
and
the
widow,
and
shed
not
innocent
blood
in
this
place,
neither
walk
after
other
gods
to
your
hurt:
007:007
Then
will
I
cause
you
to
dwell
in
this
place,
in
the
land
that
I
gave
to
your
fathers,
for
ever
and
ever.
007:008
Behold,
ye
trust
in
lying
words,
that
cannot
profit.
007:009
Will
ye
steal,
murder,
and
commit
adultery,
and
swear
falsely,
and
burn
incense
unto
Baal,
and
walk
after
other
gods
whom
ye
know
not;
007:010
And
come
and
stand
before
me
in
this
house,
which
is
called
by
my
name,
and
say,
We
are
delivered
to
do
all
these
abominations?
007:011
Is
this
house,
which
is
called
by
my
name,
become
a
den
of
robbers
in
your
eyes?
Behold,
even
I
have
seen
it,
saith
the
LORD.
007:012
But
go
ye
now
unto
my
place
which
was
in
Shiloh,
where
I
set
my
name
at
the
first,
and
see
what
I
did
to
it
for
the
wickedness
of
my
people
Israel.
007:013
And
now,
because
ye
have
done
all
these
works,
saith
the
LORD,
and
I
spake
unto
you,
rising
up
early
and
speaking,
but
ye
heard
not;
and
I
called
you,
but
ye
answered
not;
007:014
Therefore
will
I
do
unto
this
house,
which
is
called
by
my
name,
wherein
ye
trust,
and
unto
the
place
which
I
gave
to
you
and
to
your
fathers,
as
I
have
done
to
Shiloh.
007:015
And
I
will
cast
you
out
of
my
sight,
as
I
have
cast
out
all
your
brethren,
even
the
whole
seed
of
Ephraim.
007:016
Therefore
pray
not
thou
for
this
people,
neither
lift
up
cry
nor
prayer
for
them,
neither
make
intercession
to
me:
for
I
will
not
hear
thee.
007:017
Seest
thou
not
what
they
do
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem?
007:018
The
children
gather
wood,
and
the
fathers
kindle
the
fire,
and
the
women
knead
their
dough,
to
make
cakes
to
the
queen
of
heaven,
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods,
that
they
may
provoke
me
to
anger.
007:019
Do
they
provoke
me
to
anger?
saith
the
LORD:
do
they
not
provoke
themselves
to
the
confusion
of
their
own
faces?
007:020
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
mine
anger
and
my
fury
shall
be
poured
out
upon
this
place,
upon
man,
and
upon
beast,
and
upon
the
trees
of
the
field,
and
upon
the
fruit
of
the
ground;
and
it
shall
burn,
and
shall
not
be
quenched.
007:021
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Put
your
burnt
offerings
unto
your
sacrifices,
and
eat
flesh.
007:022
For
I
spake
not
unto
your
fathers,
nor
commanded
them
in
the
day
that
I
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
concerning
burnt
offerings
or
sacrifices:
007:023
But
this
thing
commanded
I
them,
saying,
Obey
my
voice,
and
I
will
be
your
God,
and
ye
shall
be
my
people:
and
walk
ye
in
all
the
ways
that
I
have
commanded
you,
that
it
may
be
well
unto
you.
007:024
But
they
hearkened
not,
nor
inclined
their
ear,
but
walked
in
the
counsels
and
in
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart,
and
went
backward,
and
not
forward.
007:025
Since
the
day
that
your
fathers
came
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
unto
this
day
I
have
even
sent
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets,
daily
rising
up
early
and
sending
them:
007:026
Yet
they
hearkened
not
unto
me,
nor
inclined
their
ear,
but
hardened
their
neck:
they
did
worse
than
their
fathers.
007:027
Therefore
thou
shalt
speak
all
these
words
unto
them;
but
they
will
not
hearken
to
thee:
thou
shalt
also
call
unto
them;
but
they
will
not
answer
thee.
007:028
But
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
This
is
a
nation
that
obeyeth
not
the
voice
of
the
LORD
their
God,
nor
receiveth
correction:
truth
is
perished,
and
is
cut
off
from
their
mouth.
007:029
Cut
off
thine
hair,
O
Jerusalem,
and
cast
it
away,
and
take
up
a
lamentation
on
high
places;
for
the
LORD
hath
rejected
and
forsaken
the
generation
of
his
wrath.
007:030
For
the
children
of
Judah
have
done
evil
in
my
sight,
saith
the
LORD:
they
have
set
their
abominations
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
name,
to
pollute
it.
007:031
And
they
have
built
the
high
places
of
Tophet,
which
is
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
to
burn
their
sons
and
their
daughters
in
the
fire;
which
I
commanded
them
not,
neither
came
it
into
my
heart.
007:032
Therefore,
behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
it
shall
no
more
be
called
Tophet,
nor
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
but
the
valley
of
slaughter:
for
they
shall
bury
in
Tophet,
till
there
be
no
place.
007:033
And
the
carcases
of
this
people
shall
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
the
heaven,
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth;
and
none
shall
fray
them
away.
007:034
Then
will
I
cause
to
cease
from
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
from
the
streets
of
Jerusalem,
the
voice
of
mirth,
and
the
voice
of
gladness,
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom,
and
the
voice
of
the
bride:
for
the
land
shall
be
desolate.
008:001
At
that
time,
saith
the
LORD,
they
shall
bring
out
the
bones
of
the
kings
of
Judah,
and
the
bones
of
his
princes,
and
the
bones
of
the
priests,
and
the
bones
of
the
prophets,
and
the
bones
of
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
out
of
their
graves:
008:002
And
they
shall
spread
them
before
the
sun,
and
the
moon,
and
all
the
host
of
heaven,
whom
they
have
loved,
and
whom
they
have
served,
and
after
whom
they
have
walked,
and
whom
they
have
sought,
and
whom
they
have
worshipped:
they
shall
not
be
gathered,
nor
be
buried;
they
shall
be
for
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
earth.
008:003
And
death
shall
be
chosen
rather
than
life
by
all
the
residue
of
them
that
remain
of
this
evil
family,
which
remain
in
all
the
places
whither
I
have
driven
them,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
008:004
Moreover
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Shall
they
fall,
and
not
arise?
shall
he
turn
away,
and
not
return?
008:005
Why
then
is
this
people
of
Jerusalem
slidden
back
by
a
perpetual
backsliding?
they
hold
fast
deceit,
they
refuse
to
return.
008:006
I
hearkened
and
heard,
but
they
spake
not
aright:
no
man
repented
him
of
his
wickedness,
saying,
What
have
I
done?
every
one
turned
to
his
course,
as
the
horse
rusheth
into
the
battle.
008:007
Yea,
the
stork
in
the
heaven
knoweth
her
appointed
times;
and
the
turtle
and
the
crane
and
the
swallow
observe
the
time
of
their
coming;
but
my
people
know
not
the
judgment
of
the
LORD.
008:008
How
do
ye
say,
We
are
wise,
and
the
law
of
the
LORD
is
with
us?
Lo,
certainly
in
vain
made
he
it;
the
pen
of
the
scribes
is
in
vain.
008:009
The
wise
men
are
ashamed,
they
are
dismayed
and
taken:
lo,
they
have
rejected
the
word
of
the
LORD;
and
what
wisdom
is
in
them?
008:010
Therefore
will
I
give
their
wives
unto
others,
and
their
fields
to
them
that
shall
inherit
them:
for
every
one
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
is
given
to
covetousness,
from
the
prophet
even
unto
the
priest
every
one
dealeth
falsely.
008:011
For
they
have
healed
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
slightly,
saying,
Peace,
peace;
when
there
is
no
peace.
008:012
Were
they
ashamed
when
they
had
committed
abomination?
nay,
they
were
not
at
all
ashamed,
neither
could
they
blush:
therefore
shall
they
fall
among
them
that
fall:
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they
shall
be
cast
down,
saith
the
LORD.
008:013
I
will
surely
consume
them,
saith
the
LORD:
there
shall
be
no
grapes
on
the
vine,
nor
figs
on
the
fig
tree,
and
the
leaf
shall
fade;
and
the
things
that
I
have
given
them
shall
pass
away
from
them.
008:014
Why
do
we
sit
still?
assemble
yourselves,
and
let
us
enter
into
the
defenced
cities,
and
let
us
be
silent
there:
for
the
LORD
our
God
hath
put
us
to
silence,
and
given
us
water
of
gall
to
drink,
because
we
have
sinned
against
the
LORD.
008:015
We
looked
for
peace,
but
no
good
came;
and
for
a
time
of
health,
and
behold
trouble!
008:016
The
snorting
of
his
horses
was
heard
from
Dan:
the
whole
land
trembled
at
the
sound
of
the
neighing
of
his
strong
ones;
for
they
are
come,
and
have
devoured
the
land,
and
all
that
is
in
it;
the
city,
and
those
that
dwell
therein.
008:017
For,
behold,
I
will
send
serpents,
cockatrices,
among
you,
which
will
not
be
charmed,
and
they
shall
bite
you,
saith
the
LORD.
008:018
When
I
would
comfort
myself
against
sorrow,
my
heart
is
faint
in
me.
008:019
Behold
the
voice
of
the
cry
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
because
of
them
that
dwell
in
a
far
country:
Is
not
the
LORD
in
Zion?
is
not
her
king
in
her?
Why
have
they
provoked
me
to
anger
with
their
graven
images,
and
with
strange
vanities?
008:020
The
harvest
is
past,
the
summer
is
ended,
and
we
are
not
saved.
008:021
For
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
am
I
hurt;
I
am
black;
astonishment
hath
taken
hold
on
me.
008:022
Is
there
no
balm
in
Gilead;
is
there
no
physician
there?
why
then
is
not
the
health
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
