recovered?
009:001
Oh
that
my
head
were
waters,
and
mine
eyes
a
fountain
of
tears,
that
I
might
weep
day
and
night
for
the
slain
of
the
daughter
of
my
people!
009:002
Oh
that
I
had
in
the
wilderness
a
lodging
place
of
wayfaring
men;
that
I
might
leave
my
people,
and
go
from
them!
for
they
be
all
adulterers,
an
assembly
of
treacherous
men.
009:003
And
they
bend
their
tongues
like
their
bow
for
lies:
but
they
are
not
valiant
for
the
truth
upon
the
earth;
for
they
proceed
from
evil
to
evil,
and
they
know
not
me,
saith
the
LORD.
009:004
Take
ye
heed
every
one
of
his
neighbour,
and
trust
ye
not
in
any
brother:
for
every
brother
will
utterly
supplant,
and
every
neighbour
will
walk
with
slanders.
009:005
And
they
will
deceive
every
one
his
neighbour,
and
will
not
speak
the
truth:
they
have
taught
their
tongue
to
speak
lies,
and
weary
themselves
to
commit
iniquity.
009:006
Thine
habitation
is
in
the
midst
of
deceit;
through
deceit
they
refuse
to
know
me,
saith
the
LORD.
009:007
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
Behold,
I
will
melt
them,
and
try
them;
for
how
shall
I
do
for
the
daughter
of
my
people?
009:008
Their
tongue
is
as
an
arrow
shot
out;
it
speaketh
deceit:
one
speaketh
peaceably
to
his
neighbour
with
his
mouth,
but
in
heart
he
layeth
his
wait.
009:009
Shall
I
not
visit
them
for
these
things?
saith
the
LORD:
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this?
009:010
For
the
mountains
will
I
take
up
a
weeping
and
wailing,
and
for
the
habitations
of
the
wilderness
a
lamentation,
because
they
are
burned
up,
so
that
none
can
pass
through
them;
neither
can
men
hear
the
voice
of
the
cattle;
both
the
fowl
of
the
heavens
and
the
beast
are
fled;
they
are
gone.
009:011
And
I
will
make
Jerusalem
heaps,
and
a
den
of
dragons;
and
I
will
make
the
cities
of
Judah
desolate,
without
an
inhabitant.
009:012
Who
is
the
wise
man,
that
may
understand
this?
and
who
is
he
to
whom
the
mouth
of
the
LORD
hath
spoken,
that
he
may
declare
it,
for
what
the
land
perisheth
and
is
burned
up
like
a
wilderness,
that
none
passeth
through?
009:013
And
the
LORD
saith,
Because
they
have
forsaken
my
law
which
I
set
before
them,
and
have
not
obeyed
my
voice,
neither
walked
therein;
009:014
But
have
walked
after
the
imagination
of
their
own
heart,
and
after
Baalim,
which
their
fathers
taught
them:
009:015
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Behold,
I
will
feed
them,
even
this
people,
with
wormwood,
and
give
them
water
of
gall
to
drink.
009:016
I
will
scatter
them
also
among
the
heathen,
whom
neither
they
nor
their
fathers
have
known:
and
I
will
send
a
sword
after
them,
till
I
have
consumed
them.
009:017
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
Consider
ye,
and
call
for
the
mourning
women,
that
they
may
come;
and
send
for
cunning
women,
that
they
may
come:
009:018
And
let
them
make
haste,
and
take
up
a
wailing
for
us,
that
our
eyes
may
run
down
with
tears,
and
our
eyelids
gush
out
with
waters.
009:019
For
a
voice
of
wailing
is
heard
out
of
Zion,
How
are
we
spoiled!
we
are
greatly
confounded,
because
we
have
forsaken
the
land,
because
our
dwellings
have
cast
us
out.
009:020
Yet
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
O
ye
women,
and
let
your
ear
receive
the
word
of
his
mouth,
and
teach
your
daughters
wailing,
and
every
one
her
neighbour
lamentation.
009:021
For
death
is
come
up
into
our
windows,
and
is
entered
into
our
palaces,
to
cut
off
the
children
from
without,
and
the
young
men
from
the
streets.
009:022
Speak,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Even
the
carcases
of
men
shall
fall
as
dung
upon
the
open
field,
and
as
the
handful
after
the
harvestman,
and
none
shall
gather
them.
009:023
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Let
not
the
wise
man
glory
in
his
wisdom,
neither
let
the
mighty
man
glory
in
his
might,
let
not
the
rich
man
glory
in
his
riches:
009:024
But
let
him
that
glorieth
glory
in
this,
that
he
understandeth
and
knoweth
me,
that
I
am
the
LORD
which
exercise
lovingkindness,
judgment,
and
righteousness,
in
the
earth:
for
in
these
things
I
delight,
saith
the
LORD.
009:025
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
punish
all
them
which
are
circumcised
with
the
uncircumcised;
009:026
Egypt,
and
Judah,
and
Edom,
and
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
Moab,
and
all
that
are
in
the
utmost
corners,
that
dwell
in
the
wilderness:
for
all
these
nations
are
uncircumcised,
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
are
uncircumcised
in
the
heart.
010:001
Hear
ye
the
word
which
the
LORD
speaketh
unto
you,
O
house
of
Israel:
010:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Learn
not
the
way
of
the
heathen,
and
be
not
dismayed
at
the
signs
of
heaven;
for
the
heathen
are
dismayed
at
them.
010:003
For
the
customs
of
the
people
are
vain:
for
one
cutteth
a
tree
out
of
the
forest,
the
work
of
the
hands
of
the
workman,
with
the
axe.
010:004
They
deck
it
with
silver
and
with
gold;
they
fasten
it
with
nails
and
with
hammers,
that
it
move
not.
010:005
They
are
upright
as
the
palm
tree,
but
speak
not:
they
must
needs
be
borne,
because
they
cannot
go.
Be
not
afraid
of
them;
for
they
cannot
do
evil,
neither
also
is
it
in
them
to
do
good.
010:006
Forasmuch
as
there
is
none
like
unto
thee,
O
LORD;
thou
art
great,
and
thy
name
is
great
in
might.
010:007
Who
would
not
fear
thee,
O
King
of
nations?
for
to
thee
doth
it
appertain:
forasmuch
as
among
all
the
wise
men
of
the
nations,
and
in
all
their
kingdoms,
there
is
none
like
unto
thee.
010:008
But
they
are
altogether
brutish
and
foolish:
the
stock
is
a
doctrine
of
vanities.
010:009
Silver
spread
into
plates
is
brought
from
Tarshish,
and
gold
from
Uphaz,
the
work
of
the
workman,
and
of
the
hands
of
the
founder:
blue
and
purple
is
their
clothing:
they
are
all
the
work
of
cunning
men.
010:010
But
the
LORD
is
the
true
God,
he
is
the
living
God,
and
an
everlasting
king:
at
his
wrath
the
earth
shall
tremble,
and
the
nations
shall
not
be
able
to
abide
his
indignation.
010:011
Thus
shall
ye
say
unto
them,
The
gods
that
have
not
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth,
even
they
shall
perish
from
the
earth,
and
from
under
these
heavens.
010:012
He
hath
made
the
earth
by
his
power,
he
hath
established
the
world
by
his
wisdom,
and
hath
stretched
out
the
heavens
by
his
discretion.
010:013
When
he
uttereth
his
voice,
there
is
a
multitude
of
waters
in
the
heavens,
and
he
causeth
the
vapours
to
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth;
he
maketh
lightnings
with
rain,
and
bringeth
forth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasures.
010:014
Every
man
is
brutish
in
his
knowledge:
every
founder
is
confounded
by
the
graven
image:
for
his
molten
image
is
falsehood,
and
there
is
no
breath
in
them.
010:015
They
are
vanity,
and
the
work
of
errors:
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they
shall
perish.
010:016
The
portion
of
Jacob
is
not
like
them:
for
he
is
the
former
of
all
things;
and
Israel
is
the
rod
of
his
inheritance:
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
his
name.
010:017
Gather
up
thy
wares
out
of
the
land,
O
inhabitant
of
the
fortress.
010:018
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
sling
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
at
this
once,
and
will
distress
them,
that
they
may
find
it
so.
010:019
Woe
is
me
for
my
hurt!
my
wound
is
grievous;
but
I
said,
Truly
this
is
a
grief,
and
I
must
bear
it.
010:020
My
tabernacle
is
spoiled,
and
all
my
cords
are
broken:
my
children
are
gone
forth
of
me,
and
they
are
not:
there
is
none
to
stretch
forth
my
tent
any
more,
and
to
set
up
my
curtains.
010:021
For
the
pastors
are
become
brutish,
and
have
not
sought
the
LORD:
therefore
they
shall
not
prosper,
and
all
their
flocks
shall
be
scattered.
010:022
Behold,
the
noise
of
the
bruit
is
come,
and
a
great
commotion
out
of
the
north
country,
to
make
the
cities
of
Judah
desolate,
and
a
den
of
dragons.
010:023
O
LORD,
I
know
that
the
way
of
man
is
not
in
himself:
it
is
not
in
man
that
walketh
to
direct
his
steps.
010:024
O
LORD,
correct
me,
but
with
judgment;
not
in
thine
anger,
lest
thou
bring
me
to
nothing.
010:025
Pour
out
thy
fury
upon
the
heathen
that
know
thee
not,
and
upon
the
families
that
call
not
on
thy
name:
for
they
have
eaten
up
Jacob,
and
devoured
him,
and
consumed
him,
and
have
made
his
habitation
desolate.
011:001
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD
saying,
011:002
Hear
ye
the
words
of
this
covenant,
and
speak
unto
the
men
of
Judah,
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem;
011:003
And
say
thou
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel;
Cursed
be
the
man
that
obeyeth
not
the
words
of
this
covenant,
011:004
Which
I
commanded
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
I
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
from
the
iron
furnace,
saying,
Obey
my
voice,
and
do
them,
according
to
all
which
I
command
you:
so
shall
ye
be
my
people,
and
I
will
be
your
God:
011:005
That
I
may
perform
the
oath
which
I
have
sworn
unto
your
fathers,
to
give
them
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey,
as
it
is
this
day.
Then
answered
I,
and
said,
So
be
it,
O
LORD.
011:006
Then
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Proclaim
all
these
words
in
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem,
saying,
Hear
ye
the
words
of
this
covenant,
and
do
them.
011:007
For
I
earnestly
protested
unto
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
I
brought
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
even
unto
this
day,
rising
early
and
protesting,
saying,
Obey
my
voice.
011:008
Yet
they
obeyed
not,
nor
inclined
their
ear,
but
walked
every
one
in
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart:
therefore
I
will
bring
upon
them
all
the
words
of
this
covenant,
which
I
commanded
them
to
do:
but
they
did
them
not.
011:009
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
A
conspiracy
is
found
among
the
men
of
Judah,
and
among
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem.
011:010
They
are
turned
back
to
the
iniquities
of
their
forefathers,
which
refused
to
hear
my
words;
and
they
went
after
other
gods
to
serve
them:
the
house
of
Israel
and
the
house
of
Judah
have
broken
my
covenant
which
I
made
with
their
fathers.
011:011
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
bring
evil
upon
them,
which
they
shall
not
be
able
to
escape;
and
though
they
shall
cry
unto
me,
I
will
not
hearken
unto
them.
011:012
Then
shall
the
cities
of
Judah
and
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
go,
and
cry
unto
the
gods
unto
whom
they
offer
incense:
but
they
shall
not
save
them
at
all
in
the
time
of
their
trouble.
011:013
For
according
to
the
number
of
thy
cities
were
thy
gods,
O
Judah;
and
according
to
the
number
of
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
have
ye
set
up
altars
to
that
shameful
thing,
even
altars
to
burn
incense
unto
Baal.
011:014
Therefore
pray
not
thou
for
this
people,
neither
lift
up
a
cry
or
prayer
for
them:
for
I
will
not
hear
them
in
the
time
that
they
cry
unto
me
for
their
trouble.
011:015
What
hath
my
beloved
to
do
in
mine
house,
seeing
she
hath
wrought
lewdness
with
many,
and
the
holy
flesh
is
passed
from
thee?
when
thou
doest
evil,
then
thou
rejoicest.
011:016
The
LORD
called
thy
name,
A
green
olive
tree,
fair,
and
of
goodly
fruit:
with
the
noise
of
a
great
tumult
he
hath
kindled
fire
upon
it,
and
the
branches
of
it
are
broken.
011:017
For
the
LORD
of
hosts,
that
planted
thee,
hath
pronounced
evil
against
thee,
for
the
evil
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
of
the
house
of
Judah,
which
they
have
done
against
themselves
to
provoke
me
to
anger
in
offering
incense
unto
Baal.
011:018
And
the
LORD
hath
given
me
knowledge
of
it,
and
I
know
it:
then
thou
shewedst
me
their
doings.
011:019
But
I
was
like
a
lamb
or
an
ox
that
is
brought
to
the
slaughter;
and
I
knew
not
that
they
had
devised
devices
against
me,
saying,
Let
us
destroy
the
tree
with
the
fruit
thereof,
and
let
us
cut
him
off
from
the
land
of
the
living,
that
his
name
may
be
no
more
remembered.
011:020
But,
O
LORD
of
hosts,
that
judgest
righteously,
that
triest
the
reins
and
the
heart,
let
me
see
thy
vengeance
on
them:
for
unto
thee
have
I
revealed
my
cause.
011:021
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
men
of
Anathoth,
that
seek
thy
life,
saying,
Prophesy
not
in
the
name
of
the
LORD,
that
thou
die
not
by
our
hand:
011:022
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
Behold,
I
will
punish
them:
the
young
men
shall
die
by
the
sword;
their
sons
and
their
daughters
shall
die
by
famine:
011:023
And
there
shall
be
no
remnant
of
them:
for
I
will
bring
evil
upon
the
men
of
Anathoth,
even
the
year
of
their
visitation.
012:001
Righteous
art
thou,
O
LORD,
when
I
plead
with
thee:
yet
let
me
talk
with
thee
of
thy
judgments:
Wherefore
doth
the
way
of
the
wicked
prosper?
wherefore
are
all
they
happy
that
deal
very
treacherously?
012:002
Thou
hast
planted
them,
yea,
they
have
taken
root:
they
grow,
yea,
they
bring
forth
fruit:
thou
art
near
in
their
mouth,
and
far
from
their
reins.
012:003
But
thou,
O
LORD,
knowest
me:
thou
hast
seen
me,
and
tried
mine
heart
toward
thee:
pull
them
out
like
sheep
for
the
slaughter,
and
prepare
them
for
the
day
of
slaughter.
012:004
How
long
shall
the
land
mourn,
and
the
herbs
of
every
field
wither,
for
the
wickedness
of
them
that
dwell
therein?
the
beasts
are
consumed,
and
the
birds;
because
they
said,
He
shall
not
see
our
last
end.
012:005
If
thou
hast
run
with
the
footmen,
and
they
have
wearied
thee,
then
how
canst
thou
contend
with
horses?
and
if
in
the
land
of
peace,
wherein
thou
trustedst,
they
wearied
thee,
then
how
wilt
thou
do
in
the
swelling
of
Jordan?
012:006
For
even
thy
brethren,
and
the
house
of
thy
father,
even
they
have
dealt
treacherously
with
thee;
yea,
they
have
called
a
multitude
after
thee:
believe
them
not,
though
they
speak
fair
words
unto
thee.
012:007
I
have
forsaken
mine
house,
I
have
left
mine
heritage;
I
have
given
the
dearly
beloved
of
my
soul
into
the
hand
of
her
enemies.
012:008
Mine
heritage
is
unto
me
as
a
lion
in
the
forest;
it
crieth
out
against
me:
therefore
have
I
hated
it.
012:009
Mine
heritage
is
unto
me
as
a
speckled
bird,
the
birds
round
about
are
against
her;
come
ye,
assemble
all
the
beasts
of
the
field,
come
to
devour.
012:010
Many
pastors
have
destroyed
my
vineyard,
they
have
trodden
my
portion
under
foot,
they
have
made
my
pleasant
portion
a
desolate
wilderness.
012:011
They
have
made
it
desolate,
and
being
desolate
it
mourneth
unto
me;
the
whole
land
is
made
desolate,
because
no
man
layeth
it
to
heart.
012:012
The
spoilers
are
come
upon
all
high
places
through
the
wilderness:
for
the
sword
of
the
LORD
shall
devour
from
the
one
end
of
the
land
even
to
the
other
end
of
the
land:
no
flesh
shall
have
peace.
012:013
They
have
sown
wheat,
but
shall
reap
thorns:
they
have
put
themselves
to
pain,
but
shall
not
profit:
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
of
your
revenues
because
of
the
fierce
anger
of
the
LORD.
012:014
Thus
saith
the
LORD
against
all
mine
evil
neighbours,
that
touch
the
inheritance
which
I
have
caused
my
people
Israel
to
inherit;
Behold,
I
will
pluck
them
out
of
their
land,
and
pluck
out
the
house
of
Judah
from
among
them.
012:015
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
after
that
I
have
plucked
them
out
I
will
return,
and
have
compassion
on
them,
and
will
bring
them
again,
every
man
to
his
heritage,
and
every
man
to
his
land.
012:016
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
they
will
diligently
learn
the
ways
of
my
people,
to
swear
by
my
name,
The
LORD
liveth;
as
they
taught
my
people
to
swear
by
Baal;
then
shall
they
be
built
in
the
midst
of
my
people.
012:017
But
if
they
will
not
obey,
I
will
utterly
pluck
up
and
destroy
that
nation,
saith
the
LORD.
013:001
Thus
saith
the
LORD
unto
me,
Go
and
get
thee
a
linen
girdle,
and
put
it
upon
thy
loins,
and
put
it
not
in
water.
013:002
So
I
got
a
girdle
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
and
put
it
on
my
loins.
013:003
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me
the
second
time,
saying,
013:004
Take
the
girdle
that
thou
hast
got,
which
is
upon
thy
loins,
and
arise,
go
to
Euphrates,
and
hide
it
there
in
a
hole
of
the
rock.
013:005
So
I
went,
and
hid
it
by
Euphrates,
as
the
LORD
commanded
me.
013:006
And
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days,
that
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Arise,
go
to
Euphrates,
and
take
the
girdle
from
thence,
which
I
commanded
thee
to
hide
there.
013:007
Then
I
went
to
Euphrates,
and
digged,
and
took
the
girdle
from
the
place
where
I
had
hid
it:
and,
behold,
the
girdle
was
marred,
it
was
profitable
for
nothing.
013:008
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
013:009
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
After
this
manner
will
I
mar
the
pride
of
Judah,
and
the
great
pride
of
Jerusalem.
013:010
This
evil
people,
which
refuse
to
hear
my
words,
which
walk
in
the
imagination
of
their
heart,
and
walk
after
other
gods,
to
serve
them,
and
to
worship
them,
shall
even
be
as
this
girdle,
which
is
good
for
nothing.
013:011
For
as
the
girdle
cleaveth
to
the
loins
of
a
man,
so
have
I
caused
to
cleave
unto
me
the
whole
house
of
Israel
and
the
whole
house
of
Judah,
saith
the
LORD;
that
they
might
be
unto
me
for
a
people,
and
for
a
name,
and
for
a
praise,
and
for
a
glory:
but
they
would
not
hear.
013:012
Therefore
thou
shalt
speak
unto
them
this
word;
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Every
bottle
shall
be
filled
with
wine:
and
they
shall
say
unto
thee,
Do
we
not
certainly
know
that
every
bottle
shall
be
filled
with
wine?
013:013
Then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
fill
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
land,
even
the
kings
that
sit
upon
David's
throne,
and
the
priests,
and
the
prophets,
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
with
drunkenness.
013:014
And
I
will
dash
them
one
against
another,
even
the
fathers
and
the
sons
together,
saith
the
LORD:
I
will
not
pity,
nor
spare,
nor
have
mercy,
but
destroy
them.
013:015
Hear
ye,
and
give
ear;
be
not
proud:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken.
013:016
Give
glory
to
the
LORD
your
God,
before
he
cause
darkness,
and
before
your
feet
stumble
upon
the
dark
mountains,
and,
while
ye
look
for
light,
he
turn
it
into
the
shadow
of
death,
and
make
it
gross
darkness.
013:017
But
if
ye
will
not
hear
it,
my
soul
shall
weep
in
secret
places
for
your
pride;
and
mine
eye
shall
weep
sore,
and
run
down
with
tears,
because
the
LORD's
flock
is
carried
away
captive.
013:018
Say
unto
the
king
and
to
the
queen,
Humble
yourselves,
sit
down:
for
your
principalities
shall
come
down,
even
the
crown
of
your
glory.
013:019
The
cities
of
the
south
shall
be
shut
up,
and
none
shall
open
them:
Judah
shall
be
carried
away
captive
all
of
it,
it
shall
be
wholly
carried
away
captive.
013:020
Lift
up
your
eyes,
and
behold
them
that
come
from
the
north:
where
is
the
flock
that
was
given
thee,
thy
beautiful
flock?
013:021
What
wilt
thou
say
when
he
shall
punish
thee?
for
thou
hast
taught
them
to
be
captains,
and
as
chief
over
thee:
shall
not
sorrows
take
thee,
as
a
woman
in
travail?
013:022
And
if
thou
say
in
thine
heart,
Wherefore
come
these
things
upon
me?
For
the
greatness
of
thine
iniquity
are
thy
skirts
discovered,
and
thy
heels
made
bare.
013:023
Can
the
Ethiopian
change
his
skin,
or
the
leopard
his
spots?
then
may
ye
also
do
good,
that
are
accustomed
to
do
evil.
013:024
Therefore
will
I
scatter
them
as
the
stubble
that
passeth
away
by
the
wind
of
the
wilderness.
013:025
This
is
thy
lot,
the
portion
of
thy
measures
from
me,
saith
the
LORD;
because
thou
hast
forgotten
me,
and
trusted
in
falsehood.
013:026
Therefore
will
I
discover
thy
skirts
upon
thy
face,
that
thy
shame
may
appear.
013:027
I
have
seen
thine
adulteries,
and
thy
neighings,
the
lewdness
of
thy
whoredom,
and
thine
abominations
on
the
hills
in
the
fields.
Woe
unto
thee,
O
Jerusalem!
wilt
thou
not
be
made
clean?
when
shall
it
once
be?
014:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
that
came
to
Jeremiah
concerning
the
dearth.
014:002
Judah
mourneth,
and
the
gates
thereof
languish;
they
are
black
unto
the
ground;
and
the
cry
of
Jerusalem
is
gone
up.
014:003
And
their
nobles
have
sent
their
little
ones
to
the
waters:
they
came
to
the
pits,
and
found
no
water;
they
returned
with
their
vessels
empty;
they
were
ashamed
and
confounded,
and
covered
their
heads.
014:004
Because
the
ground
is
chapt,
for
there
was
no
rain
in
the
earth,
the
plowmen
were
ashamed,
they
covered
their
heads.
014:005
Yea,
the
hind
also
calved
in
the
field,
and
forsook
it,
because
there
was
no
grass.
014:006
And
the
wild
asses
did
stand
in
the
high
places,
they
snuffed
up
the
wind
like
dragons;
their
eyes
did
fail,
because
there
was
no
grass.
014:007
O
LORD,
though
our
iniquities
testify
against
us,
do
thou
it
for
thy
name's
sake:
for
our
backslidings
are
many;
we
have
sinned
against
thee.
014:008
O
the
hope
of
Israel,
the
saviour
thereof
in
time
of
trouble,
why
shouldest
thou
be
as
a
stranger
in
the
land,
and
as
a
wayfaring
man
that
turneth
aside
to
tarry
for
a
night?
014:009
Why
shouldest
thou
be
as
a
man
astonied,
as
a
mighty
man
that
cannot
save?
yet
thou,
O
LORD,
art
in
the
midst
of
us,
and
we
are
called
by
thy
name;
leave
us
not.
014:010
Thus
saith
the
LORD
unto
this
people,
Thus
have
they
loved
to
wander,
they
have
not
refrained
their
feet,
therefore
the
LORD
doth
not
accept
them;
he
will
now
remember
their
iniquity,
and
visit
their
sins.
014:011
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
me,
Pray
not
for
this
people
for
their
good.
014:012
When
they
fast,
I
will
not
hear
their
cry;
and
when
they
offer
burnt
offering
and
an
oblation,
I
will
not
accept
them:
but
I
will
consume
them
by
the
sword,
and
by
the
famine,
and
by
the
pestilence.
014:013
Then
said
I,
Ah,
Lord
GOD!
behold,
the
prophets
say
unto
them,
Ye
shall
not
see
the
sword,
neither
shall
ye
have
famine;
but
I
will
give
you
assured
peace
in
this
place.
014:014
Then
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
The
prophets
prophesy
lies
in
my
name:
I
sent
them
not,
neither
have
I
commanded
them,
neither
spake
unto
them:
they
prophesy
unto
you
a
false
vision
and
divination,
and
a
thing
of
nought,
and
the
deceit
of
their
heart.
014:015
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
concerning
the
prophets
that
prophesy
in
my
name,
and
I
sent
them
not,
yet
they
say,
Sword
and
famine
shall
not
be
in
this
land;
By
sword
and
famine
shall
those
prophets
be
consumed.
014:016
And
the
people
to
whom
they
prophesy
shall
be
cast
out
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
because
of
the
famine
and
the
sword;
and
they
shall
have
none
to
bury
them,
them,
their
wives,
nor
their
sons,
nor
their
daughters:
for
I
will
pour
their
wickedness
upon
them.
014:017
Therefore
