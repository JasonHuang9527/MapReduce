thou
shalt
say
this
word
unto
them;
Let
mine
eyes
run
down
with
tears
night
and
day,
and
let
them
not
cease:
for
the
virgin
daughter
of
my
people
is
broken
with
a
great
breach,
with
a
very
grievous
blow.
014:018
If
I
go
forth
into
the
field,
then
behold
the
slain
with
the
sword!
and
if
I
enter
into
the
city,
then
behold
them
that
are
sick
with
famine!
yea,
both
the
prophet
and
the
priest
go
about
into
a
land
that
they
know
not.
014:019
Hast
thou
utterly
rejected
Judah?
hath
thy
soul
lothed
Zion?
why
hast
thou
smitten
us,
and
there
is
no
healing
for
us?
we
looked
for
peace,
and
there
is
no
good;
and
for
the
time
of
healing,
and
behold
trouble!
014:020
We
acknowledge,
O
LORD,
our
wickedness,
and
the
iniquity
of
our
fathers:
for
we
have
sinned
against
thee.
014:021
Do
not
abhor
us,
for
thy
name's
sake,
do
not
disgrace
the
throne
of
thy
glory:
remember,
break
not
thy
covenant
with
us.
014:022
Are
there
any
among
the
vanities
of
the
Gentiles
that
can
cause
rain?
or
can
the
heavens
give
showers?
art
not
thou
he,
O
LORD
our
God?
therefore
we
will
wait
upon
thee:
for
thou
hast
made
all
these
things.
015:001
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
me,
Though
Moses
and
Samuel
stood
before
me,
yet
my
mind
could
not
be
toward
this
people:
cast
them
out
of
my
sight,
and
let
them
go
forth.
015:002
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
they
say
unto
thee,
Whither
shall
we
go
forth?
then
thou
shalt
tell
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Such
as
are
for
death,
to
death;
and
such
as
are
for
the
sword,
to
the
sword;
and
such
as
are
for
the
famine,
to
the
famine;
and
such
as
are
for
the
captivity,
to
the
captivity.
015:003
And
I
will
appoint
over
them
four
kinds,
saith
the
LORD:
the
sword
to
slay,
and
the
dogs
to
tear,
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven,
and
the
beasts
of
the
earth,
to
devour
and
destroy.
015:004
And
I
will
cause
them
to
be
removed
into
all
kingdoms
of
the
earth,
because
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah,
for
that
which
he
did
in
Jerusalem.
015:005
For
who
shall
have
pity
upon
thee,
O
Jerusalem?
or
who
shall
bemoan
thee?
or
who
shall
go
aside
to
ask
how
thou
doest?
015:006
Thou
hast
forsaken
me,
saith
the
LORD,
thou
art
gone
backward:
therefore
will
I
stretch
out
my
hand
against
thee,
and
destroy
thee;
I
am
weary
with
repenting.
015:007
And
I
will
fan
them
with
a
fan
in
the
gates
of
the
land;
I
will
bereave
them
of
children,
I
will
destroy
my
people
since
they
return
not
from
their
ways.
015:008
Their
widows
are
increased
to
me
above
the
sand
of
the
seas:
I
have
brought
upon
them
against
the
mother
of
the
young
men
a
spoiler
at
noonday:
I
have
caused
him
to
fall
upon
it
suddenly,
and
terrors
upon
the
city.
015:009
She
that
hath
borne
seven
languisheth:
she
hath
given
up
the
ghost;
her
sun
is
gone
down
while
it
was
yet
day:
she
hath
been
ashamed
and
confounded:
and
the
residue
of
them
will
I
deliver
to
the
sword
before
their
enemies,
saith
the
LORD.
015:010
Woe
is
me,
my
mother,
that
thou
hast
borne
me
a
man
of
strife
and
a
man
of
contention
to
the
whole
earth!
I
have
neither
lent
on
usury,
nor
men
have
lent
to
me
on
usury;
yet
every
one
of
them
doth
curse
me.
015:011
The
LORD
said,
Verily
it
shall
be
well
with
thy
remnant;
verily
I
will
cause
the
enemy
to
entreat
thee
well
in
the
time
of
evil
and
in
the
time
of
affliction.
015:012
Shall
iron
break
the
northern
iron
and
the
steel?
015:013
Thy
substance
and
thy
treasures
will
I
give
to
the
spoil
without
price,
and
that
for
all
thy
sins,
even
in
all
thy
borders.
015:014
And
I
will
make
thee
to
pass
with
thine
enemies
into
a
land
which
thou
knowest
not:
for
a
fire
is
kindled
in
mine
anger,
which
shall
burn
upon
you.
015:015
O
LORD,
thou
knowest:
remember
me,
and
visit
me,
and
revenge
me
of
my
persecutors;
take
me
not
away
in
thy
longsuffering:
know
that
for
thy
sake
I
have
suffered
rebuke.
015:016
Thy
words
were
found,
and
I
did
eat
them;
and
thy
word
was
unto
me
the
joy
and
rejoicing
of
mine
heart:
for
I
am
called
by
thy
name,
O
LORD
God
of
hosts.
015:017
I
sat
not
in
the
assembly
of
the
mockers,
nor
rejoiced;
I
sat
alone
because
of
thy
hand:
for
thou
hast
filled
me
with
indignation.
015:018
Why
is
my
pain
perpetual,
and
my
wound
incurable,
which
refuseth
to
be
healed?
wilt
thou
be
altogether
unto
me
as
a
liar,
and
as
waters
that
fail?
015:019
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD,
If
thou
return,
then
will
I
bring
thee
again,
and
thou
shalt
stand
before
me:
and
if
thou
take
forth
the
precious
from
the
vile,
thou
shalt
be
as
my
mouth:
let
them
return
unto
thee;
but
return
not
thou
unto
them.
015:020
And
I
will
make
thee
unto
this
people
a
fenced
brasen
wall:
and
they
shall
fight
against
thee,
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
thee:
for
I
am
with
thee
to
save
thee
and
to
deliver
thee,
saith
the
LORD.
015:021
And
I
will
deliver
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked,
and
I
will
redeem
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
the
terrible.
016:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
also
unto
me,
saying,
016:002
Thou
shalt
not
take
thee
a
wife,
neither
shalt
thou
have
sons
or
daughters
in
this
place.
016:003
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
concerning
the
sons
and
concerning
the
daughters
that
are
born
in
this
place,
and
concerning
their
mothers
that
bare
them,
and
concerning
their
fathers
that
begat
them
in
this
land;
016:004
They
shall
die
of
grievous
deaths;
they
shall
not
be
lamented;
neither
shall
they
be
buried;
but
they
shall
be
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
earth:
and
they
shall
be
consumed
by
the
sword,
and
by
famine;
and
their
carcases
shall
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
heaven,
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth.
016:005
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Enter
not
into
the
house
of
mourning,
neither
go
to
lament
nor
bemoan
them:
for
I
have
taken
away
my
peace
from
this
people,
saith
the
LORD,
even
lovingkindness
and
mercies.
016:006
Both
the
great
and
the
small
shall
die
in
this
land:
they
shall
not
be
buried,
neither
shall
men
lament
for
them,
nor
cut
themselves,
nor
make
themselves
bald
for
them:
016:007
Neither
shall
men
tear
themselves
for
them
in
mourning,
to
comfort
them
for
the
dead;
neither
shall
men
give
them
the
cup
of
consolation
to
drink
for
their
father
or
for
their
mother.
016:008
Thou
shalt
not
also
go
into
the
house
of
feasting,
to
sit
with
them
to
eat
and
to
drink.
016:009
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Behold,
I
will
cause
to
cease
out
of
this
place
in
your
eyes,
and
in
your
days,
the
voice
of
mirth,
and
the
voice
of
gladness,
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom,
and
the
voice
of
the
bride.
016:010
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
thou
shalt
shew
this
people
all
these
words,
and
they
shall
say
unto
thee,
Wherefore
hath
the
LORD
pronounced
all
this
great
evil
against
us?
or
what
is
our
iniquity?
or
what
is
our
sin
that
we
have
committed
against
the
LORD
our
God?
016:011
Then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them,
Because
your
fathers
have
forsaken
me,
saith
the
LORD,
and
have
walked
after
other
gods,
and
have
served
them,
and
have
worshipped
them,
and
have
forsaken
me,
and
have
not
kept
my
law;
016:012
And
ye
have
done
worse
than
your
fathers;
for,
behold,
ye
walk
every
one
after
the
imagination
of
his
evil
heart,
that
they
may
not
hearken
unto
me:
016:013
Therefore
will
I
cast
you
out
of
this
land
into
a
land
that
ye
know
not,
neither
ye
nor
your
fathers;
and
there
shall
ye
serve
other
gods
day
and
night;
where
I
will
not
shew
you
favour.
016:014
Therefore,
behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
it
shall
no
more
be
said,
The
LORD
liveth,
that
brought
up
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt;
016:015
But,
The
LORD
liveth,
that
brought
up
the
children
of
Israel
from
the
land
of
the
north,
and
from
all
the
lands
whither
he
had
driven
them:
and
I
will
bring
them
again
into
their
land
that
I
gave
unto
their
fathers.
016:016
Behold,
I
will
send
for
many
fishers,
saith
the
LORD,
and
they
shall
fish
them;
and
after
will
I
send
for
many
hunters,
and
they
shall
hunt
them
from
every
mountain,
and
from
every
hill,
and
out
of
the
holes
of
the
rocks.
016:017
For
mine
eyes
are
upon
all
their
ways:
they
are
not
hid
from
my
face,
neither
is
their
iniquity
hid
from
mine
eyes.
016:018
And
first
I
will
recompense
their
iniquity
and
their
sin
double;
because
they
have
defiled
my
land,
they
have
filled
mine
inheritance
with
the
carcases
of
their
detestable
and
abominable
things.
016:019
O
LORD,
my
strength,
and
my
fortress,
and
my
refuge
in
the
day
of
affliction,
the
Gentiles
shall
come
unto
thee
from
the
ends
of
the
earth,
and
shall
say,
Surely
our
fathers
have
inherited
lies,
vanity,
and
things
wherein
there
is
no
profit.
016:020
Shall
a
man
make
gods
unto
himself,
and
they
are
no
gods?
016:021
Therefore,
behold,
I
will
this
once
cause
them
to
know,
I
will
cause
them
to
know
mine
hand
and
my
might;
and
they
shall
know
that
my
name
is
The
LORD.
017:001
The
sin
of
Judah
is
written
with
a
pen
of
iron,
and
with
the
point
of
a
diamond:
it
is
graven
upon
the
table
of
their
heart,
and
upon
the
horns
of
your
altars;
017:002
Whilst
their
children
remember
their
altars
and
their
groves
by
the
green
trees
upon
the
high
hills.
017:003
O
my
mountain
in
the
field,
I
will
give
thy
substance
and
all
thy
treasures
to
the
spoil,
and
thy
high
places
for
sin,
throughout
all
thy
borders.
017:004
And
thou,
even
thyself,
shalt
discontinue
from
thine
heritage
that
I
gave
thee;
and
I
will
cause
thee
to
serve
thine
enemies
in
the
land
which
thou
knowest
not:
for
ye
have
kindled
a
fire
in
mine
anger,
which
shall
burn
for
ever.
017:005
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Cursed
be
the
man
that
trusteth
in
man,
and
maketh
flesh
his
arm,
and
whose
heart
departeth
from
the
LORD.
017:006
For
he
shall
be
like
the
heath
in
the
desert,
and
shall
not
see
when
good
cometh;
but
shall
inhabit
the
parched
places
in
the
wilderness,
in
a
salt
land
and
not
inhabited.
017:007
Blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
the
LORD,
and
whose
hope
the
LORD
is.
017:008
For
he
shall
be
as
a
tree
planted
by
the
waters,
and
that
spreadeth
out
her
roots
by
the
river,
and
shall
not
see
when
heat
cometh,
but
her
leaf
shall
be
green;
and
shall
not
be
careful
in
the
year
of
drought,
neither
shall
cease
from
yielding
fruit.
017:009
The
heart
is
deceitful
above
all
things,
and
desperately
wicked:
who
can
know
it?
017:010
I
the
LORD
search
the
heart,
I
try
the
reins,
even
to
give
every
man
according
to
his
ways,
and
according
to
the
fruit
of
his
doings.
017:011
As
the
partridge
sitteth
on
eggs,
and
hatcheth
them
not;
so
he
that
getteth
riches,
and
not
by
right,
shall
leave
them
in
the
midst
of
his
days,
and
at
his
end
shall
be
a
fool.
017:012
A
glorious
high
throne
from
the
beginning
is
the
place
of
our
sanctuary.
017:013
O
LORD,
the
hope
of
Israel,
all
that
forsake
thee
shall
be
ashamed,
and
they
that
depart
from
me
shall
be
written
in
the
earth,
because
they
have
forsaken
the
LORD,
the
fountain
of
living
waters.
017:014
Heal
me,
O
LORD,
and
I
shall
be
healed;
save
me,
and
I
shall
be
saved:
for
thou
art
my
praise.
017:015
Behold,
they
say
unto
me,
Where
is
the
word
of
the
LORD?
let
it
come
now.
017:016
As
for
me,
I
have
not
hastened
from
being
a
pastor
to
follow
thee:
neither
have
I
desired
the
woeful
day;
thou
knowest:
that
which
came
out
of
my
lips
was
right
before
thee.
017:017
Be
not
a
terror
unto
me:
thou
art
my
hope
in
the
day
of
evil.
017:018
Let
them
be
confounded
that
persecute
me,
but
let
not
me
be
confounded:
let
them
be
dismayed,
but
let
not
me
be
dismayed:
bring
upon
them
the
day
of
evil,
and
destroy
them
with
double
destruction.
017:019
Thus
said
the
LORD
unto
me;
Go
and
stand
in
the
gate
of
the
children
of
the
people,
whereby
the
kings
of
Judah
come
in,
and
by
the
which
they
go
out,
and
in
all
the
gates
of
Jerusalem;
017:020
And
say
unto
them,
Hear
ye
the
word
of
the
LORD,
ye
kings
of
Judah,
and
all
Judah,
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
that
enter
in
by
these
gates:
017:021
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Take
heed
to
yourselves,
and
bear
no
burden
on
the
sabbath
day,
nor
bring
it
in
by
the
gates
of
Jerusalem;
017:022
Neither
carry
forth
a
burden
out
of
your
houses
on
the
sabbath
day,
neither
do
ye
any
work,
but
hallow
ye
the
sabbath
day,
as
I
commanded
your
fathers.
017:023
But
they
obeyed
not,
neither
inclined
their
ear,
but
made
their
neck
stiff,
that
they
might
not
hear,
nor
receive
instruction.
017:024
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
ye
diligently
hearken
unto
me,
saith
the
LORD,
to
bring
in
no
burden
through
the
gates
of
this
city
on
the
sabbath
day,
but
hallow
the
sabbath
day,
to
do
no
work
therein;
017:025
Then
shall
there
enter
into
the
gates
of
this
city
kings
and
princes
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
David,
riding
in
chariots
and
on
horses,
they,
and
their
princes,
the
men
of
Judah,
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem:
and
this
city
shall
remain
for
ever.
017:026
And
they
shall
come
from
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
from
the
places
about
Jerusalem,
and
from
the
land
of
Benjamin,
and
from
the
plain,
and
from
the
mountains,
and
from
the
south,
bringing
burnt
offerings,
and
sacrifices,
and
meat
offerings,
and
incense,
and
bringing
sacrifices
of
praise,
unto
the
house
of
the
LORD.
017:027
But
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
me
to
hallow
the
sabbath
day,
and
not
to
bear
a
burden,
even
entering
in
at
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
on
the
sabbath
day;
then
will
I
kindle
a
fire
in
the
gates
thereof,
and
it
shall
devour
the
palaces
of
Jerusalem,
and
it
shall
not
be
quenched.
018:001
The
word
which
came
to
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
saying,
018:002
Arise,
and
go
down
to
the
potter's
house,
and
there
I
will
cause
thee
to
hear
my
words.
018:003
Then
I
went
down
to
the
potter's
house,
and,
behold,
he
wrought
a
work
on
the
wheels.
018:004
And
the
vessel
that
he
made
of
clay
was
marred
in
the
hand
of
the
potter:
so
he
made
it
again
another
vessel,
as
seemed
good
to
the
potter
to
make
it.
018:005
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
me,
saying,
018:006
O
house
of
Israel,
cannot
I
do
with
you
as
this
potter?
saith
the
LORD.
Behold,
as
the
clay
is
in
the
potter's
hand,
so
are
ye
in
mine
hand,
O
house
of
Israel.
018:007
At
what
instant
I
shall
speak
concerning
a
nation,
and
concerning
a
kingdom,
to
pluck
up,
and
to
pull
down,
and
to
destroy
it;
018:008
If
that
nation,
against
whom
I
have
pronounced,
turn
from
their
evil,
I
will
repent
of
the
evil
that
I
thought
to
do
unto
them.
018:009
And
at
what
instant
I
shall
speak
concerning
a
nation,
and
concerning
a
kingdom,
to
build
and
to
plant
it;
018:010
If
it
do
evil
in
my
sight,
that
it
obey
not
my
voice,
then
I
will
repent
of
the
good,
wherewith
I
said
I
would
benefit
them.
018:011
Now
therefore
go
to,
speak
to
the
men
of
Judah,
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
frame
evil
against
you,
and
devise
a
device
against
you:
return
ye
now
every
one
from
his
evil
way,
and
make
your
ways
and
your
doings
good.
018:012
And
they
said,
There
is
no
hope:
but
we
will
walk
after
our
own
devices,
and
we
will
every
one
do
the
imagination
of
his
evil
heart.
018:013
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Ask
ye
now
among
the
heathen,
who
hath
heard
such
things:
the
virgin
of
Israel
hath
done
a
very
horrible
thing.
018:014
Will
a
man
leave
the
snow
of
Lebanon
which
cometh
from
the
rock
of
the
field?
or
shall
the
cold
flowing
waters
that
come
from
another
place
be
forsaken?
018:015
Because
my
people
hath
forgotten
me,
they
have
burned
incense
to
vanity,
and
they
have
caused
them
to
stumble
in
their
ways
from
the
ancient
paths,
to
walk
in
paths,
in
a
way
not
cast
up;
018:016
To
make
their
land
desolate,
and
a
perpetual
hissing;
every
one
that
passeth
thereby
shall
be
astonished,
and
wag
his
head.
018:017
I
will
scatter
them
as
with
an
east
wind
before
the
enemy;
I
will
shew
them
the
back,
and
not
the
face,
in
the
day
of
their
calamity.
018:018
Then
said
they,
Come
and
let
us
devise
devices
against
Jeremiah;
for
the
law
shall
not
perish
from
the
priest,
nor
counsel
from
the
wise,
nor
the
word
from
the
prophet.
Come,
and
let
us
smite
him
with
the
tongue,
and
let
us
not
give
heed
to
any
of
his
words.
018:019
Give
heed
to
me,
O
LORD,
and
hearken
to
the
voice
of
them
that
contend
with
me.
018:020
Shall
evil
be
recompensed
for
good?
for
they
have
digged
a
pit
for
my
soul.
Remember
that
I
stood
before
thee
to
speak
good
for
them,
and
to
turn
away
thy
wrath
from
them.
018:021
Therefore
deliver
up
their
children
to
the
famine,
and
pour
out
their
blood
by
the
force
of
the
sword;
and
let
their
wives
be
bereaved
of
their
children,
and
be
widows;
and
let
their
men
be
put
to
death;
let
their
young
men
be
slain
by
the
sword
in
battle.
018:022
Let
a
cry
be
heard
from
their
houses,
when
thou
shalt
bring
a
troop
suddenly
upon
them:
for
they
have
digged
a
pit
to
take
me,
and
hid
snares
for
my
feet.
018:023
Yet,
LORD,
thou
knowest
all
their
counsel
against
me
to
slay
me:
forgive
not
their
iniquity,
neither
blot
out
their
sin
from
thy
sight,
but
let
them
be
overthrown
before
thee;
deal
thus
with
them
in
the
time
of
thine
anger.
019:001
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Go
and
get
a
potter's
earthen
bottle,
and
take
of
the
ancients
of
the
people,
and
of
the
ancients
of
the
priests;
019:002
And
go
forth
unto
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
which
is
by
the
entry
of
the
east
gate,
and
proclaim
there
the
words
that
I
shall
tell
thee,
019:003
And
say,
Hear
ye
the
word
of
the
LORD,
O
kings
of
Judah,
and
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem;
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Behold,
I
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place,
the
which
whosoever
heareth,
his
ears
shall
tingle.
019:004
Because
they
have
forsaken
me,
and
have
estranged
this
place,
and
have
burned
incense
in
it
unto
other
gods,
whom
neither
they
nor
their
fathers
have
known,
nor
the
kings
of
Judah,
and
have
filled
this
place
with
the
blood
of
innocents;
019:005
They
have
built
also
the
high
places
of
Baal,
to
burn
their
sons
with
fire
for
burnt
offerings
unto
Baal,
which
I
commanded
not,
nor
spake
it,
neither
came
it
into
my
mind:
019:006
Therefore,
behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
this
place
shall
no
more
be
called
Tophet,
nor
The
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
but
The
valley
of
slaughter.
019:007
And
I
will
make
void
the
counsel
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
in
this
place;
and
I
will
cause
them
to
fall
by
the
sword
before
their
enemies,
and
by
the
hands
of
them
that
seek
their
lives:
and
their
carcases
will
I
give
to
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
the
heaven,
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth.
019:008
And
I
will
make
this
city
desolate,
and
an
hissing;
every
one
that
passeth
thereby
shall
be
astonished
and
hiss
because
of
all
the
plagues
thereof.
019:009
And
I
will
cause
them
to
eat
the
flesh
of
their
sons
and
the
flesh
of
their
daughters,
and
they
shall
eat
every
one
the
flesh
of
his
friend
in
the
siege
and
straitness,
wherewith
their
enemies,
and
they
that
seek
their
lives,
shall
straiten
them.
019:010
Then
shalt
thou
break
the
bottle
in
the
sight
of
the
men
that
go
with
thee,
019:011
And
shalt
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Even
so
will
I
break
this
people
and
this
city,
as
one
breaketh
a
potter's
vessel,
that
cannot
be
made
whole
again:
and
they
shall
bury
them
in
Tophet,
till
there
be
no
place
to
bury.
019:012
Thus
will
I
do
unto
this
place,
saith
the
LORD,
and
to
the
inhabitants
thereof,
and
even
make
this
city
as
Tophet:
019:013
And
the
houses
of
Jerusalem,
and
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
Judah,
shall
be
defiled
as
the
place
of
Tophet,
because
of
all
the
houses
upon
whose
roofs
they
have
burned
incense
unto
all
the
host
of
heaven,
and
have
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods.
019:014
Then
came
Jeremiah
from
Tophet,
whither
the
LORD
had
sent
him
to
prophesy;
and
he
stood
in
the
court
of
the
LORD's
house;
and
said
to
all
the
people,
019:015
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Behold,
I
will
bring
upon
this
city
and
upon
all
her
towns
all
the
evil
that
I
have
pronounced
against
it,
because
they
have
hardened
their
necks,
that
they
might
not
hear
my
words.
020:001
Now
Pashur
the
son
of
Immer
the
priest,
who
was
also
chief
governor
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
heard
that
Jeremiah
prophesied
these
things.
020:002
Then
Pashur
smote
Jeremiah
the
prophet,
and
put
him
in
the
stocks
that
were
in
the
high
gate
of
Benjamin,
which
was
by
the
house
of
the
LORD.
020:003
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
Pashur
brought
forth
Jeremiah
out
of
the
stocks.
Then
said
Jeremiah
unto
him,
The
LORD
hath
not
called
thy
name
Pashur,
but
Magormissabib.
020:004
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
make
thee
a
terror
to
thyself,
and
to
all
thy
friends:
and
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
of
their
enemies,
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
it:
and
I
will
give
all
Judah
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
he
shall
carry
them
captive
into
Babylon,
and
shall
slay
them
with
the
sword.
020:005
Moreover
I
will
deliver
all
the
strength
of
this
city,
and
all
the
labours
thereof,
and
all
the
precious
things
thereof,
and
all
the
treasures
of
the
kings
of
Judah
will
I
give
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies,
which
shall
spoil
them,
and
take
them,
and
carry
them
to
Babylon.
020:006
And
thou,
Pashur,
and
all
that
dwell
in
thine
house
shall
go
into
captivity:
and
thou
shalt
come
to
Babylon,
and
there
thou
shalt
die,
and
shalt
be
buried
there,
thou,
and
all
thy
friends,
to
whom
thou
hast
prophesied
lies.
020:007
O
LORD,
thou
hast
deceived
me,
and
I
was
deceived;
thou
art
stronger
than
I,
and
hast
prevailed:
I
am
in
derision
daily,
every
one
mocketh
me.
020:008
For
since
I
spake,
I
cried
out,
I
cried
violence
and
spoil;
because
the
word
of
the
LORD
was
made
a
reproach
unto
me,
and
a
derision,
daily.
020:009
Then
I
said,
I
will
not
make
mention
of
him,
nor
speak
any
more
in
his
name.
But
his
word
was
in
mine
heart
as
a
burning
fire
shut
up
in
my
bones,
and
I
was
weary
with
forbearing,
and
I
could
not
