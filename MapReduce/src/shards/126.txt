stay.
020:010
For
I
heard
the
defaming
of
many,
fear
on
every
side.
Report,
say
they,
and
we
will
report
it.
All
my
familiars
watched
for
my
halting,
saying,
Peradventure
he
will
be
enticed,
and
we
shall
prevail
against
him,
and
we
shall
take
our
revenge
on
him.
020:011
But
the
LORD
is
with
me
as
a
mighty
terrible
one:
therefore
my
persecutors
shall
stumble,
and
they
shall
not
prevail:
they
shall
be
greatly
ashamed;
for
they
shall
not
prosper:
their
everlasting
confusion
shall
never
be
forgotten.
020:012
But,
O
LORD
of
hosts,
that
triest
the
righteous,
and
seest
the
reins
and
the
heart,
let
me
see
thy
vengeance
on
them:
for
unto
thee
have
I
opened
my
cause.
020:013
Sing
unto
the
LORD,
praise
ye
the
LORD:
for
he
hath
delivered
the
soul
of
the
poor
from
the
hand
of
evildoers.
020:014
Cursed
be
the
day
wherein
I
was
born:
let
not
the
day
wherein
my
mother
bare
me
be
blessed.
020:015
Cursed
be
the
man
who
brought
tidings
to
my
father,
saying,
A
man
child
is
born
unto
thee;
making
him
very
glad.
020:016
And
let
that
man
be
as
the
cities
which
the
LORD
overthrew,
and
repented
not:
and
let
him
hear
the
cry
in
the
morning,
and
the
shouting
at
noontide;
020:017
Because
he
slew
me
not
from
the
womb;
or
that
my
mother
might
have
been
my
grave,
and
her
womb
to
be
always
great
with
me.
020:018
Wherefore
came
I
forth
out
of
the
womb
to
see
labour
and
sorrow,
that
my
days
should
be
consumed
with
shame?
021:001
The
word
which
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
when
king
Zedekiah
sent
unto
him
Pashur
the
son
of
Melchiah,
and
Zephaniah
the
son
of
Maaseiah
the
priest,
saying,
021:002
Enquire,
I
pray
thee,
of
the
LORD
for
us;
for
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
maketh
war
against
us;
if
so
be
that
the
LORD
will
deal
with
us
according
to
all
his
wondrous
works,
that
he
may
go
up
from
us.
021:003
Then
said
Jeremiah
unto
them,
Thus
shall
ye
say
to
Zedekiah:
021:004
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel;
Behold,
I
will
turn
back
the
weapons
of
war
that
are
in
your
hands,
wherewith
ye
fight
against
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
against
the
Chaldeans,
which
besiege
you
without
the
walls,
and
I
will
assemble
them
into
the
midst
of
this
city.
021:005
And
I
myself
will
fight
against
you
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
with
a
strong
arm,
even
in
anger,
and
in
fury,
and
in
great
wrath.
021:006
And
I
will
smite
the
inhabitants
of
this
city,
both
man
and
beast:
they
shall
die
of
a
great
pestilence.
021:007
And
afterward,
saith
the
LORD,
I
will
deliver
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah,
and
his
servants,
and
the
people,
and
such
as
are
left
in
this
city
from
the
pestilence,
from
the
sword,
and
from
the
famine,
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon,
and
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies,
and
into
the
hand
of
those
that
seek
their
life:
and
he
shall
smite
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword;
he
shall
not
spare
them,
neither
have
pity,
nor
have
mercy.
021:008
And
unto
this
people
thou
shalt
say,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
set
before
you
the
way
of
life,
and
the
way
of
death.
021:009
He
that
abideth
in
this
city
shall
die
by
the
sword,
and
by
the
famine,
and
by
the
pestilence:
but
he
that
goeth
out,
and
falleth
to
the
Chaldeans
that
besiege
you,
he
shall
live,
and
his
life
shall
be
unto
him
for
a
prey.
021:010
For
I
have
set
my
face
against
this
city
for
evil,
and
not
for
good,
saith
the
LORD:
it
shall
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
he
shall
burn
it
with
fire.
021:011
And
touching
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah,
say,
Hear
ye
the
word
of
the
LORD;
021:012
O
house
of
David,
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Execute
judgment
in
the
morning,
and
deliver
him
that
is
spoiled
out
of
the
hand
of
the
oppressor,
lest
my
fury
go
out
like
fire,
and
burn
that
none
can
quench
it,
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings.
021:013
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
O
inhabitant
of
the
valley,
and
rock
of
the
plain,
saith
the
LORD;
which
say,
Who
shall
come
down
against
us?
or
who
shall
enter
into
our
habitations?
021:014
But
I
will
punish
you
according
to
the
fruit
of
your
doings,
saith
the
LORD:
and
I
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
forest
thereof,
and
it
shall
devour
all
things
round
about
it.
022:001
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Go
down
to
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah,
and
speak
there
this
word,
022:002
And
say,
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
O
king
of
Judah,
that
sittest
upon
the
throne
of
David,
thou,
and
thy
servants,
and
thy
people
that
enter
in
by
these
gates:
022:003
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Execute
ye
judgment
and
righteousness,
and
deliver
the
spoiled
out
of
the
hand
of
the
oppressor:
and
do
no
wrong,
do
no
violence
to
the
stranger,
the
fatherless,
nor
the
widow,
neither
shed
innocent
blood
in
this
place.
022:004
For
if
ye
do
this
thing
indeed,
then
shall
there
enter
in
by
the
gates
of
this
house
kings
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
David,
riding
in
chariots
and
on
horses,
he,
and
his
servants,
and
his
people.
022:005
But
if
ye
will
not
hear
these
words,
I
swear
by
myself,
saith
the
LORD,
that
this
house
shall
become
a
desolation.
022:006
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
unto
the
king's
house
of
Judah;
Thou
art
Gilead
unto
me,
and
the
head
of
Lebanon:
yet
surely
I
will
make
thee
a
wilderness,
and
cities
which
are
not
inhabited.
022:007
And
I
will
prepare
destroyers
against
thee,
every
one
with
his
weapons:
and
they
shall
cut
down
thy
choice
cedars,
and
cast
them
into
the
fire.
022:008
And
many
nations
shall
pass
by
this
city,
and
they
shall
say
every
man
to
his
neighbour,
Wherefore
hath
the
LORD
done
thus
unto
this
great
city?
022:009
Then
they
shall
answer,
Because
they
have
forsaken
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
their
God,
and
worshipped
other
gods,
and
served
them.
022:010
Weep
ye
not
for
the
dead,
neither
bemoan
him:
but
weep
sore
for
him
that
goeth
away:
for
he
shall
return
no
more,
nor
see
his
native
country.
022:011
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
touching
Shallum
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah,
which
reigned
instead
of
Josiah
his
father,
which
went
forth
out
of
this
place;
He
shall
not
return
thither
any
more:
022:012
But
he
shall
die
in
the
place
whither
they
have
led
him
captive,
and
shall
see
this
land
no
more.
022:013
Woe
unto
him
that
buildeth
his
house
by
unrighteousness,
and
his
chambers
by
wrong;
that
useth
his
neighbour's
service
without
wages,
and
giveth
him
not
for
his
work;
022:014
That
saith,
I
will
build
me
a
wide
house
and
large
chambers,
and
cutteth
him
out
windows;
and
it
is
cieled
with
cedar,
and
painted
with
vermilion.
022:015
Shalt
thou
reign,
because
thou
closest
thyself
in
cedar?
did
not
thy
father
eat
and
drink,
and
do
judgment
and
justice,
and
then
it
was
well
with
him?
022:016
He
judged
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
needy;
then
it
was
well
with
him:
was
not
this
to
know
me?
saith
the
LORD.
022:017
But
thine
eyes
and
thine
heart
are
not
but
for
thy
covetousness,
and
for
to
shed
innocent
blood,
and
for
oppression,
and
for
violence,
to
do
it.
022:018
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
concerning
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah;
They
shall
not
lament
for
him,
saying,
Ah
my
brother!
or,
Ah
sister!
they
shall
not
lament
for
him,
saying,
Ah
lord!
or,
Ah
his
glory!
022:019
He
shall
be
buried
with
the
burial
of
an
ass,
drawn
and
cast
forth
beyond
the
gates
of
Jerusalem.
022:020
Go
up
to
Lebanon,
and
cry;
and
lift
up
thy
voice
in
Bashan,
and
cry
from
the
passages:
for
all
thy
lovers
are
destroyed.
022:021
I
spake
unto
thee
in
thy
prosperity;
but
thou
saidst,
I
will
not
hear.
This
hath
been
thy
manner
from
thy
youth,
that
thou
obeyedst
not
my
voice.
022:022
The
wind
shall
eat
up
all
thy
pastors,
and
thy
lovers
shall
go
into
captivity:
surely
then
shalt
thou
be
ashamed
and
confounded
for
all
thy
wickedness.
022:023
O
inhabitant
of
Lebanon,
that
makest
thy
nest
in
the
cedars,
how
gracious
shalt
thou
be
when
pangs
come
upon
thee,
the
pain
as
of
a
woman
in
travail!
022:024
As
I
live,
saith
the
LORD,
though
Coniah
the
son
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah
were
the
signet
upon
my
right
hand,
yet
would
I
pluck
thee
thence;
022:025
And
I
will
give
thee
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
thy
life,
and
into
the
hand
of
them
whose
face
thou
fearest,
even
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon,
and
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans.
022:026
And
I
will
cast
thee
out,
and
thy
mother
that
bare
thee,
into
another
country,
where
ye
were
not
born;
and
there
shall
ye
die.
022:027
But
to
the
land
whereunto
they
desire
to
return,
thither
shall
they
not
return.
022:028
Is
this
man
Coniah
a
despised
broken
idol?
is
he
a
vessel
wherein
is
no
pleasure?
wherefore
are
they
cast
out,
he
and
his
seed,
and
are
cast
into
a
land
which
they
know
not?
022:029
O
earth,
earth,
earth,
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD.
022:030
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Write
ye
this
man
childless,
a
man
that
shall
not
prosper
in
his
days:
for
no
man
of
his
seed
shall
prosper,
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
David,
and
ruling
any
more
in
Judah.
023:001
Woe
be
unto
the
pastors
that
destroy
and
scatter
the
sheep
of
my
pasture!
saith
the
LORD.
023:002
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
against
the
pastors
that
feed
my
people;
Ye
have
scattered
my
flock,
and
driven
them
away,
and
have
not
visited
them:
behold,
I
will
visit
upon
you
the
evil
of
your
doings,
saith
the
LORD.
023:003
And
I
will
gather
the
remnant
of
my
flock
out
of
all
countries
whither
I
have
driven
them,
and
will
bring
them
again
to
their
folds;
and
they
shall
be
fruitful
and
increase.
023:004
And
I
will
set
up
shepherds
over
them
which
shall
feed
them:
and
they
shall
fear
no
more,
nor
be
dismayed,
neither
shall
they
be
lacking,
saith
the
LORD.
023:005
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
raise
unto
David
a
righteous
Branch,
and
a
King
shall
reign
and
prosper,
and
shall
execute
judgment
and
justice
in
the
earth.
023:006
In
his
days
Judah
shall
be
saved,
and
Israel
shall
dwell
safely:
and
this
is
his
name
whereby
he
shall
be
called,
THE
LORD
OUR
RIGHTEOUSNESS.
023:007
Therefore,
behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
they
shall
no
more
say,
The
LORD
liveth,
which
brought
up
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt;
023:008
But,
The
LORD
liveth,
which
brought
up
and
which
led
the
seed
of
the
house
of
Israel
out
of
the
north
country,
and
from
all
countries
whither
I
had
driven
them;
and
they
shall
dwell
in
their
own
land.
023:009
Mine
heart
within
me
is
broken
because
of
the
prophets;
all
my
bones
shake;
I
am
like
a
drunken
man,
and
like
a
man
whom
wine
hath
overcome,
because
of
the
LORD,
and
because
of
the
words
of
his
holiness.
023:010
For
the
land
is
full
of
adulterers;
for
because
of
swearing
the
land
mourneth;
the
pleasant
places
of
the
wilderness
are
dried
up,
and
their
course
is
evil,
and
their
force
is
not
right.
023:011
For
both
prophet
and
priest
are
profane;
yea,
in
my
house
have
I
found
their
wickedness,
saith
the
LORD.
023:012
Wherefore
their
way
shall
be
unto
them
as
slippery
ways
in
the
darkness:
they
shall
be
driven
on,
and
fall
therein:
for
I
will
bring
evil
upon
them,
even
the
year
of
their
visitation,
saith
the
LORD.
023:013
And
I
have
seen
folly
in
the
prophets
of
Samaria;
they
prophesied
in
Baal,
and
caused
my
people
Israel
to
err.
023:014
I
have
seen
also
in
the
prophets
of
Jerusalem
an
horrible
thing:
they
commit
adultery,
and
walk
in
lies:
they
strengthen
also
the
hands
of
evildoers,
that
none
doth
return
from
his
wickedness;
they
are
all
of
them
unto
me
as
Sodom,
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
as
Gomorrah.
023:015
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts
concerning
the
prophets;
Behold,
I
will
feed
them
with
wormwood,
and
make
them
drink
the
water
of
gall:
for
from
the
prophets
of
Jerusalem
is
profaneness
gone
forth
into
all
the
land.
023:016
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
Hearken
not
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you:
they
make
you
vain:
they
speak
a
vision
of
their
own
heart,
and
not
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
LORD.
023:017
They
say
still
unto
them
that
despise
me,
The
LORD
hath
said,
Ye
shall
have
peace;
and
they
say
unto
every
one
that
walketh
after
the
imagination
of
his
own
heart,
No
evil
shall
come
upon
you.
023:018
For
who
hath
stood
in
the
counsel
of
the
LORD,
and
hath
perceived
and
heard
his
word?
who
hath
marked
his
word,
and
heard
it?
023:019
Behold,
a
whirlwind
of
the
LORD
is
gone
forth
in
fury,
even
a
grievous
whirlwind:
it
shall
fall
grievously
upon
the
head
of
the
wicked.
023:020
The
anger
of
the
LORD
shall
not
return,
until
he
have
executed,
and
till
he
have
performed
the
thoughts
of
his
heart:
in
the
latter
days
ye
shall
consider
it
perfectly.
023:021
I
have
not
sent
these
prophets,
yet
they
ran:
I
have
not
spoken
to
them,
yet
they
prophesied.
023:022
But
if
they
had
stood
in
my
counsel,
and
had
caused
my
people
to
hear
my
words,
then
they
should
have
turned
them
from
their
evil
way,
and
from
the
evil
of
their
doings.
023:023
Am
I
a
God
at
hand,
saith
the
LORD,
and
not
a
God
afar
off?
023:024
Can
any
hide
himself
in
secret
places
that
I
shall
not
see
him?
saith
the
LORD.
Do
not
I
fill
heaven
and
earth?
saith
the
LORD.
023:025
I
have
heard
what
the
prophets
said,
that
prophesy
lies
in
my
name,
saying,
I
have
dreamed,
I
have
dreamed.
023:026
How
long
shall
this
be
in
the
heart
of
the
prophets
that
prophesy
lies?
yea,
they
are
prophets
of
the
deceit
of
their
own
heart;
023:027
Which
think
to
cause
my
people
to
forget
my
name
by
their
dreams
which
they
tell
every
man
to
his
neighbour,
as
their
fathers
have
forgotten
my
name
for
Baal.
023:028
The
prophet
that
hath
a
dream,
let
him
tell
a
dream;
and
he
that
hath
my
word,
let
him
speak
my
word
faithfully.
What
is
the
chaff
to
the
wheat?
saith
the
LORD.
023:029
Is
not
my
word
like
as
a
fire?
saith
the
LORD;
and
like
a
hammer
that
breaketh
the
rock
in
pieces?
023:030
Therefore,
behold,
I
am
against
the
prophets,
saith
the
LORD,
that
steal
my
words
every
one
from
his
neighbour.
023:031
Behold,
I
am
against
the
prophets,
saith
the
LORD,
that
use
their
tongues,
and
say,
He
saith.
023:032
Behold,
I
am
against
them
that
prophesy
false
dreams,
saith
the
LORD,
and
do
tell
them,
and
cause
my
people
to
err
by
their
lies,
and
by
their
lightness;
yet
I
sent
them
not,
nor
commanded
them:
therefore
they
shall
not
profit
this
people
at
all,
saith
the
LORD.
023:033
And
when
this
people,
or
the
prophet,
or
a
priest,
shall
ask
thee,
saying,
What
is
the
burden
of
the
LORD?
thou
shalt
then
say
unto
them,
What
burden?
I
will
even
forsake
you,
saith
the
LORD.
023:034
And
as
for
the
prophet,
and
the
priest,
and
the
people,
that
shall
say,
The
burden
of
the
LORD,
I
will
even
punish
that
man
and
his
house.
023:035
Thus
shall
ye
say
every
one
to
his
neighbour,
and
every
one
to
his
brother,
What
hath
the
LORD
answered?
and,
What
hath
the
LORD
spoken?
023:036
And
the
burden
of
the
LORD
shall
ye
mention
no
more:
for
every
man's
word
shall
be
his
burden;
for
ye
have
perverted
the
words
of
the
living
God,
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
our
God.
023:037
Thus
shalt
thou
say
to
the
prophet,
What
hath
the
LORD
answered
thee?
and,
What
hath
the
LORD
spoken?
023:038
But
since
ye
say,
The
burden
of
the
LORD;
therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Because
ye
say
this
word,
The
burden
of
the
LORD,
and
I
have
sent
unto
you,
saying,
Ye
shall
not
say,
The
burden
of
the
LORD;
023:039
Therefore,
behold,
I,
even
I,
will
utterly
forget
you,
and
I
will
forsake
you,
and
the
city
that
I
gave
you
and
your
fathers,
and
cast
you
out
of
my
presence:
023:040
And
I
will
bring
an
everlasting
reproach
upon
you,
and
a
perpetual
shame,
which
shall
not
be
forgotten.
024:001
The
LORD
shewed
me,
and,
behold,
two
baskets
of
figs
were
set
before
the
temple
of
the
LORD,
after
that
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
had
carried
away
captive
Jeconiah
the
son
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah,
and
the
princes
of
Judah,
with
the
carpenters
and
smiths,
from
Jerusalem,
and
had
brought
them
to
Babylon.
024:002
One
basket
had
very
good
figs,
even
like
the
figs
that
are
first
ripe:
and
the
other
basket
had
very
naughty
figs,
which
could
not
be
eaten,
they
were
so
bad.
024:003
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
me,
What
seest
thou,
Jeremiah?
And
I
said,
Figs;
the
good
figs,
very
good;
and
the
evil,
very
evil,
that
cannot
be
eaten,
they
are
so
evil.
024:004
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
024:005
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel;
Like
these
good
figs,
so
will
I
acknowledge
them
that
are
carried
away
captive
of
Judah,
whom
I
have
sent
out
of
this
place
into
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
for
their
good.
024:006
For
I
will
set
mine
eyes
upon
them
for
good,
and
I
will
bring
them
again
to
this
land:
and
I
will
build
them,
and
not
pull
them
down;
and
I
will
plant
them,
and
not
pluck
them
up.
024:007
And
I
will
give
them
an
heart
to
know
me,
that
I
am
the
LORD:
and
they
shall
be
my
people,
and
I
will
be
their
God:
for
they
shall
return
unto
me
with
their
whole
heart.
024:008
And
as
the
evil
figs,
which
cannot
be
eaten,
they
are
so
evil;
surely
thus
saith
the
LORD,
So
will
I
give
Zedekiah
the
king
of
Judah,
and
his
princes,
and
the
residue
of
Jerusalem,
that
remain
in
this
land,
and
them
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
Egypt:
024:009
And
I
will
deliver
them
to
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
for
their
hurt,
to
be
a
reproach
and
a
proverb,
a
taunt
and
a
curse,
in
all
places
whither
I
shall
drive
them.
024:010
And
I
will
send
the
sword,
the
famine,
and
the
pestilence,
among
them,
till
they
be
consumed
from
off
the
land
that
I
gave
unto
them
and
to
their
fathers.
025:001
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
concerning
all
the
people
of
Judah
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah,
that
was
the
first
year
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon;
025:002
The
which
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
unto
all
the
people
of
Judah,
and
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
saying,
025:003
From
the
thirteenth
year
of
Josiah
the
son
of
Amon
king
of
Judah,
even
unto
this
day,
that
is
the
three
and
twentieth
year,
the
word
of
the
LORD
hath
come
unto
me,
and
I
have
spoken
unto
you,
rising
early
and
speaking;
but
ye
have
not
hearkened.
025:004
And
the
LORD
hath
sent
unto
you
all
his
servants
the
prophets,
rising
early
and
sending
them;
but
ye
have
not
hearkened,
nor
inclined
your
ear
to
hear.
025:005
They
said,
Turn
ye
again
now
every
one
from
his
evil
way,
and
from
the
evil
of
your
doings,
and
dwell
in
the
land
that
the
LORD
hath
given
unto
you
and
to
your
fathers
for
ever
and
ever:
025:006
And
go
not
after
other
gods
to
serve
them,
and
to
worship
them,
and
provoke
me
not
to
anger
with
the
works
of
your
hands;
and
I
will
do
you
no
hurt.
025:007
Yet
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
me,
saith
the
LORD;
that
ye
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
the
works
of
your
hands
to
your
own
hurt.
025:008
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Because
ye
have
not
heard
my
words,
025:009
Behold,
I
will
send
and
take
all
the
families
of
the
north,
saith
the
LORD,
and
Nebuchadrezzar
the
king
of
Babylon,
my
servant,
and
will
bring
them
against
this
land,
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof,
and
against
all
these
nations
round
about,
and
will
utterly
destroy
them,
and
make
them
an
astonishment,
and
an
hissing,
and
perpetual
desolations.
025:010
Moreover
I
will
take
from
them
the
voice
of
mirth,
and
the
voice
of
gladness,
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom,
and
the
voice
of
the
bride,
the
sound
of
the
millstones,
and
the
light
of
the
candle.
025:011
And
this
whole
land
shall
be
a
desolation,
and
an
astonishment;
and
these
nations
shall
serve
the
king
of
Babylon
seventy
years.
025:012
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
seventy
years
are
accomplished,
that
I
will
punish
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
that
nation,
saith
the
LORD,
for
their
iniquity,
and
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
will
make
it
perpetual
desolations.
025:013
And
I
will
bring
upon
that
land
all
my
words
which
I
have
pronounced
against
it,
even
all
that
is
written
in
this
book,
which
Jeremiah
hath
prophesied
against
all
the
nations.
025:014
For
many
nations
and
great
kings
shall
serve
themselves
of
them
also:
and
I
will
recompense
them
according
to
their
deeds,
and
according
to
the
works
of
their
own
hands.
025:015
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
unto
me;
Take
the
wine
cup
of
this
fury
at
my
hand,
and
cause
all
the
nations,
to
whom
I
send
thee,
to
drink
it.
025:016
And
they
shall
drink,
and
be
moved,
and
be
mad,
because
of
the
sword
that
I
will
send
among
them.
025:017
Then
took
I
the
cup
at
the
LORD's
hand,
and
made
all
the
nations
to
drink,
unto
whom
the
LORD
had
sent
me:
025:018
To
wit,
Jerusalem,
and
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
the
kings
thereof,
and
the
princes
thereof,
to
make
them
a
desolation,
an
astonishment,
an
hissing,
and
a
curse;
as
it
is
this
day;
025:019
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
and
his
servants,
and
his
princes,
and
all
his
people;
025:020
And
all
the
mingled
people,
and
all
the
kings
of
the
land
of
Uz,
and
all
the
kings
of
the
land
of
the
Philistines,
and
Ashkelon,
and
Azzah,
and
Ekron,
and
the
remnant
of
Ashdod,
025:021
Edom,
and
Moab,
and
the
children
of
Ammon,
025:022
And
all
the
kings
of
Tyrus,
and
all
the
kings
of
Zidon,
and
the
kings
of
the
isles
which
are
beyond
the
sea,
025:023
Dedan,
and
Tema,
and
Buz,
and
all
that
are
in
the
utmost
corners,
025:024
And
all
the
kings
of
Arabia,
and
all
the
kings
of
the
mingled
people
that
dwell
in
the
desert,
025:025
And
all
the
kings
of
Zimri,
and
all
the
kings
of
Elam,
and
all
the
kings
of
the
Medes,
025:026
And
all
the
kings
of
the
north,
far
and
near,
one
with
another,
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world,
which
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth:
and
the
king
of
Sheshach
shall
drink
after
them.
025:027
Therefore
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Drink
ye,
and
be
drunken,
and
spue,
and
fall,
and
rise
no
more,
because
of
the
sword
which
I
will
send
among
you.
025:028
And
it
shall
be,
if
they
refuse
to
take
the
cup
at
thine
hand
to
drink,
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Ye
shall
certainly
drink.
025:029
For,
lo,
I
begin
to
bring
evil
on
the
city
which
is
called
by
my
name,
and
