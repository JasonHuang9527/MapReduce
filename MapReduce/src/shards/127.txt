should
ye
be
utterly
unpunished?
Ye
shall
not
be
unpunished:
for
I
will
call
for
a
sword
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
025:030
Therefore
prophesy
thou
against
them
all
these
words,
and
say
unto
them,
The
LORD
shall
roar
from
on
high,
and
utter
his
voice
from
his
holy
habitation;
he
shall
mightily
roar
upon
his
habitation;
he
shall
give
a
shout,
as
they
that
tread
the
grapes,
against
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth.
025:031
A
noise
shall
come
even
to
the
ends
of
the
earth;
for
the
LORD
hath
a
controversy
with
the
nations,
he
will
plead
with
all
flesh;
he
will
give
them
that
are
wicked
to
the
sword,
saith
the
LORD.
025:032
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
Behold,
evil
shall
go
forth
from
nation
to
nation,
and
a
great
whirlwind
shall
be
raised
up
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth.
025:033
And
the
slain
of
the
LORD
shall
be
at
that
day
from
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other
end
of
the
earth:
they
shall
not
be
lamented,
neither
gathered,
nor
buried;
they
shall
be
dung
upon
the
ground.
025:034
Howl,
ye
shepherds,
and
cry;
and
wallow
yourselves
in
the
ashes,
ye
principal
of
the
flock:
for
the
days
of
your
slaughter
and
of
your
dispersions
are
accomplished;
and
ye
shall
fall
like
a
pleasant
vessel.
025:035
And
the
shepherds
shall
have
no
way
to
flee,
nor
the
principal
of
the
flock
to
escape.
025:036
A
voice
of
the
cry
of
the
shepherds,
and
an
howling
of
the
principal
of
the
flock,
shall
be
heard:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoiled
their
pasture.
025:037
And
the
peaceable
habitations
are
cut
down
because
of
the
fierce
anger
of
the
LORD.
025:038
He
hath
forsaken
his
covert,
as
the
lion:
for
their
land
is
desolate
because
of
the
fierceness
of
the
oppressor,
and
because
of
his
fierce
anger.
026:001
In
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah
came
this
word
from
the
LORD,
saying,
026:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Stand
in
the
court
of
the
LORD's
house,
and
speak
unto
all
the
cities
of
Judah,
which
come
to
worship
in
the
LORD's
house,
all
the
words
that
I
command
thee
to
speak
unto
them;
diminish
not
a
word:
026:003
If
so
be
they
will
hearken,
and
turn
every
man
from
his
evil
way,
that
I
may
repent
me
of
the
evil,
which
I
purpose
to
do
unto
them
because
of
the
evil
of
their
doings.
026:004
And
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
If
ye
will
not
hearken
to
me,
to
walk
in
my
law,
which
I
have
set
before
you,
026:005
To
hearken
to
the
words
of
my
servants
the
prophets,
whom
I
sent
unto
you,
both
rising
up
early,
and
sending
them,
but
ye
have
not
hearkened;
026:006
Then
will
I
make
this
house
like
Shiloh,
and
will
make
this
city
a
curse
to
all
the
nations
of
the
earth.
026:007
So
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
heard
Jeremiah
speaking
these
words
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
026:008
Now
it
came
to
pass,
when
Jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
that
the
LORD
had
commanded
him
to
speak
unto
all
the
people,
that
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
took
him,
saying,
Thou
shalt
surely
die.
026:009
Why
hast
thou
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
LORD,
saying,
This
house
shall
be
like
Shiloh,
and
this
city
shall
be
desolate
without
an
inhabitant?
And
all
the
people
were
gathered
against
Jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
026:010
When
the
princes
of
Judah
heard
these
things,
then
they
came
up
from
the
king's
house
unto
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
sat
down
in
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
LORD's
house.
026:011
Then
spake
the
priests
and
the
prophets
unto
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people,
saying,
This
man
is
worthy
to
die;
for
he
hath
prophesied
against
this
city,
as
ye
have
heard
with
your
ears.
026:012
Then
spake
Jeremiah
unto
all
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people,
saying,
The
LORD
sent
me
to
prophesy
against
this
house
and
against
this
city
all
the
words
that
ye
have
heard.
026:013
Therefore
now
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings,
and
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD
your
God;
and
the
LORD
will
repent
him
of
the
evil
that
he
hath
pronounced
against
you.
026:014
As
for
me,
behold,
I
am
in
your
hand:
do
with
me
as
seemeth
good
and
meet
unto
you.
026:015
But
know
ye
for
certain,
that
if
ye
put
me
to
death,
ye
shall
surely
bring
innocent
blood
upon
yourselves,
and
upon
this
city,
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof:
for
of
a
truth
the
LORD
hath
sent
me
unto
you
to
speak
all
these
words
in
your
ears.
026:016
Then
said
the
princes
and
all
the
people
unto
the
priests
and
to
the
prophets;
This
man
is
not
worthy
to
die:
for
he
hath
spoken
to
us
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
our
God.
026:017
Then
rose
up
certain
of
the
elders
of
the
land,
and
spake
to
all
the
assembly
of
the
people,
saying,
026:018
Micah
the
Morasthite
prophesied
in
the
days
of
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah,
and
spake
to
all
the
people
of
Judah,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Zion
shall
be
plowed
like
a
field,
and
Jerusalem
shall
become
heaps,
and
the
mountain
of
the
house
as
the
high
places
of
a
forest.
026:019
Did
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah
and
all
Judah
put
him
at
all
to
death?
did
he
not
fear
the
LORD,
and
besought
the
LORD,
and
the
LORD
repented
him
of
the
evil
which
he
had
pronounced
against
them?
Thus
might
we
procure
great
evil
against
our
souls.
026:020
And
there
was
also
a
man
that
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
LORD,
Urijah
the
son
of
Shemaiah
of
Kirjathjearim,
who
prophesied
against
this
city
and
against
this
land
according
to
all
the
words
of
Jeremiah.
026:021
And
when
Jehoiakim
the
king,
with
all
his
mighty
men,
and
all
the
princes,
heard
his
words,
the
king
sought
to
put
him
to
death:
but
when
Urijah
heard
it,
he
was
afraid,
and
fled,
and
went
into
Egypt;
026:022
And
Jehoiakim
the
king
sent
men
into
Egypt,
namely,
Elnathan
the
son
of
Achbor,
and
certain
men
with
him
into
Egypt.
026:023
And
they
fetched
forth
Urijah
out
of
Egypt,
and
brought
him
unto
Jehoiakim
the
king;
who
slew
him
with
the
sword,
and
cast
his
dead
body
into
the
graves
of
the
common
people.
026:024
Nevertheless
the
hand
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
was
with
Jeremiah,
that
they
should
not
give
him
into
the
hand
of
the
people
to
put
him
to
death.
027:001
In
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah
came
this
word
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
saying,
027:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD
to
me;
Make
thee
bonds
and
yokes,
and
put
them
upon
thy
neck,
027:003
And
send
them
to
the
king
of
Edom,
and
to
the
king
of
Moab,
and
to
the
king
of
the
Ammonites,
and
to
the
king
of
Tyrus,
and
to
the
king
of
Zidon,
by
the
hand
of
the
messengers
which
come
to
Jerusalem
unto
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah;
027:004
And
command
them
to
say
unto
their
masters,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Thus
shall
ye
say
unto
your
masters;
027:005
I
have
made
the
earth,
the
man
and
the
beast
that
are
upon
the
ground,
by
my
great
power
and
by
my
outstretched
arm,
and
have
given
it
unto
whom
it
seemed
meet
unto
me.
027:006
And
now
have
I
given
all
these
lands
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
Babylon,
my
servant;
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
have
I
given
him
also
to
serve
him.
027:007
And
all
nations
shall
serve
him,
and
his
son,
and
his
son's
son,
until
the
very
time
of
his
land
come:
and
then
many
nations
and
great
kings
shall
serve
themselves
of
him.
027:008
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
the
nation
and
kingdom
which
will
not
serve
the
same
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
that
will
not
put
their
neck
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
that
nation
will
I
punish,
saith
the
LORD,
with
the
sword,
and
with
the
famine,
and
with
the
pestilence,
until
I
have
consumed
them
by
his
hand.
027:009
Therefore
hearken
not
ye
to
your
prophets,
nor
to
your
diviners,
nor
to
your
dreamers,
nor
to
your
enchanters,
nor
to
your
sorcerers,
which
speak
unto
you,
saying,
Ye
shall
not
serve
the
king
of
Babylon:
027:010
For
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you,
to
remove
you
far
from
your
land;
and
that
I
should
drive
you
out,
and
ye
should
perish.
027:011
But
the
nations
that
bring
their
neck
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
serve
him,
those
will
I
let
remain
still
in
their
own
land,
saith
the
LORD;
and
they
shall
till
it,
and
dwell
therein.
027:012
I
spake
also
to
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
according
to
all
these
words,
saying,
Bring
your
necks
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
serve
him
and
his
people,
and
live.
027:013
Why
will
ye
die,
thou
and
thy
people,
by
the
sword,
by
the
famine,
and
by
the
pestilence,
as
the
LORD
hath
spoken
against
the
nation
that
will
not
serve
the
king
of
Babylon?
027:014
Therefore
hearken
not
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
that
speak
unto
you,
saying,
Ye
shall
not
serve
the
king
of
Babylon:
for
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you.
027:015
For
I
have
not
sent
them,
saith
the
LORD,
yet
they
prophesy
a
lie
in
my
name;
that
I
might
drive
you
out,
and
that
ye
might
perish,
ye,
and
the
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you.
027:016
Also
I
spake
to
the
priests
and
to
all
this
people,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Hearken
not
to
the
words
of
your
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you,
saying,
Behold,
the
vessels
of
the
LORD's
house
shall
now
shortly
be
brought
again
from
Babylon:
for
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you.
027:017
Hearken
not
unto
them;
serve
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
live:
wherefore
should
this
city
be
laid
waste?
027:018
But
if
they
be
prophets,
and
if
the
word
of
the
LORD
be
with
them,
let
them
now
make
intercession
to
the
LORD
of
hosts,
that
the
vessels
which
are
left
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah,
and
at
Jerusalem,
go
not
to
Babylon.
027:019
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts
concerning
the
pillars,
and
concerning
the
sea,
and
concerning
the
bases,
and
concerning
the
residue
of
the
vessels
that
remain
in
this
city.
027:020
Which
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
took
not,
when
he
carried
away
captive
Jeconiah
the
son
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon,
and
all
the
nobles
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem;
027:021
Yea,
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
concerning
the
vessels
that
remain
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah
and
of
Jerusalem;
027:022
They
shall
be
carried
to
Babylon,
and
there
shall
they
be
until
the
day
that
I
visit
them,
saith
the
LORD;
then
will
I
bring
them
up,
and
restore
them
to
this
place.
028:001
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
year,
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah,
in
the
fourth
year,
and
in
the
fifth
month,
that
Hananiah
the
son
of
Azur
the
prophet,
which
was
of
Gibeon,
spake
unto
me
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
and
of
all
the
people,
saying,
028:002
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
saying,
I
have
broken
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon.
028:003
Within
two
full
years
will
I
bring
again
into
this
place
all
the
vessels
of
the
LORD's
house,
that
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
took
away
from
this
place,
and
carried
them
to
Babylon:
028:004
And
I
will
bring
again
to
this
place
Jeconiah
the
son
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah,
with
all
the
captives
of
Judah,
that
went
into
Babylon,
saith
the
LORD:
for
I
will
break
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon.
028:005
Then
the
prophet
Jeremiah
said
unto
the
prophet
Hananiah
in
the
presence
of
the
priests,
and
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people
that
stood
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
028:006
Even
the
prophet
Jeremiah
said,
Amen:
the
LORD
do
so:
the
LORD
perform
thy
words
which
thou
hast
prophesied,
to
bring
again
the
vessels
of
the
LORD's
house,
and
all
that
is
carried
away
captive,
from
Babylon
into
this
place.
028:007
Nevertheless
hear
thou
now
this
word
that
I
speak
in
thine
ears,
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
people;
028:008
The
prophets
that
have
been
before
me
and
before
thee
of
old
prophesied
both
against
many
countries,
and
against
great
kingdoms,
of
war,
and
of
evil,
and
of
pestilence.
028:009
The
prophet
which
prophesieth
of
peace,
when
the
word
of
the
prophet
shall
come
to
pass,
then
shall
the
prophet
be
known,
that
the
LORD
hath
truly
sent
him.
028:010
Then
Hananiah
the
prophet
took
the
yoke
from
off
the
prophet
Jeremiah's
neck,
and
brake
it.
028:011
And
Hananiah
spake
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Even
so
will
I
break
the
yoke
of
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
from
the
neck
of
all
nations
within
the
space
of
two
full
years.
And
the
prophet
Jeremiah
went
his
way.
028:012
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Jeremiah
the
prophet,
after
that
Hananiah
the
prophet
had
broken
the
yoke
from
off
the
neck
of
the
prophet
Jeremiah,
saying,
028:013
Go
and
tell
Hananiah,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Thou
hast
broken
the
yokes
of
wood;
but
thou
shalt
make
for
them
yokes
of
iron.
028:014
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
I
have
put
a
yoke
of
iron
upon
the
neck
of
all
these
nations,
that
they
may
serve
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon;
and
they
shall
serve
him:
and
I
have
given
him
the
beasts
of
the
field
also.
028:015
Then
said
the
prophet
Jeremiah
unto
Hananiah
the
prophet,
Hear
now,
Hananiah;
The
LORD
hath
not
sent
thee;
but
thou
makest
this
people
to
trust
in
a
lie.
028:016
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
will
cast
thee
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth:
this
year
thou
shalt
die,
because
thou
hast
taught
rebellion
against
the
LORD.
028:017
So
Hananiah
the
prophet
died
the
same
year
in
the
seventh
month.
029:001
Now
these
are
the
words
of
the
letter
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
sent
from
Jerusalem
unto
the
residue
of
the
elders
which
were
carried
away
captives,
and
to
the
priests,
and
to
the
prophets,
and
to
all
the
people
whom
Nebuchadnezzar
had
carried
away
captive
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon;
029:002
(After
that
Jeconiah
the
king,
and
the
queen,
and
the
eunuchs,
the
princes
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
and
the
carpenters,
and
the
smiths,
were
departed
from
Jerusalem;)
029:003
By
the
hand
of
Elasah
the
son
of
Shaphan,
and
Gemariah
the
son
of
Hilkiah,
(whom
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
sent
unto
Babylon
to
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon)
saying,
029:004
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
unto
all
that
are
carried
away
captives,
whom
I
have
caused
to
be
carried
away
from
Jerusalem
unto
Babylon;
029:005
Build
ye
houses,
and
dwell
in
them;
and
plant
gardens,
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them;
029:006
Take
ye
wives,
and
beget
sons
and
daughters;
and
take
wives
for
your
sons,
and
give
your
daughters
to
husbands,
that
they
may
bear
sons
and
daughters;
that
ye
may
be
increased
there,
and
not
diminished.
029:007
And
seek
the
peace
of
the
city
whither
I
have
caused
you
to
be
carried
away
captives,
and
pray
unto
the
LORD
for
it:
for
in
the
peace
thereof
shall
ye
have
peace.
029:008
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Let
not
your
prophets
and
your
diviners,
that
be
in
the
midst
of
you,
deceive
you,
neither
hearken
to
your
dreams
which
ye
cause
to
be
dreamed.
029:009
For
they
prophesy
falsely
unto
you
in
my
name:
I
have
not
sent
them,
saith
the
LORD.
029:010
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
That
after
seventy
years
be
accomplished
at
Babylon
I
will
visit
you,
and
perform
my
good
word
toward
you,
in
causing
you
to
return
to
this
place.
029:011
For
I
know
the
thoughts
that
I
think
toward
you,
saith
the
LORD,
thoughts
of
peace,
and
not
of
evil,
to
give
you
an
expected
end.
029:012
Then
shall
ye
call
upon
me,
and
ye
shall
go
and
pray
unto
me,
and
I
will
hearken
unto
you.
029:013
And
ye
shall
seek
me,
and
find
me,
when
ye
shall
search
for
me
with
all
your
heart.
029:014
And
I
will
be
found
of
you,
saith
the
LORD:
and
I
will
turn
away
your
captivity,
and
I
will
gather
you
from
all
the
nations,
and
from
all
the
places
whither
I
have
driven
you,
saith
the
LORD;
and
I
will
bring
you
again
into
the
place
whence
I
caused
you
to
be
carried
away
captive.
029:015
Because
ye
have
said,
The
LORD
hath
raised
us
up
prophets
in
Babylon;
029:016
Know
that
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
king
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
of
David,
and
of
all
the
people
that
dwelleth
in
this
city,
and
of
your
brethren
that
are
not
gone
forth
with
you
into
captivity;
029:017
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Behold,
I
will
send
upon
them
the
sword,
the
famine,
and
the
pestilence,
and
will
make
them
like
vile
figs,
that
cannot
be
eaten,
they
are
so
evil.
029:018
And
I
will
persecute
them
with
the
sword,
with
the
famine,
and
with
the
pestilence,
and
will
deliver
them
to
be
removed
to
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth,
to
be
a
curse,
and
an
astonishment,
and
an
hissing,
and
a
reproach,
among
all
the
nations
whither
I
have
driven
them:
029:019
Because
they
have
not
hearkened
to
my
words,
saith
the
LORD,
which
I
sent
unto
them
by
my
servants
the
prophets,
rising
up
early
and
sending
them;
but
ye
would
not
hear,
saith
the
LORD.
029:020
Hear
ye
therefore
the
word
of
the
LORD,
all
ye
of
the
captivity,
whom
I
have
sent
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon:
029:021
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
of
Ahab
the
son
of
Kolaiah,
and
of
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Maaseiah,
which
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
in
my
name;
Behold,
I
will
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon;
and
he
shall
slay
them
before
your
eyes;
029:022
And
of
them
shall
be
taken
up
a
curse
by
all
the
captivity
of
Judah
which
are
in
Babylon,
saying,
The
LORD
make
thee
like
Zedekiah
and
like
Ahab,
whom
the
king
of
Babylon
roasted
in
the
fire;
029:023
Because
they
have
committed
villany
in
Israel,
and
have
committed
adultery
with
their
neighbours'
wives,
and
have
spoken
lying
words
in
my
name,
which
I
have
not
commanded
them;
even
I
know,
and
am
a
witness,
saith
the
LORD.
029:024
Thus
shalt
thou
also
speak
to
Shemaiah
the
Nehelamite,
saying,
029:025
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
saying,
Because
thou
hast
sent
letters
in
thy
name
unto
all
the
people
that
are
at
Jerusalem,
and
to
Zephaniah
the
son
of
Maaseiah
the
priest,
and
to
all
the
priests,
saying,
029:026
The
LORD
hath
made
thee
priest
in
the
stead
of
Jehoiada
the
priest,
that
ye
should
be
officers
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
for
every
man
that
is
mad,
and
maketh
himself
a
prophet,
that
thou
shouldest
put
him
in
prison,
and
in
the
stocks.
029:027
Now
therefore
why
hast
thou
not
reproved
Jeremiah
of
Anathoth,
which
maketh
himself
a
prophet
to
you?
029:028
For
therefore
he
sent
unto
us
in
Babylon,
saying,
This
captivity
is
long:
build
ye
houses,
and
dwell
in
them;
and
plant
gardens,
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them.
029:029
And
Zephaniah
the
priest
read
this
letter
in
the
ears
of
Jeremiah
the
prophet.
029:030
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Jeremiah,
saying,
029:031
Send
to
all
them
of
the
captivity,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
concerning
Shemaiah
the
Nehelamite;
Because
that
Shemaiah
hath
prophesied
unto
you,
and
I
sent
him
not,
and
he
caused
you
to
trust
in
a
lie:
029:032
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
will
punish
Shemaiah
the
Nehelamite,
and
his
seed:
he
shall
not
have
a
man
to
dwell
among
this
people;
neither
shall
he
behold
the
good
that
I
will
do
for
my
people,
saith
the
LORD;
because
he
hath
taught
rebellion
against
the
LORD.
030:001
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
saying,
030:002
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
saying,
Write
thee
all
the
words
that
I
have
spoken
unto
thee
in
a
book.
030:003
For,
lo,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
my
people
Israel
and
Judah,
saith
the
LORD:
and
I
will
cause
them
to
return
to
the
land
that
I
gave
to
their
fathers,
and
they
shall
possess
it.
030:004
And
these
are
the
words
that
the
LORD
spake
concerning
Israel
and
concerning
Judah.
030:005
For
thus
saith
the
LORD;
We
have
heard
a
voice
of
trembling,
of
fear,
and
not
of
peace.
030:006
Ask
ye
now,
and
see
whether
a
man
doth
travail
with
child?
wherefore
do
I
see
every
man
with
his
hands
on
his
loins,
as
a
woman
in
travail,
and
all
faces
are
turned
into
paleness?
030:007
Alas!
for
that
day
is
great,
so
that
none
is
like
it:
it
is
even
the
time
of
Jacob's
trouble,
but
he
shall
be
saved
out
of
it.
030:008
For
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
that
I
will
break
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck,
and
will
burst
thy
bonds,
and
strangers
shall
no
more
serve
themselves
of
him:
030:009
But
they
shall
serve
the
LORD
their
God,
and
David
their
king,
whom
I
will
raise
up
unto
them.
030:010
Therefore
fear
thou
not,
O
my
servant
Jacob,
saith
the
LORD;
neither
be
dismayed,
O
Israel:
for,
lo,
I
will
save
thee
from
afar,
and
thy
seed
from
the
land
of
their
captivity;
and
Jacob
shall
return,
and
shall
be
in
rest,
and
be
quiet,
and
none
shall
make
him
afraid.
030:011
For
I
am
with
thee,
saith
the
LORD,
to
save
thee:
though
I
make
a
full
end
of
all
nations
whither
I
have
scattered
thee,
yet
I
will
not
make
a
full
end
of
thee:
but
I
will
correct
thee
in
measure,
and
will
not
leave
thee
altogether
unpunished.
030:012
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Thy
bruise
is
incurable,
and
thy
wound
is
grievous.
030:013
There
is
none
to
plead
thy
cause,
that
thou
mayest
be
bound
up:
thou
hast
no
healing
medicines.
030:014
All
thy
lovers
have
forgotten
thee;
they
seek
thee
not;
for
I
have
wounded
thee
with
the
wound
of
an
enemy,
with
the
chastisement
of
a
cruel
one,
for
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquity;
because
thy
sins
were
increased.
030:015
Why
criest
thou
for
thine
affliction?
thy
sorrow
is
incurable
for
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquity:
because
thy
sins
were
increased,
I
have
done
these
things
unto
thee.
030:016
Therefore
all
they
that
devour
thee
shall
be
devoured;
and
all
thine
adversaries,
every
one
of
them,
shall
go
into
captivity;
and
they
that
spoil
thee
shall
be
a
spoil,
and
all
that
prey
upon
thee
will
I
give
for
a
prey.
030:017
For
I
will
restore
health
unto
thee,
and
I
will
heal
thee
of
thy
wounds,
saith
the
LORD;
because
they
called
thee
an
Outcast,
saying,
This
is
Zion,
whom
no
man
seeketh
after.
030:018
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
Jacob's
tents,
and
have
mercy
on
his
dwellingplaces;
and
the
city
shall
be
builded
upon
her
own
heap,
and
the
palace
shall
remain
after
the
manner
thereof.
030:019
And
out
of
them
shall
proceed
thanksgiving
and
the
voice
of
them
