that
make
merry:
and
I
will
multiply
them,
and
they
shall
not
be
few;
I
will
also
glorify
them,
and
they
shall
not
be
small.
030:020
Their
children
also
shall
be
as
aforetime,
and
their
congregation
shall
be
established
before
me,
and
I
will
punish
all
that
oppress
them.
030:021
And
their
nobles
shall
be
of
themselves,
and
their
governor
shall
proceed
from
the
midst
of
them;
and
I
will
cause
him
to
draw
near,
and
he
shall
approach
unto
me:
for
who
is
this
that
engaged
his
heart
to
approach
unto
me?
saith
the
LORD.
030:022
And
ye
shall
be
my
people,
and
I
will
be
your
God.
030:023
Behold,
the
whirlwind
of
the
LORD
goeth
forth
with
fury,
a
continuing
whirlwind:
it
shall
fall
with
pain
upon
the
head
of
the
wicked.
030:024
The
fierce
anger
of
the
LORD
shall
not
return,
until
he
hath
done
it,
and
until
he
have
performed
the
intents
of
his
heart:
in
the
latter
days
ye
shall
consider
it.
031:001
At
the
same
time,
saith
the
LORD,
will
I
be
the
God
of
all
the
families
of
Israel,
and
they
shall
be
my
people.
031:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
The
people
which
were
left
of
the
sword
found
grace
in
the
wilderness;
even
Israel,
when
I
went
to
cause
him
to
rest.
031:003
The
LORD
hath
appeared
of
old
unto
me,
saying,
Yea,
I
have
loved
thee
with
an
everlasting
love:
therefore
with
lovingkindness
have
I
drawn
thee.
031:004
Again
I
will
build
thee,
and
thou
shalt
be
built,
O
virgin
of
Israel:
thou
shalt
again
be
adorned
with
thy
tabrets,
and
shalt
go
forth
in
the
dances
of
them
that
make
merry.
031:005
Thou
shalt
yet
plant
vines
upon
the
mountains
of
Samaria:
the
planters
shall
plant,
and
shall
eat
them
as
common
things.
031:006
For
there
shall
be
a
day,
that
the
watchmen
upon
the
mount
Ephraim
shall
cry,
Arise
ye,
and
let
us
go
up
to
Zion
unto
the
LORD
our
God.
031:007
For
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Sing
with
gladness
for
Jacob,
and
shout
among
the
chief
of
the
nations:
publish
ye,
praise
ye,
and
say,
O
LORD,
save
thy
people,
the
remnant
of
Israel.
031:008
Behold,
I
will
bring
them
from
the
north
country,
and
gather
them
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth,
and
with
them
the
blind
and
the
lame,
the
woman
with
child
and
her
that
travaileth
with
child
together:
a
great
company
shall
return
thither.
031:009
They
shall
come
with
weeping,
and
with
supplications
will
I
lead
them:
I
will
cause
them
to
walk
by
the
rivers
of
waters
in
a
straight
way,
wherein
they
shall
not
stumble:
for
I
am
a
father
to
Israel,
and
Ephraim
is
my
firstborn.
031:010
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
O
ye
nations,
and
declare
it
in
the
isles
afar
off,
and
say,
He
that
scattered
Israel
will
gather
him,
and
keep
him,
as
a
shepherd
doth
his
flock.
031:011
For
the
LORD
hath
redeemed
Jacob,
and
ransomed
him
from
the
hand
of
him
that
was
stronger
than
he.
031:012
Therefore
they
shall
come
and
sing
in
the
height
of
Zion,
and
shall
flow
together
to
the
goodness
of
the
LORD,
for
wheat,
and
for
wine,
and
for
oil,
and
for
the
young
of
the
flock
and
of
the
herd:
and
their
soul
shall
be
as
a
watered
garden;
and
they
shall
not
sorrow
any
more
at
all.
031:013
Then
shall
the
virgin
rejoice
in
the
dance,
both
young
men
and
old
together:
for
I
will
turn
their
mourning
into
joy,
and
will
comfort
them,
and
make
them
rejoice
from
their
sorrow.
031:014
And
I
will
satiate
the
soul
of
the
priests
with
fatness,
and
my
people
shall
be
satisfied
with
my
goodness,
saith
the
LORD.
031:015
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
A
voice
was
heard
in
Ramah,
lamentation,
and
bitter
weeping;
Rahel
weeping
for
her
children
refused
to
be
comforted
for
her
children,
because
they
were
not.
031:016
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Refrain
thy
voice
from
weeping,
and
thine
eyes
from
tears:
for
thy
work
shall
be
rewarded,
saith
the
LORD;
and
they
shall
come
again
from
the
land
of
the
enemy.
031:017
And
there
is
hope
in
thine
end,
saith
the
LORD,
that
thy
children
shall
come
again
to
their
own
border.
031:018
I
have
surely
heard
Ephraim
bemoaning
himself
thus;
Thou
hast
chastised
me,
and
I
was
chastised,
as
a
bullock
unaccustomed
to
the
yoke:
turn
thou
me,
and
I
shall
be
turned;
for
thou
art
the
LORD
my
God.
031:019
Surely
after
that
I
was
turned,
I
repented;
and
after
that
I
was
instructed,
I
smote
upon
my
thigh:
I
was
ashamed,
yea,
even
confounded,
because
I
did
bear
the
reproach
of
my
youth.
031:020
Is
Ephraim
my
dear
son?
is
he
a
pleasant
child?
for
since
I
spake
against
him,
I
do
earnestly
remember
him
still:
therefore
my
bowels
are
troubled
for
him;
I
will
surely
have
mercy
upon
him,
saith
the
LORD.
031:021
Set
thee
up
waymarks,
make
thee
high
heaps:
set
thine
heart
toward
the
highway,
even
the
way
which
thou
wentest:
turn
again,
O
virgin
of
Israel,
turn
again
to
these
thy
cities.
031:022
How
long
wilt
thou
go
about,
O
thou
backsliding
daughter?
for
the
LORD
hath
created
a
new
thing
in
the
earth,
A
woman
shall
compass
a
man.
031:023
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
As
yet
they
shall
use
this
speech
in
the
land
of
Judah
and
in
the
cities
thereof,
when
I
shall
bring
again
their
captivity;
The
LORD
bless
thee,
O
habitation
of
justice,
and
mountain
of
holiness.
031:024
And
there
shall
dwell
in
Judah
itself,
and
in
all
the
cities
thereof
together,
husbandmen,
and
they
that
go
forth
with
flocks.
031:025
For
I
have
satiated
the
weary
soul,
and
I
have
replenished
every
sorrowful
soul.
031:026
Upon
this
I
awaked,
and
beheld;
and
my
sleep
was
sweet
unto
me.
031:027
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
sow
the
house
of
Israel
and
the
house
of
Judah
with
the
seed
of
man,
and
with
the
seed
of
beast.
031:028
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
like
as
I
have
watched
over
them,
to
pluck
up,
and
to
break
down,
and
to
throw
down,
and
to
destroy,
and
to
afflict;
so
will
I
watch
over
them,
to
build,
and
to
plant,
saith
the
LORD.
031:029
In
those
days
they
shall
say
no
more,
The
fathers
have
eaten
a
sour
grape,
and
the
children's
teeth
are
set
on
edge.
031:030
But
every
one
shall
die
for
his
own
iniquity:
every
man
that
eateth
the
sour
grape,
his
teeth
shall
be
set
on
edge.
031:031
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
Israel,
and
with
the
house
of
Judah:
031:032
Not
according
to
the
covenant
that
I
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
that
I
took
them
by
the
hand
to
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt;
which
my
covenant
they
brake,
although
I
was
an
husband
unto
them,
saith
the
LORD:
031:033
But
this
shall
be
the
covenant
that
I
will
make
with
the
house
of
Israel;
After
those
days,
saith
the
LORD,
I
will
put
my
law
in
their
inward
parts,
and
write
it
in
their
hearts;
and
will
be
their
God,
and
they
shall
be
my
people.
031:034
And
they
shall
teach
no
more
every
man
his
neighbour,
and
every
man
his
brother,
saying,
Know
the
LORD:
for
they
shall
all
know
me,
from
the
least
of
them
unto
the
greatest
of
them,
saith
the
LORD:
for
I
will
forgive
their
iniquity,
and
I
will
remember
their
sin
no
more.
031:035
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
which
giveth
the
sun
for
a
light
by
day,
and
the
ordinances
of
the
moon
and
of
the
stars
for
a
light
by
night,
which
divideth
the
sea
when
the
waves
thereof
roar;
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
his
name:
031:036
If
those
ordinances
depart
from
before
me,
saith
the
LORD,
then
the
seed
of
Israel
also
shall
cease
from
being
a
nation
before
me
for
ever.
031:037
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
If
heaven
above
can
be
measured,
and
the
foundations
of
the
earth
searched
out
beneath,
I
will
also
cast
off
all
the
seed
of
Israel
for
all
that
they
have
done,
saith
the
LORD.
031:038
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
the
city
shall
be
built
to
the
LORD
from
the
tower
of
Hananeel
unto
the
gate
of
the
corner.
031:039
And
the
measuring
line
shall
yet
go
forth
over
against
it
upon
the
hill
Gareb,
and
shall
compass
about
to
Goath.
031:040
And
the
whole
valley
of
the
dead
bodies,
and
of
the
ashes,
and
all
the
fields
unto
the
brook
of
Kidron,
unto
the
corner
of
the
horse
gate
toward
the
east,
shall
be
holy
unto
the
LORD;
it
shall
not
be
plucked
up,
nor
thrown
down
any
more
for
ever.
032:001
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD
in
the
tenth
year
of
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah,
which
was
the
eighteenth
year
of
Nebuchadrezzar.
032:002
For
then
the
king
of
Babylon's
army
besieged
Jerusalem:
and
Jeremiah
the
prophet
was
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
prison,
which
was
in
the
king
of
Judah's
house.
032:003
For
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
had
shut
him
up,
saying,
Wherefore
dost
thou
prophesy,
and
say,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
he
shall
take
it;
032:004
And
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
shall
not
escape
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans,
but
shall
surely
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
shall
speak
with
him
mouth
to
mouth,
and
his
eyes
shall
behold
his
eyes;
032:005
And
he
shall
lead
Zedekiah
to
Babylon,
and
there
shall
he
be
until
I
visit
him,
saith
the
LORD:
though
ye
fight
with
the
Chaldeans,
ye
shall
not
prosper.
032:006
And
Jeremiah
said,
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
032:007
Behold,
Hanameel
the
son
of
Shallum
thine
uncle
shall
come
unto
thee
saying,
Buy
thee
my
field
that
is
in
Anathoth:
for
the
right
of
redemption
is
thine
to
buy
it.
032:008
So
Hanameel
mine
uncle's
son
came
to
me
in
the
court
of
the
prison
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
and
said
unto
me,
Buy
my
field,
I
pray
thee,
that
is
in
Anathoth,
which
is
in
the
country
of
Benjamin:
for
the
right
of
inheritance
is
thine,
and
the
redemption
is
thine;
buy
it
for
thyself.
Then
I
knew
that
this
was
the
word
of
the
LORD.
032:009
And
I
bought
the
field
of
Hanameel
my
uncle's
son,
that
was
in
Anathoth,
and
weighed
him
the
money,
even
seventeen
shekels
of
silver.
032:010
And
I
subscribed
the
evidence,
and
sealed
it,
and
took
witnesses,
and
weighed
him
the
money
in
the
balances.
032:011
So
I
took
the
evidence
of
the
purchase,
both
that
which
was
sealed
according
to
the
law
and
custom,
and
that
which
was
open:
032:012
And
I
gave
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
unto
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah,
the
son
of
Maaseiah,
in
the
sight
of
Hanameel
mine
uncle's
son,
and
in
the
presence
of
the
witnesses
that
subscribed
the
book
of
the
purchase,
before
all
the
Jews
that
sat
in
the
court
of
the
prison.
032:013
And
I
charged
Baruch
before
them,
saying,
032:014
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Take
these
evidences,
this
evidence
of
the
purchase,
both
which
is
sealed,
and
this
evidence
which
is
open;
and
put
them
in
an
earthen
vessel,
that
they
may
continue
many
days.
032:015
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Houses
and
fields
and
vineyards
shall
be
possessed
again
in
this
land.
032:016
Now
when
I
had
delivered
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
unto
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah,
I
prayed
unto
the
LORD,
saying,
032:017
Ah
Lord
GOD!
behold,
thou
hast
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
by
thy
great
power
and
stretched
out
arm,
and
there
is
nothing
too
hard
for
thee:
032:018
Thou
shewest
lovingkindness
unto
thousands,
and
recompensest
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
into
the
bosom
of
their
children
after
them:
the
Great,
the
Mighty
God,
the
LORD
of
hosts,
is
his
name,
032:019
Great
in
counsel,
and
mighty
in
work:
for
thine
eyes
are
open
upon
all
the
ways
of
the
sons
of
men:
to
give
every
one
according
to
his
ways,
and
according
to
the
fruit
of
his
doings:
032:020
Which
hast
set
signs
and
wonders
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
even
unto
this
day,
and
in
Israel,
and
among
other
men;
and
hast
made
thee
a
name,
as
at
this
day;
032:021
And
hast
brought
forth
thy
people
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
signs,
and
with
wonders,
and
with
a
strong
hand,
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm,
and
with
great
terror;
032:022
And
hast
given
them
this
land,
which
thou
didst
swear
to
their
fathers
to
give
them,
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey;
032:023
And
they
came
in,
and
possessed
it;
but
they
obeyed
not
thy
voice,
neither
walked
in
thy
law;
they
have
done
nothing
of
all
that
thou
commandedst
them
to
do:
therefore
thou
hast
caused
all
this
evil
to
come
upon
them:
032:024
Behold
the
mounts,
they
are
come
unto
the
city
to
take
it;
and
the
city
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans,
that
fight
against
it,
because
of
the
sword,
and
of
the
famine,
and
of
the
pestilence:
and
what
thou
hast
spoken
is
come
to
pass;
and,
behold,
thou
seest
it.
032:025
And
thou
hast
said
unto
me,
O
Lord
GOD,
Buy
thee
the
field
for
money,
and
take
witnesses;
for
the
city
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans.
032:026
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Jeremiah,
saying,
032:027
Behold,
I
am
the
LORD,
the
God
of
all
flesh:
is
there
any
thing
too
hard
for
me?
032:028
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon,
and
he
shall
take
it:
032:029
And
the
Chaldeans,
that
fight
against
this
city,
shall
come
and
set
fire
on
this
city,
and
burn
it
with
the
houses,
upon
whose
roofs
they
have
offered
incense
unto
Baal,
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods,
to
provoke
me
to
anger.
032:030
For
the
children
of
Israel
and
the
children
of
Judah
have
only
done
evil
before
me
from
their
youth:
for
the
children
of
Israel
have
only
provoked
me
to
anger
with
the
work
of
their
hands,
saith
the
LORD.
032:031
For
this
city
hath
been
to
me
as
a
provocation
of
mine
anger
and
of
my
fury
from
the
day
that
they
built
it
even
unto
this
day;
that
I
should
remove
it
from
before
my
face,
032:032
Because
of
all
the
evil
of
the
children
of
Israel
and
of
the
children
of
Judah,
which
they
have
done
to
provoke
me
to
anger,
they,
their
kings,
their
princes,
their
priests,
and
their
prophets,
and
the
men
of
Judah,
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem.
032:033
And
they
have
turned
unto
me
the
back,
and
not
the
face:
though
I
taught
them,
rising
up
early
and
teaching
them,
yet
they
have
not
hearkened
to
receive
instruction.
032:034
But
they
set
their
abominations
in
the
house,
which
is
called
by
my
name,
to
defile
it.
032:035
And
they
built
the
high
places
of
Baal,
which
are
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
to
cause
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
pass
through
the
fire
unto
Molech;
which
I
commanded
them
not,
neither
came
it
into
my
mind,
that
they
should
do
this
abomination,
to
cause
Judah
to
sin.
032:036
And
now
therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel,
concerning
this
city,
whereof
ye
say,
It
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
by
the
sword,
and
by
the
famine,
and
by
the
pestilence;
032:037
Behold,
I
will
gather
them
out
of
all
countries,
whither
I
have
driven
them
in
mine
anger,
and
in
my
fury,
and
in
great
wrath;
and
I
will
bring
them
again
unto
this
place,
and
I
will
cause
them
to
dwell
safely:
032:038
And
they
shall
be
my
people,
and
I
will
be
their
God:
032:039
And
I
will
give
them
one
heart,
and
one
way,
that
they
may
fear
me
for
ever,
for
the
good
of
them,
and
of
their
children
after
them:
032:040
And
I
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
them,
that
I
will
not
turn
away
from
them,
to
do
them
good;
but
I
will
put
my
fear
in
their
hearts,
that
they
shall
not
depart
from
me.
032:041
Yea,
I
will
rejoice
over
them
to
do
them
good,
and
I
will
plant
them
in
this
land
assuredly
with
my
whole
heart
and
with
my
whole
soul.
032:042
For
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Like
as
I
have
brought
all
this
great
evil
upon
this
people,
so
will
I
bring
upon
them
all
the
good
that
I
have
promised
them.
032:043
And
fields
shall
be
bought
in
this
land,
whereof
ye
say,
It
is
desolate
without
man
or
beast;
it
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans.
032:044
Men
shall
buy
fields
for
money,
and
subscribe
evidences,
and
seal
them,
and
take
witnesses
in
the
land
of
Benjamin,
and
in
the
places
about
Jerusalem,
and
in
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
in
the
cities
of
the
mountains,
and
in
the
cities
of
the
valley,
and
in
the
cities
of
the
south:
for
I
will
cause
their
captivity
to
return,
saith
the
LORD.
033:001
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Jeremiah
the
second
time,
while
he
was
yet
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
prison,
saying,
033:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD
the
maker
thereof,
the
LORD
that
formed
it,
to
establish
it;
the
LORD
is
his
name;
033:003
Call
unto
me,
and
I
will
answer
thee,
and
shew
thee
great
and
mighty
things,
which
thou
knowest
not.
033:004
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel,
concerning
the
houses
of
this
city,
and
concerning
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
Judah,
which
are
thrown
down
by
the
mounts,
and
by
the
sword;
033:005
They
come
to
fight
with
the
Chaldeans,
but
it
is
to
fill
them
with
the
dead
bodies
of
men,
whom
I
have
slain
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
fury,
and
for
all
whose
wickedness
I
have
hid
my
face
from
this
city.
033:006
Behold,
I
will
bring
it
health
and
cure,
and
I
will
cure
them,
and
will
reveal
unto
them
the
abundance
of
peace
and
truth.
033:007
And
I
will
cause
the
captivity
of
Judah
and
the
captivity
of
Israel
to
return,
and
will
build
them,
as
at
the
first.
033:008
And
I
will
cleanse
them
from
all
their
iniquity,
whereby
they
have
sinned
against
me;
and
I
will
pardon
all
their
iniquities,
whereby
they
have
sinned,
and
whereby
they
have
transgressed
against
me.
033:009
And
it
shall
be
to
me
a
name
of
joy,
a
praise
and
an
honour
before
all
the
nations
of
the
earth,
which
shall
hear
all
the
good
that
I
do
unto
them:
and
they
shall
fear
and
tremble
for
all
the
goodness
and
for
all
the
prosperity
that
I
procure
unto
it.
033:010
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Again
there
shall
be
heard
in
this
place,
which
ye
say
shall
be
desolate
without
man
and
without
beast,
even
in
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem,
that
are
desolate,
without
man,
and
without
inhabitant,
and
without
beast,
033:011
The
voice
of
joy,
and
the
voice
of
gladness,
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom,
and
the
voice
of
the
bride,
the
voice
of
them
that
shall
say,
Praise
the
LORD
of
hosts:
for
the
LORD
is
good;
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
and
of
them
that
shall
bring
the
sacrifice
of
praise
into
the
house
of
the
LORD.
For
I
will
cause
to
return
the
captivity
of
the
land,
as
at
the
first,
saith
the
LORD.
033:012
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Again
in
this
place,
which
is
desolate
without
man
and
without
beast,
and
in
all
the
cities
thereof,
shall
be
an
habitation
of
shepherds
causing
their
flocks
to
lie
down.
033:013
In
the
cities
of
the
mountains,
in
the
cities
of
the
vale,
and
in
the
cities
of
the
south,
and
in
the
land
of
Benjamin,
and
in
the
places
about
Jerusalem,
and
in
the
cities
of
Judah,
shall
the
flocks
pass
again
under
the
hands
of
him
that
telleth
them,
saith
the
LORD.
033:014
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
perform
that
good
thing
which
I
have
promised
unto
the
house
of
Israel
and
to
the
house
of
Judah.
033:015
In
those
days,
and
at
that
time,
will
I
cause
the
Branch
of
righteousness
to
grow
up
unto
David;
and
he
shall
execute
judgment
and
righteousness
in
the
land.
033:016
In
those
days
shall
Judah
be
saved,
and
Jerusalem
shall
dwell
safely:
and
this
is
the
name
wherewith
she
shall
be
called,
The
LORD
our
righteousness.
033:017
For
thus
saith
the
LORD;
David
shall
never
want
a
man
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
the
house
of
Israel;
033:018
Neither
shall
the
priests
the
Levites
want
a
man
before
me
to
offer
burnt
offerings,
and
to
kindle
meat
offerings,
and
to
do
sacrifice
continually.
033:019
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Jeremiah,
saying,
033:020
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
If
ye
can
break
my
covenant
of
the
day,
and
my
covenant
of
the
night,
and
that
there
should
not
be
day
and
night
in
their
season;
033:021
Then
may
also
my
covenant
be
broken
with
David
my
servant,
that
he
should
not
have
a
son
to
reign
upon
his
throne;
and
with
the
Levites
the
priests,
my
ministers.
033:022
As
the
host
of
heaven
cannot
be
numbered,
neither
the
sand
of
the
sea
measured:
so
will
I
multiply
the
seed
of
David
my
servant,
and
the
Levites
that
minister
unto
me.
033:023
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Jeremiah,
saying,
033:024
Considerest
thou
not
what
this
people
have
spoken,
saying,
The
two
families
which
the
LORD
hath
chosen,
he
hath
even
cast
them
off?
thus
they
have
despised
my
people,
that
they
should
be
no
more
a
nation
before
them.
033:025
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
If
my
covenant
be
not
with
day
and
night,
and
if
I
have
not
appointed
the
ordinances
of
heaven
and
earth;
033:026
Then
will
I
cast
away
the
seed
of
Jacob
and
David
my
servant,
so
that
I
will
not
take
any
of
his
seed
to
be
rulers
over
the
seed
of
Abraham,
Isaac,
and
Jacob:
for
I
will
cause
their
captivity
to
return,
and
have
mercy
on
them.
034:001
The
word
which
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
when
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon,
and
all
his
army,
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
of
his
dominion,
and
all
the
people,
fought
against
Jerusalem,
and
against
all
the
cities
thereof,
saying,
034:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel;
Go
and
speak
to
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah,
and
tell
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
he
shall
burn
it
with
fire:
034:003
And
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
his
hand,
but
shalt
surely
be
taken,
and
delivered
into
his
hand;
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
he
shall
speak
with
thee
mouth
to
mouth,
and
thou
shalt
go
to
Babylon.
034:004
Yet
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
O
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah;
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
thee,
Thou
shalt
not
die
by
the
sword:
034:005
But
thou
shalt
die
in
peace:
and
with
the
burnings
of
thy
fathers,
the
former
kings
which
were
before
thee,
so
shall
they
burn
odours
for
thee;
and
they
will
lament
thee,
saying,
Ah
lord!
for
I
have
pronounced
the
word,
saith
the
LORD.
034:006
Then
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
all
these
words
unto
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
in
Jerusalem,
034:007
When
the
king
of
Babylon's
army
fought
against
Jerusalem,
and
against
all
the
cities
of
Judah
that
were
left,
against
Lachish,
and
against
Azekah:
for
these
defenced
cities
