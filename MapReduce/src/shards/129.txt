remained
of
the
cities
of
Judah.
034:008
This
is
the
word
that
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
after
that
the
king
Zedekiah
had
made
a
covenant
with
all
the
people
which
were
at
Jerusalem,
to
proclaim
liberty
unto
them;
034:009
That
every
man
should
let
his
manservant,
and
every
man
his
maidservant,
being
an
Hebrew
or
an
Hebrewess,
go
free;
that
none
should
serve
himself
of
them,
to
wit,
of
a
Jew
his
brother.
034:010
Now
when
all
the
princes,
and
all
the
people,
which
had
entered
into
the
covenant,
heard
that
every
one
should
let
his
manservant,
and
every
one
his
maidservant,
go
free,
that
none
should
serve
themselves
of
them
any
more,
then
they
obeyed,
and
let
them
go.
034:011
But
afterward
they
turned,
and
caused
the
servants
and
the
handmaids,
whom
they
had
let
go
free,
to
return,
and
brought
them
into
subjection
for
servants
and
for
handmaids.
034:012
Therefore
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
saying,
034:013
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel;
I
made
a
covenant
with
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
I
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
out
of
the
house
of
bondmen,
saying,
034:014
At
the
end
of
seven
years
let
ye
go
every
man
his
brother
an
Hebrew,
which
hath
been
sold
unto
thee;
and
when
he
hath
served
thee
six
years,
thou
shalt
let
him
go
free
from
thee:
but
your
fathers
hearkened
not
unto
me,
neither
inclined
their
ear.
034:015
And
ye
were
now
turned,
and
had
done
right
in
my
sight,
in
proclaiming
liberty
every
man
to
his
neighbour;
and
ye
had
made
a
covenant
before
me
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
name:
034:016
But
ye
turned
and
polluted
my
name,
and
caused
every
man
his
servant,
and
every
man
his
handmaid,
whom
he
had
set
at
liberty
at
their
pleasure,
to
return,
and
brought
them
into
subjection,
to
be
unto
you
for
servants
and
for
handmaids.
034:017
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
me,
in
proclaiming
liberty,
every
one
to
his
brother,
and
every
man
to
his
neighbour:
behold,
I
proclaim
a
liberty
for
you,
saith
the
LORD,
to
the
sword,
to
the
pestilence,
and
to
the
famine;
and
I
will
make
you
to
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth.
034:018
And
I
will
give
the
men
that
have
transgressed
my
covenant,
which
have
not
performed
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
they
had
made
before
me,
when
they
cut
the
calf
in
twain,
and
passed
between
the
parts
thereof,
034:019
The
princes
of
Judah,
and
the
princes
of
Jerusalem,
the
eunuchs,
and
the
priests,
and
all
the
people
of
the
land,
which
passed
between
the
parts
of
the
calf;
034:020
I
will
even
give
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies,
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
their
life:
and
their
dead
bodies
shall
be
for
meat
unto
the
fowls
of
the
heaven,
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
earth.
034:021
And
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
and
his
princes
will
I
give
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies,
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
their
life,
and
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon's
army,
which
are
gone
up
from
you.
034:022
Behold,
I
will
command,
saith
the
LORD,
and
cause
them
to
return
to
this
city;
and
they
shall
fight
against
it,
and
take
it,
and
burn
it
with
fire:
and
I
will
make
the
cities
of
Judah
a
desolation
without
an
inhabitant.
035:001
The
word
which
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD
in
the
days
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah,
saying,
035:002
Go
unto
the
house
of
the
Rechabites,
and
speak
unto
them,
and
bring
them
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
into
one
of
the
chambers,
and
give
them
wine
to
drink.
035:003
Then
I
took
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
Jeremiah,
the
son
of
Habaziniah,
and
his
brethren,
and
all
his
sons,
and
the
whole
house
of
the
Rechabites;
035:004
And
I
brought
them
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
into
the
chamber
of
the
sons
of
Hanan,
the
son
of
Igdaliah,
a
man
of
God,
which
was
by
the
chamber
of
the
princes,
which
was
above
the
chamber
of
Maaseiah
the
son
of
Shallum,
the
keeper
of
the
door:
035:005
And
I
set
before
the
sons
of
the
house
of
the
Rechabites
pots
full
of
wine,
and
cups,
and
I
said
unto
them,
Drink
ye
wine.
035:006
But
they
said,
We
will
drink
no
wine:
for
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
our
father
commanded
us,
saying,
Ye
shall
drink
no
wine,
neither
ye,
nor
your
sons
for
ever:
035:007
Neither
shall
ye
build
house,
nor
sow
seed,
nor
plant
vineyard,
nor
have
any:
but
all
your
days
ye
shall
dwell
in
tents;
that
ye
may
live
many
days
in
the
land
where
ye
be
strangers.
035:008
Thus
have
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
our
father
in
all
that
he
hath
charged
us,
to
drink
no
wine
all
our
days,
we,
our
wives,
our
sons,
nor
our
daughters;
035:009
Nor
to
build
houses
for
us
to
dwell
in:
neither
have
we
vineyard,
nor
field,
nor
seed:
035:010
But
we
have
dwelt
in
tents,
and
have
obeyed,
and
done
according
to
all
that
Jonadab
our
father
commanded
us.
035:011
But
it
came
to
pass,
when
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
came
up
into
the
land,
that
we
said,
Come,
and
let
us
go
to
Jerusalem
for
fear
of
the
army
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
for
fear
of
the
army
of
the
Syrians:
so
we
dwell
at
Jerusalem.
035:012
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Jeremiah,
saying,
035:013
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Go
and
tell
the
men
of
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
Will
ye
not
receive
instruction
to
hearken
to
my
words?
saith
the
LORD.
035:014
The
words
of
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab,
that
he
commanded
his
sons
not
to
drink
wine,
are
performed;
for
unto
this
day
they
drink
none,
but
obey
their
father's
commandment:
notwithstanding
I
have
spoken
unto
you,
rising
early
and
speaking;
but
ye
hearkened
not
unto
me.
035:015
I
have
sent
also
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets,
rising
up
early
and
sending
them,
saying,
Return
ye
now
every
man
from
his
evil
way,
and
amend
your
doings,
and
go
not
after
other
gods
to
serve
them,
and
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
land
which
I
have
given
to
you
and
to
your
fathers:
but
ye
have
not
inclined
your
ear,
nor
hearkened
unto
me.
035:016
Because
the
sons
of
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
have
performed
the
commandment
of
their
father,
which
he
commanded
them;
but
this
people
hath
not
hearkened
unto
me:
035:017
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Behold,
I
will
bring
upon
Judah
and
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
all
the
evil
that
I
have
pronounced
against
them:
because
I
have
spoken
unto
them,
but
they
have
not
heard;
and
I
have
called
unto
them,
but
they
have
not
answered.
035:018
And
Jeremiah
said
unto
the
house
of
the
Rechabites,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Because
ye
have
obeyed
the
commandment
of
Jonadab
your
father,
and
kept
all
his
precepts,
and
done
according
unto
all
that
he
hath
commanded
you:
035:019
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
shall
not
want
a
man
to
stand
before
me
for
ever.
036:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah,
that
this
word
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
LORD,
saying,
036:002
Take
thee
a
roll
of
a
book,
and
write
therein
all
the
words
that
I
have
spoken
unto
thee
against
Israel,
and
against
Judah,
and
against
all
the
nations,
from
the
day
I
spake
unto
thee,
from
the
days
of
Josiah,
even
unto
this
day.
036:003
It
may
be
that
the
house
of
Judah
will
hear
all
the
evil
which
I
purpose
to
do
unto
them;
that
they
may
return
every
man
from
his
evil
way;
that
I
may
forgive
their
iniquity
and
their
sin.
036:004
Then
Jeremiah
called
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah:
and
Baruch
wrote
from
the
mouth
of
Jeremiah
all
the
words
of
the
LORD,
which
he
had
spoken
unto
him,
upon
a
roll
of
a
book.
036:005
And
Jeremiah
commanded
Baruch,
saying,
I
am
shut
up;
I
cannot
go
into
the
house
of
the
LORD:
036:006
Therefore
go
thou,
and
read
in
the
roll,
which
thou
hast
written
from
my
mouth,
the
words
of
the
LORD
in
the
ears
of
the
people
in
the
LORD's
house
upon
the
fasting
day:
and
also
thou
shalt
read
them
in
the
ears
of
all
Judah
that
come
out
of
their
cities.
036:007
It
may
be
they
will
present
their
supplication
before
the
LORD,
and
will
return
every
one
from
his
evil
way:
for
great
is
the
anger
and
the
fury
that
the
LORD
hath
pronounced
against
this
people.
036:008
And
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
did
according
to
all
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
him,
reading
in
the
book
the
words
of
the
LORD
in
the
LORD's
house.
036:009
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifth
year
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah,
in
the
ninth
month,
that
they
proclaimed
a
fast
before
the
LORD
to
all
the
people
in
Jerusalem,
and
to
all
the
people
that
came
from
the
cities
of
Judah
unto
Jerusalem.
036:010
Then
read
Baruch
in
the
book
the
words
of
Jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
in
the
chamber
of
Gemariah
the
son
of
Shaphan
the
scribe,
in
the
higher
court,
at
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
LORD's
house,
in
the
ears
of
all
the
people.
036:011
When
Michaiah
the
son
of
Gemariah,
the
son
of
Shaphan,
had
heard
out
of
the
book
all
the
words
of
the
LORD,
036:012
Then
he
went
down
into
the
king's
house,
into
the
scribe's
chamber:
and,
lo,
all
the
princes
sat
there,
even
Elishama
the
scribe,
and
Delaiah
the
son
of
Shemaiah,
and
Elnathan
the
son
of
Achbor,
and
Gemariah
the
son
of
Shaphan,
and
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Hananiah,
and
all
the
princes.
036:013
Then
Michaiah
declared
unto
them
all
the
words
that
he
had
heard,
when
Baruch
read
the
book
in
the
ears
of
the
people.
036:014
Therefore
all
the
princes
sent
Jehudi
the
son
of
Nethaniah,
the
son
of
Shelemiah,
the
son
of
Cushi,
unto
Baruch,
saying,
Take
in
thine
hand
the
roll
wherein
thou
hast
read
in
the
ears
of
the
people,
and
come.
So
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
took
the
roll
in
his
hand,
and
came
unto
them.
036:015
And
they
said
unto
him,
Sit
down
now,
and
read
it
in
our
ears.
So
Baruch
read
it
in
their
ears.
036:016
Now
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
had
heard
all
the
words,
they
were
afraid
both
one
and
other,
and
said
unto
Baruch,
We
will
surely
tell
the
king
of
all
these
words.
036:017
And
they
asked
Baruch,
saying,
Tell
us
now,
How
didst
thou
write
all
these
words
at
his
mouth?
036:018
Then
Baruch
answered
them,
He
pronounced
all
these
words
unto
me
with
his
mouth,
and
I
wrote
them
with
ink
in
the
book.
036:019
Then
said
the
princes
unto
Baruch,
Go,
hide
thee,
thou
and
Jeremiah;
and
let
no
man
know
where
ye
be.
036:020
And
they
went
in
to
the
king
into
the
court,
but
they
laid
up
the
roll
in
the
chamber
of
Elishama
the
scribe,
and
told
all
the
words
in
the
ears
of
the
king.
036:021
So
the
king
sent
Jehudi
to
fetch
the
roll:
and
he
took
it
out
of
Elishama
the
scribe's
chamber.
And
Jehudi
read
it
in
the
ears
of
the
king,
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
princes
which
stood
beside
the
king.
036:022
Now
the
king
sat
in
the
winterhouse
in
the
ninth
month:
and
there
was
a
fire
on
the
hearth
burning
before
him.
036:023
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
Jehudi
had
read
three
or
four
leaves,
he
cut
it
with
the
penknife,
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
that
was
on
the
hearth,
until
all
the
roll
was
consumed
in
the
fire
that
was
on
the
hearth.
036:024
Yet
they
were
not
afraid,
nor
rent
their
garments,
neither
the
king,
nor
any
of
his
servants
that
heard
all
these
words.
036:025
Nevertheless
Elnathan
and
Delaiah
and
Gemariah
had
made
intercession
to
the
king
that
he
would
not
burn
the
roll:
but
he
would
not
hear
them.
036:026
But
the
king
commanded
Jerahmeel
the
son
of
Hammelech,
and
Seraiah
the
son
of
Azriel,
and
Shelemiah
the
son
of
Abdeel,
to
take
Baruch
the
scribe
and
Jeremiah
the
prophet:
but
the
LORD
hid
them.
036:027
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Jeremiah,
after
that
the
king
had
burned
the
roll,
and
the
words
which
Baruch
wrote
at
the
mouth
of
Jeremiah,
saying,
036:028
Take
thee
again
another
roll,
and
write
in
it
all
the
former
words
that
were
in
the
first
roll,
which
Jehoiakim
the
king
of
Judah
hath
burned.
036:029
And
thou
shalt
say
to
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Thou
hast
burned
this
roll,
saying,
Why
hast
thou
written
therein,
saying,
The
king
of
Babylon
shall
certainly
come
and
destroy
this
land,
and
shall
cause
to
cease
from
thence
man
and
beast?
036:030
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah;
He
shall
have
none
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
David:
and
his
dead
body
shall
be
cast
out
in
the
day
to
the
heat,
and
in
the
night
to
the
frost.
036:031
And
I
will
punish
him
and
his
seed
and
his
servants
for
their
iniquity;
and
I
will
bring
upon
them,
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
and
upon
the
men
of
Judah,
all
the
evil
that
I
have
pronounced
against
them;
but
they
hearkened
not.
036:032
Then
took
Jeremiah
another
roll,
and
gave
it
to
Baruch
the
scribe,
the
son
of
Neriah;
who
wrote
therein
from
the
mouth
of
Jeremiah
all
the
words
of
the
book
which
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah
had
burned
in
the
fire:
and
there
were
added
besides
unto
them
many
like
words.
037:001
And
king
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Josiah
reigned
instead
of
Coniah
the
son
of
Jehoiakim,
whom
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
made
king
in
the
land
of
Judah.
037:002
But
neither
he,
nor
his
servants,
nor
the
people
of
the
land,
did
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
by
the
prophet
Jeremiah.
037:003
And
Zedekiah
the
king
sent
Jehucal
the
son
of
Shelemiah
and
Zephaniah
the
son
of
Maaseiah
the
priest
to
the
prophet
Jeremiah,
saying,
Pray
now
unto
the
LORD
our
God
for
us.
037:004
Now
Jeremiah
came
in
and
went
out
among
the
people:
for
they
had
not
put
him
into
prison.
037:005
Then
Pharaoh's
army
was
come
forth
out
of
Egypt:
and
when
the
Chaldeans
that
besieged
Jerusalem
heard
tidings
of
them,
they
departed
from
Jerusalem.
037:006
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
the
prophet
Jeremiah
saying,
037:007
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel;
Thus
shall
ye
say
to
the
king
of
Judah,
that
sent
you
unto
me
to
enquire
of
me;
Behold,
Pharaoh's
army,
which
is
come
forth
to
help
you,
shall
return
to
Egypt
into
their
own
land.
037:008
And
the
Chaldeans
shall
come
again,
and
fight
against
this
city,
and
take
it,
and
burn
it
with
fire.
037:009
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Deceive
not
yourselves,
saying,
The
Chaldeans
shall
surely
depart
from
us:
for
they
shall
not
depart.
037:010
For
though
ye
had
smitten
the
whole
army
of
the
Chaldeans
that
fight
against
you,
and
there
remained
but
wounded
men
among
them,
yet
should
they
rise
up
every
man
in
his
tent,
and
burn
this
city
with
fire.
037:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
the
army
of
the
Chaldeans
was
broken
up
from
Jerusalem
for
fear
of
Pharaoh's
army,
037:012
Then
Jeremiah
went
forth
out
of
Jerusalem
to
go
into
the
land
of
Benjamin,
to
separate
himself
thence
in
the
midst
of
the
people.
037:013
And
when
he
was
in
the
gate
of
Benjamin,
a
captain
of
the
ward
was
there,
whose
name
was
Irijah,
the
son
of
Shelemiah,
the
son
of
Hananiah;
and
he
took
Jeremiah
the
prophet,
saying,
Thou
fallest
away
to
the
Chaldeans.
037:014
Then
said
Jeremiah,
It
is
false;
I
fall
not
away
to
the
Chaldeans.
But
he
hearkened
not
to
him:
so
Irijah
took
Jeremiah,
and
brought
him
to
the
princes.
037:015
Wherefore
the
princes
were
wroth
with
Jeremiah,
and
smote
him,
and
put
him
in
prison
in
the
house
of
Jonathan
the
scribe:
for
they
had
made
that
the
prison.
037:016
When
Jeremiah
was
entered
into
the
dungeon,
and
into
the
cabins,
and
Jeremiah
had
remained
there
many
days;
037:017
Then
Zedekiah
the
king
sent,
and
took
him
out:
and
the
king
asked
him
secretly
in
his
house,
and
said,
Is
there
any
word
from
the
LORD?
And
Jeremiah
said,
There
is:
for,
said
he,
thou
shalt
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon.
037:018
Moreover
Jeremiah
said
unto
king
Zedekiah,
What
have
I
offended
against
thee,
or
against
thy
servants,
or
against
this
people,
that
ye
have
put
me
in
prison?
037:019
Where
are
now
your
prophets
which
prophesied
unto
you,
saying,
The
king
of
Babylon
shall
not
come
against
you,
nor
against
this
land?
037:020
Therefore
hear
now,
I
pray
thee,
O
my
lord
the
king:
let
my
supplication,
I
pray
thee,
be
accepted
before
thee;
that
thou
cause
me
not
to
return
to
the
house
of
Jonathan
the
scribe,
lest
I
die
there.
037:021
Then
Zedekiah
the
king
commanded
that
they
should
commit
Jeremiah
into
the
court
of
the
prison,
and
that
they
should
give
him
daily
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
the
bakers'
street,
until
all
the
bread
in
the
city
were
spent.
Thus
Jeremiah
remained
in
the
court
of
the
prison.
038:001
Then
Shephatiah
the
son
of
Mattan,
and
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Pashur,
and
Jucal
the
son
of
Shelemiah,
and
Pashur
the
son
of
Malchiah,
heard
the
words
that
Jeremiah
had
spoken
unto
all
the
people,
saying,
038:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
He
that
remaineth
in
this
city
shall
die
by
the
sword,
by
the
famine,
and
by
the
pestilence:
but
he
that
goeth
forth
to
the
Chaldeans
shall
live;
for
he
shall
have
his
life
for
a
prey,
and
shall
live.
038:003
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
This
city
shall
surely
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon's
army,
which
shall
take
it.
038:004
Therefore
the
princes
said
unto
the
king,
We
beseech
thee,
let
this
man
be
put
to
death:
for
thus
he
weakeneth
the
hands
of
the
men
of
war
that
remain
in
this
city,
and
the
hands
of
all
the
people,
in
speaking
such
words
unto
them:
for
this
man
seeketh
not
the
welfare
of
this
people,
but
the
hurt.
038:005
Then
Zedekiah
the
king
said,
Behold,
he
is
in
your
hand:
for
the
king
is
not
he
that
can
do
any
thing
against
you.
038:006
Then
took
they
Jeremiah,
and
cast
him
into
the
dungeon
of
Malchiah
the
son
of
Hammelech,
that
was
in
the
court
of
the
prison:
and
they
let
down
Jeremiah
with
cords.
And
in
the
dungeon
there
was
no
water,
but
mire:
so
Jeremiah
sunk
in
the
mire.
038:007
Now
when
Ebedmelech
the
Ethiopian,
one
of
the
eunuchs
which
was
in
the
king's
house,
heard
that
they
had
put
Jeremiah
in
the
dungeon;
the
king
then
sitting
in
the
gate
of
Benjamin;
038:008
Ebedmelech
went
forth
out
of
the
king's
house,
and
spake
to
the
king
saying,
038:009
My
lord
the
king,
these
men
have
done
evil
in
all
that
they
have
done
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet,
whom
they
have
cast
into
the
dungeon;
and
he
is
like
to
die
for
hunger
in
the
place
where
he
is:
for
there
is
no
more
bread
in
the
city.
038:010
Then
the
king
commanded
Ebedmelech
the
Ethiopian,
saying,
Take
from
hence
thirty
men
with
thee,
and
take
up
Jeremiah
the
prophet
out
of
the
dungeon,
before
he
die.
038:011
So
Ebedmelech
took
the
men
with
him,
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
king
under
the
treasury,
and
took
thence
old
cast
clouts
and
old
rotten
rags,
and
let
them
down
by
cords
into
the
dungeon
to
Jeremiah.
038:012
And
Ebedmelech
the
Ethiopian
said
unto
Jeremiah,
Put
now
these
old
cast
clouts
and
rotten
rags
under
thine
armholes
under
the
cords.
And
Jeremiah
did
so.
038:013
So
they
drew
up
Jeremiah
with
cords,
and
took
him
up
out
of
the
dungeon:
and
Jeremiah
remained
in
the
court
of
the
prison.
038:014
Then
Zedekiah
the
king
sent,
and
took
Jeremiah
the
prophet
unto
him
into
the
third
entry
that
is
in
the
house
of
the
LORD:
and
the
king
said
unto
Jeremiah,
I
will
ask
thee
a
thing;
hide
nothing
from
me.
038:015
Then
Jeremiah
said
unto
Zedekiah,
If
I
declare
it
unto
thee,
wilt
thou
not
surely
put
me
to
death?
and
if
I
give
thee
counsel,
wilt
thou
not
hearken
unto
me?
038:016
So
Zedekiah
the
king
sware
secretly
unto
Jeremiah,
saying,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
that
made
us
this
soul,
I
will
not
put
thee
to
death,
neither
will
I
give
thee
into
the
hand
of
these
men
that
seek
thy
life.
038:017
Then
said
Jeremiah
unto
Zedekiah,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
If
thou
wilt
assuredly
go
forth
unto
the
king
of
Babylon's
princes,
then
thy
soul
shall
live,
and
this
city
shall
not
be
burned
with
fire;
and
thou
shalt
live,
and
thine
house:
038:018
But
if
thou
wilt
not
go
forth
to
the
king
of
Babylon's
princes,
then
shall
this
city
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
they
shall
burn
it
with
fire,
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
their
hand.
038:019
And
Zedekiah
the
king
said
unto
Jeremiah,
I
am
afraid
of
the
Jews
that
are
fallen
to
the
Chaldeans,
lest
they
deliver
me
into
their
hand,
and
they
mock
me.
038:020
But
Jeremiah
said,
They
shall
not
deliver
thee.
Obey,
I
beseech
thee,
the
voice
of
the
LORD,
which
I
speak
unto
thee:
so
it
shall
be
well
unto
thee,
and
thy
soul
shall
live.
038:021
But
if
thou
refuse
to
go
forth,
this
is
the
word
that
the
LORD
hath
shewed
me:
038:022
And,
behold,
all
the
women
that
are
left
in
the
king
of
Judah's
house
shall
be
brought
forth
to
the
king
of
Babylon's
princes,
and
those
women
shall
say,
Thy
friends
have
set
thee
on,
and
have
prevailed
against
thee:
thy
feet
are
sunk
in
the
mire,
and
they
are
turned
away
back.
038:023
So
they
shall
bring
out
all
thy
wives
and
thy
children
to
the
Chaldeans:
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
their
hand,
but
shalt
be
taken
by
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon:
and
thou
shalt
cause
this
city
to
be
burned
with
fire.
038:024
Then
said
Zedekiah
unto
Jeremiah,
Let
no
man
know
of
these
words,
and
thou
shalt
not
die.
038:025
But
if
the
princes
hear
that
I
have
talked
with
thee,
and
they
come
unto
thee,
and
say
unto
thee,
Declare
unto
us
now
what
thou
hast
said
unto
the
king,
hide
it
not
from
us,
and
we
will
not
put
thee
to
death;
also
what
the
king
said
unto
thee:
038:026
Then
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
I
presented
my
supplication
before
the
king,
that
he
would
not
cause
me
to
return
to
Jonathan's
house,
to
die
there.
038:027
Then
came
all
the
princes
unto
Jeremiah,
and
asked
him:
and
he
told
them
according
to
all
these
words
that
the
king
had
commanded.
So
they
left
off
speaking
with
him;
for
the
matter
was
not
perceived.
038:028
So
Jeremiah
abode
in
the
court
of
the
prison
until
the
day
that
Jerusalem
was
taken:
and
he
was
there
when
Jerusalem
was
taken.
039:001
In
the
ninth
year
of
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah,
in
the
tenth
month,
came
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
and
all
his
army
against
Jerusalem,
and
they
besieged
it.
039:002
And
in
the
eleventh
year
of
Zedekiah,
in
the
