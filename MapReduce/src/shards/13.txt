commanded
Moses,
so
Aaron
laid
it
up
before
the
Testimony,
to
be
kept.
016:035
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
eat
manna
forty
years,
until
they
came
to
a
land
inhabited;
they
did
eat
manna,
until
they
came
unto
the
borders
of
the
land
of
Canaan.
016:036
Now
an
omer
is
the
tenth
part
of
an
ephah.
017:001
And
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
journeyed
from
the
wilderness
of
Sin,
after
their
journeys,
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
and
pitched
in
Rephidim:
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
people
to
drink.
017:002
Wherefore
the
people
did
chide
with
Moses,
and
said,
Give
us
water
that
we
may
drink.
And
Moses
said
unto
them,
Why
chide
ye
with
me?
wherefore
do
ye
tempt
the
LORD?
017:003
And
the
people
thirsted
there
for
water;
and
the
people
murmured
against
Moses,
and
said,
Wherefore
is
this
that
thou
hast
brought
us
up
out
of
Egypt,
to
kill
us
and
our
children
and
our
cattle
with
thirst?
017:004
And
Moses
cried
unto
the
LORD,
saying,
What
shall
I
do
unto
this
people?
they
be
almost
ready
to
stone
me.
017:005
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Go
on
before
the
people,
and
take
with
thee
of
the
elders
of
Israel;
and
thy
rod,
wherewith
thou
smotest
the
river,
take
in
thine
hand,
and
go.
017:006
Behold,
I
will
stand
before
thee
there
upon
the
rock
in
Horeb;
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
rock,
and
there
shall
come
water
out
of
it,
that
the
people
may
drink.
And
Moses
did
so
in
the
sight
of
the
elders
of
Israel.
017:007
And
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
Massah,
and
Meribah,
because
of
the
chiding
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
because
they
tempted
the
LORD,
saying,
Is
the
LORD
among
us,
or
not?
017:008
Then
came
Amalek,
and
fought
with
Israel
in
Rephidim.
017:009
And
Moses
said
unto
Joshua,
Choose
us
out
men,
and
go
out,
fight
with
Amalek:
to
morrow
I
will
stand
on
the
top
of
the
hill
with
the
rod
of
God
in
mine
hand.
017:010
So
Joshua
did
as
Moses
had
said
to
him,
and
fought
with
Amalek:
and
Moses,
Aaron,
and
Hur
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill.
017:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Moses
held
up
his
hand,
that
Israel
prevailed:
and
when
he
let
down
his
hand,
Amalek
prevailed.
017:012
But
Moses
hands
were
heavy;
and
they
took
a
stone,
and
put
it
under
him,
and
he
sat
thereon;
and
Aaron
and
Hur
stayed
up
his
hands,
the
one
on
the
one
side,
and
the
other
on
the
other
side;
and
his
hands
were
steady
until
the
going
down
of
the
sun.
017:013
And
Joshua
discomfited
Amalek
and
his
people
with
the
edge
of
the
sword.
017:014
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Write
this
for
a
memorial
in
a
book,
and
rehearse
it
in
the
ears
of
Joshua:
for
I
will
utterly
put
out
the
remembrance
of
Amalek
from
under
heaven.
017:015
And
Moses
built
an
altar,
and
called
the
name
of
it
Jehovahnissi:
017:016
For
he
said,
Because
the
LORD
hath
sworn
that
the
LORD
will
have
war
with
Amalek
from
generation
to
generation.
018:001
When
Jethro,
the
priest
of
Midian,
Moses'
father
in
law,
heard
of
all
that
God
had
done
for
Moses,
and
for
Israel
his
people,
and
that
the
LORD
had
brought
Israel
out
of
Egypt;
018:002
Then
Jethro,
Moses'
father
in
law,
took
Zipporah,
Moses'
wife,
after
he
had
sent
her
back,
018:003
And
her
two
sons;
of
which
the
name
of
the
one
was
Gershom;
for
he
said,
I
have
been
an
alien
in
a
strange
land:
018:004
And
the
name
of
the
other
was
Eliezer;
for
the
God
of
my
father,
said
he,
was
mine
help,
and
delivered
me
from
the
sword
of
Pharaoh:
018:005
And
Jethro,
Moses'
father
in
law,
came
with
his
sons
and
his
wife
unto
Moses
into
the
wilderness,
where
he
encamped
at
the
mount
of
God:
018:006
And
he
said
unto
Moses,
I
thy
father
in
law
Jethro
am
come
unto
thee,
and
thy
wife,
and
her
two
sons
with
her.
018:007
And
Moses
went
out
to
meet
his
father
in
law,
and
did
obeisance,
and
kissed
him;
and
they
asked
each
other
of
their
welfare;
and
they
came
into
the
tent.
018:008
And
Moses
told
his
father
in
law
all
that
the
LORD
had
done
unto
Pharaoh
and
to
the
Egyptians
for
Israel's
sake,
and
all
the
travail
that
had
come
upon
them
by
the
way,
and
how
the
LORD
delivered
them.
018:009
And
Jethro
rejoiced
for
all
the
goodness
which
the
LORD
had
done
to
Israel,
whom
he
had
delivered
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians.
018:010
And
Jethro
said,
Blessed
be
the
LORD,
who
hath
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians,
and
out
of
the
hand
of
Pharaoh,
who
hath
delivered
the
people
from
under
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians.
018:011
Now
I
know
that
the
LORD
is
greater
than
all
gods:
for
in
the
thing
wherein
they
dealt
proudly
he
was
above
them.
018:012
And
Jethro,
Moses'
father
in
law,
took
a
burnt
offering
and
sacrifices
for
God:
and
Aaron
came,
and
all
the
elders
of
Israel,
to
eat
bread
with
Moses'
father
in
law
before
God.
018:013
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
Moses
sat
to
judge
the
people:
and
the
people
stood
by
Moses
from
the
morning
unto
the
evening.
018:014
And
when
Moses'
father
in
law
saw
all
that
he
did
to
the
people,
he
said,
What
is
this
thing
that
thou
doest
to
the
people?
why
sittest
thou
thyself
alone,
and
all
the
people
stand
by
thee
from
morning
unto
even?
018:015
And
Moses
said
unto
his
father
in
law,
Because
the
people
come
unto
me
to
enquire
of
God:
018:016
When
they
have
a
matter,
they
come
unto
me;
and
I
judge
between
one
and
another,
and
I
do
make
them
know
the
statutes
of
God,
and
his
laws.
018:017
And
Moses'
father
in
law
said
unto
him,
The
thing
that
thou
doest
is
not
good.
018:018
Thou
wilt
surely
wear
away,
both
thou,
and
this
people
that
is
with
thee:
for
this
thing
is
too
heavy
for
thee;
thou
art
not
able
to
perform
it
thyself
alone.
018:019
Hearken
now
unto
my
voice,
I
will
give
thee
counsel,
and
God
shall
be
with
thee:
Be
thou
for
the
people
to
God-ward,
that
thou
mayest
bring
the
causes
unto
God:
018:020
And
thou
shalt
teach
them
ordinances
and
laws,
and
shalt
shew
them
the
way
wherein
they
must
walk,
and
the
work
that
they
must
do.
018:021
Moreover
thou
shalt
provide
out
of
all
the
people
able
men,
such
as
fear
God,
men
of
truth,
hating
covetousness;
and
place
such
over
them,
to
be
rulers
of
thousands,
and
rulers
of
hundreds,
rulers
of
fifties,
and
rulers
of
tens:
018:022
And
let
them
judge
the
people
at
all
seasons:
and
it
shall
be,
that
every
great
matter
they
shall
bring
unto
thee,
but
every
small
matter
they
shall
judge:
so
shall
it
be
easier
for
thyself,
and
they
shall
bear
the
burden
with
thee.
018:023
If
thou
shalt
do
this
thing,
and
God
command
thee
so,
then
thou
shalt
be
able
to
endure,
and
all
this
people
shall
also
go
to
their
place
in
peace.
018:024
So
Moses
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
his
father
in
law,
and
did
all
that
he
had
said.
018:025
And
Moses
chose
able
men
out
of
all
Israel,
and
made
them
heads
over
the
people,
rulers
of
thousands,
rulers
of
hundreds,
rulers
of
fifties,
and
rulers
of
tens.
018:026
And
they
judged
the
people
at
all
seasons:
the
hard
causes
they
brought
unto
Moses,
but
every
small
matter
they
judged
themselves.
018:027
And
Moses
let
his
father
in
law
depart;
and
he
went
his
way
into
his
own
land.
019:001
In
the
third
month,
when
the
children
of
Israel
were
gone
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
the
same
day
came
they
into
the
wilderness
of
Sinai.
019:002
For
they
were
departed
from
Rephidim,
and
were
come
to
the
desert
of
Sinai,
and
had
pitched
in
the
wilderness;
and
there
Israel
camped
before
the
mount.
019:003
And
Moses
went
up
unto
God,
and
the
LORD
called
unto
him
out
of
the
mountain,
saying,
Thus
shalt
thou
say
to
the
house
of
Jacob,
and
tell
the
children
of
Israel;
019:004
Ye
have
seen
what
I
did
unto
the
Egyptians,
and
how
I
bare
you
on
eagles'
wings,
and
brought
you
unto
myself.
019:005
Now
therefore,
if
ye
will
obey
my
voice
indeed,
and
keep
my
covenant,
then
ye
shall
be
a
peculiar
treasure
unto
me
above
all
people:
for
all
the
earth
is
mine:
019:006
And
ye
shall
be
unto
me
a
kingdom
of
priests,
and
an
holy
nation.
These
are
the
words
which
thou
shalt
speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel.
019:007
And
Moses
came
and
called
for
the
elders
of
the
people,
and
laid
before
their
faces
all
these
words
which
the
LORD
commanded
him.
019:008
And
all
the
people
answered
together,
and
said,
All
that
the
LORD
hath
spoken
we
will
do.
And
Moses
returned
the
words
of
the
people
unto
the
LORD.
019:009
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Lo,
I
come
unto
thee
in
a
thick
cloud,
that
the
people
may
hear
when
I
speak
with
thee,
and
believe
thee
for
ever.
And
Moses
told
the
words
of
the
people
unto
the
LORD.
019:010
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Go
unto
the
people,
and
sanctify
them
to
day
and
to
morrow,
and
let
them
wash
their
clothes,
019:011
And
be
ready
against
the
third
day:
for
the
third
day
the
LORD
will
come
down
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
upon
mount
Sinai.
019:012
And
thou
shalt
set
bounds
unto
the
people
round
about,
saying,
Take
heed
to
yourselves,
that
ye
go
not
up
into
the
mount,
or
touch
the
border
of
it:
whosoever
toucheth
the
mount
shall
be
surely
put
to
death:
019:013
There
shall
not
an
hand
touch
it,
but
he
shall
surely
be
stoned,
or
shot
through;
whether
it
be
beast
or
man,
it
shall
not
live:
when
the
trumpet
soundeth
long,
they
shall
come
up
to
the
mount.
019:014
And
Moses
went
down
from
the
mount
unto
the
people,
and
sanctified
the
people;
and
they
washed
their
clothes.
019:015
And
he
said
unto
the
people,
Be
ready
against
the
third
day:
come
not
at
your
wives.
019:016
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
day
in
the
morning,
that
there
were
thunders
and
lightnings,
and
a
thick
cloud
upon
the
mount,
and
the
voice
of
the
trumpet
exceeding
loud;
so
that
all
the
people
that
was
in
the
camp
trembled.
019:017
And
Moses
brought
forth
the
people
out
of
the
camp
to
meet
with
God;
and
they
stood
at
the
nether
part
of
the
mount.
019:018
And
mount
Sinai
was
altogether
on
a
smoke,
because
the
LORD
descended
upon
it
in
fire:
and
the
smoke
thereof
ascended
as
the
smoke
of
a
furnace,
and
the
whole
mount
quaked
greatly.
019:019
And
when
the
voice
of
the
trumpet
sounded
long,
and
waxed
louder
and
louder,
Moses
spake,
and
God
answered
him
by
a
voice.
019:020
And
the
LORD
came
down
upon
mount
Sinai,
on
the
top
of
the
mount:
and
the
LORD
called
Moses
up
to
the
top
of
the
mount;
and
Moses
went
up.
019:021
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Go
down,
charge
the
people,
lest
they
break
through
unto
the
LORD
to
gaze,
and
many
of
them
perish.
019:022
And
let
the
priests
also,
which
come
near
to
the
LORD,
sanctify
themselves,
lest
the
LORD
break
forth
upon
them.
019:023
And
Moses
said
unto
the
LORD,
The
people
cannot
come
up
to
mount
Sinai:
for
thou
chargedst
us,
saying,
Set
bounds
about
the
mount,
and
sanctify
it.
019:024
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Away,
get
thee
down,
and
thou
shalt
come
up,
thou,
and
Aaron
with
thee:
but
let
not
the
priests
and
the
people
break
through
to
come
up
unto
the
LORD,
lest
he
break
forth
upon
them.
019:025
So
Moses
went
down
unto
the
people,
and
spake
unto
them.
020:001
And
God
spake
all
these
words,
saying,
020:002
I
am
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
have
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
out
of
the
house
of
bondage.
020:003
Thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
me.
020:004
Thou
shalt
not
make
unto
thee
any
graven
image,
or
any
likeness
of
any
thing
that
is
in
heaven
above,
or
that
is
in
the
earth
beneath,
or
that
is
in
the
water
under
the
earth.
020:005
Thou
shalt
not
bow
down
thyself
to
them,
nor
serve
them:
for
I
the
LORD
thy
God
am
a
jealous
God,
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
me;
020:006
And
shewing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me,
and
keep
my
commandments.
020:007
Thou
shalt
not
take
the
name
of
the
LORD
thy
God
in
vain;
for
the
LORD
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
that
taketh
his
name
in
vain.
020:008
Remember
the
sabbath
day,
to
keep
it
holy.
020:009
Six
days
shalt
thou
labour,
and
do
all
thy
work:
020:010
But
the
seventh
day
is
the
sabbath
of
the
LORD
thy
God:
in
it
thou
shalt
not
do
any
work,
thou,
nor
thy
son,
nor
thy
daughter,
thy
manservant,
nor
thy
maidservant,
nor
thy
cattle,
nor
thy
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates:
020:011
For
in
six
days
the
LORD
made
heaven
and
earth,
the
sea,
and
all
that
in
them
is,
and
rested
the
seventh
day:
wherefore
the
LORD
blessed
the
sabbath
day,
and
hallowed
it.
020:012
Honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother:
that
thy
days
may
be
long
upon
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee.
020:013
Thou
shalt
not
kill.
020:014
Thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery.
020:015
Thou
shalt
not
steal.
020:016
Thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbour.
020:017
Thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbour's
house,
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbour's
wife,
nor
his
manservant,
nor
his
maidservant,
nor
his
ox,
nor
his
ass,
nor
any
thing
that
is
thy
neighbour's.
020:018
And
all
the
people
saw
the
thunderings,
and
the
lightnings,
and
the
noise
of
the
trumpet,
and
the
mountain
smoking:
and
when
the
people
saw
it,
they
removed,
and
stood
afar
off.
020:019
And
they
said
unto
Moses,
Speak
thou
with
us,
and
we
will
hear:
but
let
not
God
speak
with
us,
lest
we
die.
020:020
And
Moses
said
unto
the
people,
Fear
not:
for
God
is
come
to
prove
you,
and
that
his
fear
may
be
before
your
faces,
that
ye
sin
not.
020:021
And
the
people
stood
afar
off,
and
Moses
drew
near
unto
the
thick
darkness
where
God
was.
020:022
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Thus
thou
shalt
say
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
Ye
have
seen
that
I
have
talked
with
you
from
heaven.
020:023
Ye
shall
not
make
with
me
gods
of
silver,
neither
shall
ye
make
unto
you
gods
of
gold.
020:024
An
altar
of
earth
thou
shalt
make
unto
me,
and
shalt
sacrifice
thereon
thy
burnt
offerings,
and
thy
peace
offerings,
thy
sheep,
and
thine
oxen:
in
all
places
where
I
record
my
name
I
will
come
unto
thee,
and
I
will
bless
thee.
020:025
And
if
thou
wilt
make
me
an
altar
of
stone,
thou
shalt
not
build
it
of
hewn
stone:
for
if
thou
lift
up
thy
tool
upon
it,
thou
hast
polluted
it.
020:026
Neither
shalt
thou
go
up
by
steps
unto
mine
altar,
that
thy
nakedness
be
not
discovered
thereon.
021:001
Now
these
are
the
judgments
which
thou
shalt
set
before
them.
021:002
If
thou
buy
an
Hebrew
servant,
six
years
he
shall
serve:
and
in
the
seventh
he
shall
go
out
free
for
nothing.
021:003
If
he
came
in
by
himself,
he
shall
go
out
by
himself:
if
he
were
married,
then
his
wife
shall
go
out
with
him.
021:004
If
his
master
have
given
him
a
wife,
and
she
have
born
him
sons
or
daughters;
the
wife
and
her
children
shall
be
her
master's,
and
he
shall
go
out
by
himself.
021:005
And
if
the
servant
shall
plainly
say,
I
love
my
master,
my
wife,
and
my
children;
I
will
not
go
out
free:
021:006
Then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the
judges;
he
shall
also
bring
him
to
the
door,
or
unto
the
door
post;
and
his
master
shall
bore
his
ear
through
with
an
aul;
and
he
shall
serve
him
for
ever.
021:007
And
if
a
man
sell
his
daughter
to
be
a
maidservant,
she
shall
not
go
out
as
the
menservants
do.
021:008
If
she
please
not
her
master,
who
hath
betrothed
her
to
himself,
then
shall
he
let
her
be
redeemed:
to
sell
her
unto
a
strange
nation
he
shall
have
no
power,
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her.
021:009
And
if
he
have
betrothed
her
unto
his
son,
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters.
021:010
If
he
take
him
another
wife;
her
food,
her
raiment,
and
her
duty
of
marriage,
shall
he
not
diminish.
021:011
And
if
he
do
not
these
three
unto
her,
then
shall
she
go
out
free
without
money.
021:012
He
that
smiteth
a
man,
so
that
he
die,
shall
be
surely
put
to
death.
021:013
And
if
a
man
lie
not
in
wait,
but
God
deliver
him
into
his
hand;
then
I
will
appoint
thee
a
place
whither
he
shall
flee.
021:014
But
if
a
man
come
presumptuously
upon
his
neighbour,
to
slay
him
with
guile;
thou
shalt
take
him
from
mine
altar,
that
he
may
die.
021:015
And
he
that
smiteth
his
father,
or
his
mother,
shall
be
surely
put
to
death.
021:016
And
he
that
stealeth
a
man,
and
selleth
him,
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hand,
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
021:017
And
he
that
curseth
his
father,
or
his
mother,
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
021:018
And
if
men
strive
together,
and
one
smite
another
with
a
stone,
or
with
his
fist,
and
he
die
not,
but
keepeth
his
bed:
021:019
If
he
rise
again,
and
walk
abroad
upon
his
staff,
then
shall
he
that
smote
him
be
quit:
only
he
shall
pay
for
the
loss
of
his
time,
and
shall
cause
him
to
be
thoroughly
healed.
021:020
And
if
a
man
smite
his
servant,
or
his
maid,
with
a
rod,
and
he
die
under
his
hand;
he
shall
be
surely
punished.
021:021
Notwithstanding,
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two,
he
shall
not
be
punished:
for
he
is
his
money.
021:022
If
men
strive,
and
hurt
a
woman
with
child,
so
that
her
fruit
depart
from
her,
and
yet
no
mischief
follow:
he
shall
be
surely
punished,
according
as
the
woman's
husband
will
lay
upon
him;
and
he
shall
pay
as
the
judges
determine.
021:023
And
if
any
mischief
follow,
then
thou
shalt
give
life
for
life,
021:024
Eye
for
eye,
tooth
for
tooth,
hand
for
hand,
foot
for
foot,
021:025
Burning
for
burning,
wound
for
wound,
stripe
for
stripe.
021:026
And
if
a
man
smite
the
eye
of
his
servant,
or
the
eye
of
his
maid,
that
it
perish;
he
shall
let
him
go
free
for
his
eye's
sake.
021:027
And
if
he
smite
out
his
manservant's
tooth,
or
his
maidservant's
tooth;
he
shall
let
him
go
free
for
his
tooth's
sake.
021:028
If
an
ox
gore
a
man
or
a
woman,
that
they
die:
then
the
ox
shall
be
surely
stoned,
and
his
flesh
shall
not
be
eaten;
but
the
owner
of
the
ox
shall
be
quit.
021:029
But
if
the
ox
were
wont
to
push
with
his
horn
in
time
past,
and
it
hath
been
testified
to
his
owner,
and
he
hath
not
kept
him
in,
but
that
he
hath
killed
a
man
or
a
woman;
the
ox
shall
be
stoned,
and
his
owner
also
shall
be
put
to
death.
021:030
If
there
be
laid
on
him
a
sum
of
money,
then
he
shall
give
for
the
ransom
of
his
life
whatsoever
is
laid
upon
him.
021:031
Whether
he
have
gored
a
son,
or
have
gored
a
daughter,
according
to
this
judgment
shall
it
be
done
unto
him.
021:032
If
the
ox
shall
push
a
manservant
or
a
maidservant;
he
shall
give
unto
their
master
thirty
shekels
of
silver,
and
the
ox
shall
be
stoned.
021:033
And
if
a
man
shall
open
a
pit,
or
if
a
man
shall
dig
a
pit,
and
not
cover
it,
and
an
ox
or
an
ass
fall
therein;
021:034
The
owner
of
the
pit
shall
make
it
good,
and
give
money
unto
the
owner
of
them;
and
the
dead
beast
shall
be
his.
021:035
And
if
one
man's
ox
hurt
another's,
that
he
die;
then
they
shall
sell
the
live
ox,
and
divide
the
money
of
it;
and
the
dead
ox
also
they
shall
divide.
021:036
Or
if
it
be
known
that
the
ox
hath
used
to
push
in
time
past,
and
his
owner
hath
not
kept
him
in;
he
shall
surely
pay
ox
for
ox;
and
the
dead
shall
be
his
own.
022:001
If
a
man
shall
steal
an
ox,
or
a
sheep,
and
kill
it,
or
sell
it;
he
shall
restore
five
oxen
for
an
ox,
and
four
sheep
for
a
sheep.
022:002
If
a
thief
be
found
breaking
up,
and
be
smitten
that
he
die,
there
shall
no
blood
be
shed
for
him.
022:003
If
the
sun
be
risen
upon
him,
there
shall
be
blood
shed
for
him;
for
he
should
make
full
restitution;
if
he
have
nothing,
then
he
shall
be
sold
for
his
theft.
022:004
If
the
theft
be
certainly
found
in
his
hand
alive,
whether
it
be
ox,
or
ass,
or
sheep;
he
shall
restore
double.
022:005
If
a
man
shall
cause
a
field
or
vineyard
to
be
eaten,
and
shall
put
in
his
beast,
and
shall
feed
in
another
man's
field;
of
the
best
of
his
own
field,
and
of
the
best
of
his
own
vineyard,
shall
he
make
restitution.
022:006
If
fire
break
out,
and
catch
in
thorns,
so
that
the
stacks
of
corn,
or
the
standing
corn,
or
the
field,
be
consumed
therewith;
he
that
kindled
the
fire
shall
surely
make
restitution.
022:007
If
a
man
shall
deliver
unto
his
neighbour
money
or
stuff
to
keep,
and
it
be
stolen
out
of
the
man's
house;
if
the
thief
be
found,
let
him
pay
double.
022:008
If
the
thief
be
not
found,
then
the
master
of
the
house
shall
be
brought
unto
the
judges,
to
see
whether
he
have
put
his
hand
unto
his
neighbour's
goods.
022:009
For
all
manner
of
trespass,
whether
it
be
for
ox,
for
ass,
for
sheep,
for
raiment,
or
for
any
manner
of
lost
thing
which
another
challengeth
to
be
his,
the
cause
of
both
parties
shall
come
before
the
judges;
and
whom
the
judges
shall
condemn,
he
shall
pay
double
unto
his
neighbour.
022:010
If
a
man
deliver
unto
his
neighbour
an
ass,
or
an
ox,
or
a
sheep,
or
any
beast,
to
keep;
and
it
die,
or
be
hurt,
or
driven
away,
no
man
seeing
it:
022:011
Then
shall
an
oath
of
the
LORD
be
between
them
both,
that
he
hath
not
put
his
hand
unto
his
neighbour's
goods;
and
the
owner
of
it
shall
accept
thereof,
and
he
shall
not
make
it
good.
022:012
And
if
it
be
stolen
from
him,
he
shall
make
restitution
unto
the
owner
thereof.
022:013
If
it
be
torn
in
pieces,
then
let
him
bring
it
for
witness,
and
he
shall
not
make
good
that
which
was
torn.
022:014
And
if
a
man
borrow
ought
of
his
neighbour,
and
it
be
hurt,
or
die,
the
owner
thereof
being
not
with
it,
he
shall
surely
make
it
good.
022:015
But
if
the
owner
thereof
be
with
it,
he
shall
not
make
it
good:
if
it
be
an
hired
thing,
it
came
for
his
hire.
022:016
And
if
a
man
entice
a
maid
that
is
not
betrothed,
and
lie
with
her,
he
shall
surely
endow
her
to
be
his
wife.
022:017
If
her
father
utterly
refuse
to
give
her
unto
him,
he
shall
pay
money
according
to
the
dowry
of
virgins.
022:018
Thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live.
022:019
Whosoever
