evil
is
happened
unto
you,
as
at
this
day.
044:024
Moreover
Jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
people,
and
to
all
the
women,
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD,
all
Judah
that
are
in
the
land
of
Egypt:
044:025
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
saying;
Ye
and
your
wives
have
both
spoken
with
your
mouths,
and
fulfilled
with
your
hand,
saying,
We
will
surely
perform
our
vows
that
we
have
vowed,
to
burn
incense
to
the
queen
of
heaven,
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her:
ye
will
surely
accomplish
your
vows,
and
surely
perform
your
vows.
044:026
Therefore
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
LORD,
all
Judah
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
Egypt;
Behold,
I
have
sworn
by
my
great
name,
saith
the
LORD,
that
my
name
shall
no
more
be
named
in
the
mouth
of
any
man
of
Judah
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt,
saying,
The
Lord
GOD
liveth.
044:027
Behold,
I
will
watch
over
them
for
evil,
and
not
for
good:
and
all
the
men
of
Judah
that
are
in
the
land
of
Egypt
shall
be
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine,
until
there
be
an
end
of
them.
044:028
Yet
a
small
number
that
escape
the
sword
shall
return
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
into
the
land
of
Judah,
and
all
the
remnant
of
Judah,
that
are
gone
into
the
land
of
Egypt
to
sojourn
there,
shall
know
whose
words
shall
stand,
mine,
or
their's.
044:029
And
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
punish
you
in
this
place,
that
ye
may
know
that
my
words
shall
surely
stand
against
you
for
evil:
044:030
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
will
give
Pharaohhophra
king
of
Egypt
into
the
hand
of
his
enemies,
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
his
life;
as
I
gave
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon,
his
enemy,
and
that
sought
his
life.
045:001
The
word
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
unto
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah,
when
he
had
written
these
words
in
a
book
at
the
mouth
of
Jeremiah,
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah,
saying,
045:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel,
unto
thee,
O
Baruch:
045:003
Thou
didst
say,
Woe
is
me
now!
for
the
LORD
hath
added
grief
to
my
sorrow;
I
fainted
in
my
sighing,
and
I
find
no
rest.
045:004
Thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
him,
The
LORD
saith
thus;
Behold,
that
which
I
have
built
will
I
break
down,
and
that
which
I
have
planted
I
will
pluck
up,
even
this
whole
land.
045:005
And
seekest
thou
great
things
for
thyself?
seek
them
not:
for,
behold,
I
will
bring
evil
upon
all
flesh,
saith
the
LORD:
but
thy
life
will
I
give
unto
thee
for
a
prey
in
all
places
whither
thou
goest.
046:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
which
came
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
against
the
Gentiles;
046:002
Against
Egypt,
against
the
army
of
Pharaohnecho
king
of
Egypt,
which
was
by
the
river
Euphrates
in
Carchemish,
which
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
smote
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah.
046:003
Order
ye
the
buckler
and
shield,
and
draw
near
to
battle.
046:004
Harness
the
horses;
and
get
up,
ye
horsemen,
and
stand
forth
with
your
helmets;
furbish
the
spears,
and
put
on
the
brigandines.
046:005
Wherefore
have
I
seen
them
dismayed
and
turned
away
back?
and
their
mighty
ones
are
beaten
down,
and
are
fled
apace,
and
look
not
back:
for
fear
was
round
about,
saith
the
LORD.
046:006
Let
not
the
swift
flee
away,
nor
the
mighty
man
escape;
they
shall
stumble,
and
fall
toward
the
north
by
the
river
Euphrates.
046:007
Who
is
this
that
cometh
up
as
a
flood,
whose
waters
are
moved
as
the
rivers?
046:008
Egypt
riseth
up
like
a
flood,
and
his
waters
are
moved
like
the
rivers;
and
he
saith,
I
will
go
up,
and
will
cover
the
earth;
I
will
destroy
the
city
and
the
inhabitants
thereof.
046:009
Come
up,
ye
horses;
and
rage,
ye
chariots;
and
let
the
mighty
men
come
forth;
the
Ethiopians
and
the
Libyans,
that
handle
the
shield;
and
the
Lydians,
that
handle
and
bend
the
bow.
046:010
For
this
is
the
day
of
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts,
a
day
of
vengeance,
that
he
may
avenge
him
of
his
adversaries:
and
the
sword
shall
devour,
and
it
shall
be
satiate
and
made
drunk
with
their
blood:
for
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts
hath
a
sacrifice
in
the
north
country
by
the
river
Euphrates.
046:011
Go
up
into
Gilead,
and
take
balm,
O
virgin,
the
daughter
of
Egypt:
in
vain
shalt
thou
use
many
medicines;
for
thou
shalt
not
be
cured.
046:012
The
nations
have
heard
of
thy
shame,
and
thy
cry
hath
filled
the
land:
for
the
mighty
man
hath
stumbled
against
the
mighty,
and
they
are
fallen
both
together.
046:013
The
word
that
the
LORD
spake
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet,
how
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
should
come
and
smite
the
land
of
Egypt.
046:014
Declare
ye
in
Egypt,
and
publish
in
Migdol,
and
publish
in
Noph
and
in
Tahpanhes:
say
ye,
Stand
fast,
and
prepare
thee;
for
the
sword
shall
devour
round
about
thee.
046:015
Why
are
thy
valiant
men
swept
away?
they
stood
not,
because
the
LORD
did
drive
them.
046:016
He
made
many
to
fall,
yea,
one
fell
upon
another:
and
they
said,
Arise,
and
let
us
go
again
to
our
own
people,
and
to
the
land
of
our
nativity,
from
the
oppressing
sword.
046:017
They
did
cry
there,
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
is
but
a
noise;
he
hath
passed
the
time
appointed.
046:018
As
I
live,
saith
the
King,
whose
name
is
the
LORD
of
hosts,
Surely
as
Tabor
is
among
the
mountains,
and
as
Carmel
by
the
sea,
so
shall
he
come.
046:019
O
thou
daughter
dwelling
in
Egypt,
furnish
thyself
to
go
into
captivity:
for
Noph
shall
be
waste
and
desolate
without
an
inhabitant.
046:020
Egypt
is
like
a
very
fair
heifer,
but
destruction
cometh;
it
cometh
out
of
the
north.
046:021
Also
her
hired
men
are
in
the
midst
of
her
like
fatted
bullocks;
for
they
also
are
turned
back,
and
are
fled
away
together:
they
did
not
stand,
because
the
day
of
their
calamity
was
come
upon
them,
and
the
time
of
their
visitation.
046:022
The
voice
thereof
shall
go
like
a
serpent;
for
they
shall
march
with
an
army,
and
come
against
her
with
axes,
as
hewers
of
wood.
046:023
They
shall
cut
down
her
forest,
saith
the
LORD,
though
it
cannot
be
searched;
because
they
are
more
than
the
grasshoppers,
and
are
innumerable.
046:024
The
daughter
of
Egypt
shall
be
confounded;
she
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
people
of
the
north.
046:025
The
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
saith;
Behold,
I
will
punish
the
multitude
of
No,
and
Pharaoh,
and
Egypt,
with
their
gods,
and
their
kings;
even
Pharaoh,
and
all
them
that
trust
in
him:
046:026
And
I
will
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
those
that
seek
their
lives,
and
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon,
and
into
the
hand
of
his
servants:
and
afterward
it
shall
be
inhabited,
as
in
the
days
of
old,
saith
the
LORD.
046:027
But
fear
not
thou,
O
my
servant
Jacob,
and
be
not
dismayed,
O
Israel:
for,
behold,
I
will
save
thee
from
afar
off,
and
thy
seed
from
the
land
of
their
captivity;
and
Jacob
shall
return,
and
be
in
rest
and
at
ease,
and
none
shall
make
him
afraid.
046:028
Fear
thou
not,
O
Jacob
my
servant,
saith
the
LORD:
for
I
am
with
thee;
for
I
will
make
a
full
end
of
all
the
nations
whither
I
have
driven
thee:
but
I
will
not
make
a
full
end
of
thee,
but
correct
thee
in
measure;
yet
will
I
not
leave
thee
wholly
unpunished.
047:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
that
came
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
against
the
Philistines,
before
that
Pharaoh
smote
Gaza.
047:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
waters
rise
up
out
of
the
north,
and
shall
be
an
overflowing
flood,
and
shall
overflow
the
land,
and
all
that
is
therein;
the
city,
and
them
that
dwell
therein:
then
the
men
shall
cry,
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
shall
howl.
047:003
At
the
noise
of
the
stamping
of
the
hoofs
of
his
strong
horses,
at
the
rushing
of
his
chariots,
and
at
the
rumbling
of
his
wheels,
the
fathers
shall
not
look
back
to
their
children
for
feebleness
of
hands;
047:004
Because
of
the
day
that
cometh
to
spoil
all
the
Philistines,
and
to
cut
off
from
Tyrus
and
Zidon
every
helper
that
remaineth:
for
the
LORD
will
spoil
the
Philistines,
the
remnant
of
the
country
of
Caphtor.
047:005
Baldness
is
come
upon
Gaza;
Ashkelon
is
cut
off
with
the
remnant
of
their
valley:
how
long
wilt
thou
cut
thyself?
047:006
O
thou
sword
of
the
LORD,
how
long
will
it
be
ere
thou
be
quiet?
put
up
thyself
into
thy
scabbard,
rest,
and
be
still.
047:007
How
can
it
be
quiet,
seeing
the
LORD
hath
given
it
a
charge
against
Ashkelon,
and
against
the
sea
shore?
there
hath
he
appointed
it.
048:001
Against
Moab
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Woe
unto
Nebo!
for
it
is
spoiled:
Kiriathaim
is
confounded
and
taken:
Misgab
is
confounded
and
dismayed.
048:002
There
shall
be
no
more
praise
of
Moab:
in
Heshbon
they
have
devised
evil
against
it;
come,
and
let
us
cut
it
off
from
being
a
nation.
Also
thou
shalt
be
cut
down,
O
Madmen;
the
sword
shall
pursue
thee.
048:003
A
voice
of
crying
shall
be
from
Horonaim,
spoiling
and
great
destruction.
048:004
Moab
is
destroyed;
her
little
ones
have
caused
a
cry
to
be
heard.
048:005
For
in
the
going
up
of
Luhith
continual
weeping
shall
go
up;
for
in
the
going
down
of
Horonaim
the
enemies
have
heard
a
cry
of
destruction.
048:006
Flee,
save
your
lives,
and
be
like
the
heath
in
the
wilderness.
048:007
For
because
thou
hast
trusted
in
thy
works
and
in
thy
treasures,
thou
shalt
also
be
taken:
and
Chemosh
shall
go
forth
into
captivity
with
his
priests
and
his
princes
together.
048:008
And
the
spoiler
shall
come
upon
every
city,
and
no
city
shall
escape:
the
valley
also
shall
perish,
and
the
plain
shall
be
destroyed,
as
the
LORD
hath
spoken.
048:009
Give
wings
unto
Moab,
that
it
may
flee
and
get
away:
for
the
cities
thereof
shall
be
desolate,
without
any
to
dwell
therein.
048:010
Cursed
be
he
that
doeth
the
work
of
the
LORD
deceitfully,
and
cursed
be
he
that
keepeth
back
his
sword
from
blood.
048:011
Moab
hath
been
at
ease
from
his
youth,
and
he
hath
settled
on
his
lees,
and
hath
not
been
emptied
from
vessel
to
vessel,
neither
hath
he
gone
into
captivity:
therefore
his
taste
remained
in
him,
and
his
scent
is
not
changed.
048:012
Therefore,
behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
send
unto
him
wanderers,
that
shall
cause
him
to
wander,
and
shall
empty
his
vessels,
and
break
their
bottles.
048:013
And
Moab
shall
be
ashamed
of
Chemosh,
as
the
house
of
Israel
was
ashamed
of
Bethel
their
confidence.
048:014
How
say
ye,
We
are
mighty
and
strong
men
for
the
war?
048:015
Moab
is
spoiled,
and
gone
up
out
of
her
cities,
and
his
chosen
young
men
are
gone
down
to
the
slaughter,
saith
the
King,
whose
name
is
the
LORD
of
hosts.
048:016
The
calamity
of
Moab
is
near
to
come,
and
his
affliction
hasteth
fast.
048:017
All
ye
that
are
about
him,
bemoan
him;
and
all
ye
that
know
his
name,
say,
How
is
the
strong
staff
broken,
and
the
beautiful
rod!
048:018
Thou
daughter
that
dost
inhabit
Dibon,
come
down
from
thy
glory,
and
sit
in
thirst;
for
the
spoiler
of
Moab
shall
come
upon
thee,
and
he
shall
destroy
thy
strong
holds.
048:019
O
inhabitant
of
Aroer,
stand
by
the
way,
and
espy;
ask
him
that
fleeth,
and
her
that
escapeth,
and
say,
What
is
done?
048:020
Moab
is
confounded;
for
it
is
broken
down:
howl
and
cry;
tell
ye
it
in
Arnon,
that
Moab
is
spoiled,
048:021
And
judgment
is
come
upon
the
plain
country;
upon
Holon,
and
upon
Jahazah,
and
upon
Mephaath,
048:022
And
upon
Dibon,
and
upon
Nebo,
and
upon
Bethdiblathaim,
048:023
And
upon
Kiriathaim,
and
upon
Bethgamul,
and
upon
Bethmeon,
048:024
And
upon
Kerioth,
and
upon
Bozrah,
and
upon
all
the
cities
of
the
land
of
Moab,
far
or
near.
048:025
The
horn
of
Moab
is
cut
off,
and
his
arm
is
broken,
saith
the
LORD.
048:026
Make
ye
him
drunken:
for
he
magnified
himself
against
the
LORD:
Moab
also
shall
wallow
in
his
vomit,
and
he
also
shall
be
in
derision.
048:027
For
was
not
Israel
a
derision
unto
thee?
was
he
found
among
thieves?
for
since
thou
spakest
of
him,
thou
skippedst
for
joy.
048:028
O
ye
that
dwell
in
Moab,
leave
the
cities,
and
dwell
in
the
rock,
and
be
like
the
dove
that
maketh
her
nest
in
the
sides
of
the
hole's
mouth.
048:029
We
have
heard
the
pride
of
Moab,
(he
is
exceeding
proud)
his
loftiness,
and
his
arrogancy,
and
his
pride,
and
the
haughtiness
of
his
heart.
048:030
I
know
his
wrath,
saith
the
LORD;
but
it
shall
not
be
so;
his
lies
shall
not
so
effect
it.
048:031
Therefore
will
I
howl
for
Moab,
and
I
will
cry
out
for
all
Moab;
mine
heart
shall
mourn
for
the
men
of
Kirheres.
048:032
O
vine
of
Sibmah,
I
will
weep
for
thee
with
the
weeping
of
Jazer:
thy
plants
are
gone
over
the
sea,
they
reach
even
to
the
sea
of
Jazer:
the
spoiler
is
fallen
upon
thy
summer
fruits
and
upon
thy
vintage.
048:033
And
joy
and
gladness
is
taken
from
the
plentiful
field,
and
from
the
land
of
Moab,
and
I
have
caused
wine
to
fail
from
the
winepresses:
none
shall
tread
with
shouting;
their
shouting
shall
be
no
shouting.
048:034
From
the
cry
of
Heshbon
even
unto
Elealeh,
and
even
unto
Jahaz,
have
they
uttered
their
voice,
from
Zoar
even
unto
Horonaim,
as
an
heifer
of
three
years
old:
for
the
waters
also
of
Nimrim
shall
be
desolate.
048:035
Moreover
I
will
cause
to
cease
in
Moab,
saith
the
LORD,
him
that
offereth
in
the
high
places,
and
him
that
burneth
incense
to
his
gods.
048:036
Therefore
mine
heart
shall
sound
for
Moab
like
pipes,
and
mine
heart
shall
sound
like
pipes
for
the
men
of
Kirheres:
because
the
riches
that
he
hath
gotten
are
perished.
048:037
For
every
head
shall
be
bald,
and
every
beard
clipped:
upon
all
the
hands
shall
be
cuttings,
and
upon
the
loins
sackcloth.
048:038
There
shall
be
lamentation
generally
upon
all
the
housetops
of
Moab,
and
in
the
streets
thereof:
for
I
have
broken
Moab
like
a
vessel
wherein
is
no
pleasure,
saith
the
LORD.
048:039
They
shall
howl,
saying,
How
is
it
broken
down!
how
hath
Moab
turned
the
back
with
shame!
so
shall
Moab
be
a
derision
and
a
dismaying
to
all
them
about
him.
048:040
For
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
he
shall
fly
as
an
eagle,
and
shall
spread
his
wings
over
Moab.
048:041
Kerioth
is
taken,
and
the
strong
holds
are
surprised,
and
the
mighty
men's
hearts
in
Moab
at
that
day
shall
be
as
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
her
pangs.
048:042
And
Moab
shall
be
destroyed
from
being
a
people,
because
he
hath
magnified
himself
against
the
LORD.
048:043
Fear,
and
the
pit,
and
the
snare,
shall
be
upon
thee,
O
inhabitant
of
Moab,
saith
the
LORD.
048:044
He
that
fleeth
from
the
fear
shall
fall
into
the
pit;
and
he
that
getteth
up
out
of
the
pit
shall
be
taken
in
the
snare:
for
I
will
bring
upon
it,
even
upon
Moab,
the
year
of
their
visitation,
saith
the
LORD.
048:045
They
that
fled
stood
under
the
shadow
of
Heshbon
because
of
the
force:
but
a
fire
shall
come
forth
out
of
Heshbon,
and
a
flame
from
the
midst
of
Sihon,
and
shall
devour
the
corner
of
Moab,
and
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
tumultuous
ones.
048:046
Woe
be
unto
thee,
O
Moab!
the
people
of
Chemosh
perisheth:
for
thy
sons
are
taken
captives,
and
thy
daughters
captives.
048:047
Yet
will
I
bring
again
the
captivity
of
Moab
in
the
latter
days,
saith
the
LORD.
Thus
far
is
the
judgment
of
Moab.
049:001
Concerning
the
Ammonites,
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Hath
Israel
no
sons?
hath
he
no
heir?
why
then
doth
their
king
inherit
Gad,
and
his
people
dwell
in
his
cities?
049:002
Therefore,
behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
cause
an
alarm
of
war
to
be
heard
in
Rabbah
of
the
Ammonites;
and
it
shall
be
a
desolate
heap,
and
her
daughters
shall
be
burned
with
fire:
then
shall
Israel
be
heir
unto
them
that
were
his
heirs,
saith
the
LORD.
049:003
Howl,
O
Heshbon,
for
Ai
is
spoiled:
cry,
ye
daughters
of
Rabbah,
gird
you
with
sackcloth;
lament,
and
run
to
and
fro
by
the
hedges;
for
their
king
shall
go
into
captivity,
and
his
priests
and
his
princes
together.
049:004
Wherefore
gloriest
thou
in
the
valleys,
thy
flowing
valley,
O
backsliding
daughter?
that
trusted
in
her
treasures,
saying,
Who
shall
come
unto
me?
049:005
Behold,
I
will
bring
a
fear
upon
thee,
saith
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts,
from
all
those
that
be
about
thee;
and
ye
shall
be
driven
out
every
man
right
forth;
and
none
shall
gather
up
him
that
wandereth.
049:006
And
afterward
I
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
saith
the
LORD.
049:007
Concerning
Edom,
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Is
wisdom
no
more
in
Teman?
is
counsel
perished
from
the
prudent?
is
their
wisdom
vanished?
049:008
Flee
ye,
turn
back,
dwell
deep,
O
inhabitants
of
Dedan;
for
I
will
bring
the
calamity
of
Esau
upon
him,
the
time
that
I
will
visit
him.
049:009
If
grapegatherers
come
to
thee,
would
they
not
leave
some
gleaning
grapes?
if
thieves
by
night,
they
will
destroy
till
they
have
enough.
049:010
But
I
have
made
Esau
bare,
I
have
uncovered
his
secret
places,
and
he
shall
not
be
able
to
hide
himself:
his
seed
is
spoiled,
and
his
brethren,
and
his
neighbours,
and
he
is
not.
049:011
Leave
thy
fatherless
children,
I
will
preserve
them
alive;
and
let
thy
widows
trust
in
me.
049:012
For
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
they
whose
judgment
was
not
to
drink
of
the
cup
have
assuredly
drunken;
and
art
thou
he
that
shall
altogether
go
unpunished?
thou
shalt
not
go
unpunished,
but
thou
shalt
surely
drink
of
it.
049:013
For
I
have
sworn
by
myself,
saith
the
LORD,
that
Bozrah
shall
become
a
desolation,
a
reproach,
a
waste,
and
a
curse;
and
all
the
cities
thereof
shall
be
perpetual
wastes.
049:014
I
have
heard
a
rumour
from
the
LORD,
and
an
ambassador
is
sent
unto
the
heathen,
saying,
Gather
ye
together,
and
come
against
her,
and
rise
up
to
the
battle.
049:015
For,
lo,
I
will
make
thee
small
among
the
heathen,
and
despised
among
men.
049:016
Thy
terribleness
hath
deceived
thee,
and
the
pride
of
thine
heart,
O
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock,
that
holdest
the
height
of
the
hill:
though
thou
shouldest
make
thy
nest
as
high
as
the
eagle,
I
will
bring
thee
down
from
thence,
saith
the
LORD.
049:017
Also
Edom
shall
be
a
desolation:
every
one
that
goeth
by
it
shall
be
astonished,
and
shall
hiss
at
all
the
plagues
thereof.
049:018
As
in
the
overthrow
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
the
neighbour
cities
thereof,
saith
the
LORD,
no
man
shall
abide
there,
neither
shall
a
son
of
man
dwell
in
it.
049:019
Behold,
he
shall
come
up
like
a
lion
from
the
swelling
of
Jordan
against
the
habitation
of
the
strong:
but
I
will
suddenly
make
him
run
away
from
her:
and
who
is
a
chosen
man,
that
I
may
appoint
over
her?
for
who
is
like
me?
and
who
will
appoint
me
the
time?
and
who
is
that
shepherd
that
will
stand
before
me?
049:020
Therefore
hear
the
counsel
of
the
LORD,
that
he
hath
taken
against
Edom;
and
his
purposes,
that
he
hath
purposed
against
the
inhabitants
of
Teman:
Surely
the
least
of
the
flock
shall
draw
them
out:
surely
he
shall
make
their
habitations
desolate
with
them.
049:021
The
earth
is
moved
at
the
noise
of
their
fall,
at
the
cry
the
noise
thereof
was
heard
in
the
Red
sea.
049:022
Behold,
he
shall
come
up
and
fly
as
the
eagle,
and
spread
his
wings
over
Bozrah:
and
at
that
day
shall
the
heart
of
the
mighty
men
of
Edom
be
as
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
her
pangs.
049:023
Concerning
Damascus.
Hamath
is
confounded,
and
Arpad:
for
they
have
heard
evil
tidings:
they
are
fainthearted;
there
is
sorrow
on
the
sea;
it
cannot
be
quiet.
049:024
Damascus
is
waxed
feeble,
and
turneth
herself
to
flee,
and
fear
hath
seized
on
her:
anguish
and
sorrows
have
taken
her,
as
a
woman
in
travail.
049:025
How
is
the
city
of
praise
not
left,
the
city
of
my
joy!
049:026
Therefore
her
young
men
shall
fall
in
her
streets,
and
all
the
men
of
war
shall
be
cut
off
in
that
day,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
049:027
And
I
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
wall
of
Damascus,
and
it
shall
consume
the
palaces
of
Benhadad.
049:028
Concerning
Kedar,
and
concerning
the
kingdoms
of
Hazor,
which
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
shall
smite,
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Arise
ye,
go
up
to
Kedar,
and
spoil
the
men
of
the
east.
049:029
Their
tents
and
their
flocks
shall
they
take
away:
they
shall
take
to
themselves
their
curtains,
and
all
their
vessels,
and
their
camels;
and
they
shall
cry
unto
them,
Fear
is
on
every
side.
049:030
Flee,
get
you
far
off,
dwell
deep,
O
ye
inhabitants
of
Hazor,
saith
the
LORD;
for
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
hath
taken
counsel
against
you,
and
hath
conceived
a
purpose
against
you.
049:031
Arise,
get
you
up
unto
the
wealthy
nation,
that
dwelleth
without
care,
saith
the
LORD,
which
have
neither
gates
nor
bars,
which
dwell
alone.
049:032
And
their
camels
shall
be
a
booty,
and
the
multitude
of
their
cattle
a
spoil:
and
I
will
scatter
into
all
winds
them
that
are
in
the
utmost
corners;
and
I
will
bring
their
calamity
from
all
sides
thereof,
saith
the
LORD.
049:033
And
Hazor
shall
be
a
dwelling
for
dragons,
and
a
desolation
for
ever:
there
shall
no
man
abide
there,
nor
any
son
of
man
dwell
in
it.
049:034
The
word
of
the
LORD
that
came
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
against
Elam
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah,
saying,
049:035
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Behold,
I
will
break
the
bow
of
Elam,
the
chief
of
their
might.
049:036
And
upon
Elam
will
I
bring
the
four
winds
from
the
four
quarters
of
heaven,
and
will
scatter
them
toward
all
those
winds;
and
there
shall
be
no
nation
whither
the
outcasts
of
Elam
shall
not
come.
049:037
For
I
will
cause
Elam
to
be
dismayed
before
their
enemies,
and
before
them
that
seek
their
life:
and
I
will
bring
evil
upon
them,
even
my
fierce
anger,
saith
the
LORD;
and
I
will
send
the
sword
after
them,
till
I
have
consumed
them:
049:038
And
I
will
set
my
throne
in
Elam,
and
will
destroy
from
thence
the
king
and
the
princes,
saith
the
LORD.
049:039
But
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
latter
days,
that
I
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
Elam,
saith
the
LORD.
050:001
The
word
that
the
LORD
spake
against
Babylon
and
against
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
by
Jeremiah
the
prophet.
050:002
Declare
ye
among
the
nations,
and
publish,
and
set
up
a
standard;
publish,
and
conceal
not:
say,
Babylon
is
taken,
Bel
is
confounded,
Merodach
is
broken
in
pieces;
her
idols
are
confounded,
her
images
are
broken
in
pieces.
050:003
For
out
of
the
north
there
cometh
up
a
nation
against
her,
which
shall
make
her
land
desolate,
and
none
shall
dwell
therein:
they
shall
remove,
they
shall
depart,
both
man
and
beast.
050:004
In
those
