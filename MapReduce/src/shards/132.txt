days,
and
in
that
time,
saith
the
LORD,
the
children
of
Israel
shall
come,
they
and
the
children
of
Judah
together,
going
and
weeping:
they
shall
go,
and
seek
the
LORD
their
God.
050:005
They
shall
ask
the
way
to
Zion
with
their
faces
thitherward,
saying,
Come,
and
let
us
join
ourselves
to
the
LORD
in
a
perpetual
covenant
that
shall
not
be
forgotten.
050:006
My
people
hath
been
lost
sheep:
their
shepherds
have
caused
them
to
go
astray,
they
have
turned
them
away
on
the
mountains:
they
have
gone
from
mountain
to
hill,
they
have
forgotten
their
restingplace.
050:007
All
that
found
them
have
devoured
them:
and
their
adversaries
said,
We
offend
not,
because
they
have
sinned
against
the
LORD,
the
habitation
of
justice,
even
the
LORD,
the
hope
of
their
fathers.
050:008
Remove
out
of
the
midst
of
Babylon,
and
go
forth
out
of
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
be
as
the
he
goats
before
the
flocks.
050:009
For,
lo,
I
will
raise
and
cause
to
come
up
against
Babylon
an
assembly
of
great
nations
from
the
north
country:
and
they
shall
set
themselves
in
array
against
her;
from
thence
she
shall
be
taken:
their
arrows
shall
be
as
of
a
mighty
expert
man;
none
shall
return
in
vain.
050:010
And
Chaldea
shall
be
a
spoil:
all
that
spoil
her
shall
be
satisfied,
saith
the
LORD.
050:011
Because
ye
were
glad,
because
ye
rejoiced,
O
ye
destroyers
of
mine
heritage,
because
ye
are
grown
fat
as
the
heifer
at
grass,
and
bellow
as
bulls;
050:012
Your
mother
shall
be
sore
confounded;
she
that
bare
you
shall
be
ashamed:
behold,
the
hindermost
of
the
nations
shall
be
a
wilderness,
a
dry
land,
and
a
desert.
050:013
Because
of
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
it
shall
not
be
inhabited,
but
it
shall
be
wholly
desolate:
every
one
that
goeth
by
Babylon
shall
be
astonished,
and
hiss
at
all
her
plagues.
050:014
Put
yourselves
in
array
against
Babylon
round
about:
all
ye
that
bend
the
bow,
shoot
at
her,
spare
no
arrows:
for
she
hath
sinned
against
the
LORD.
050:015
Shout
against
her
round
about:
she
hath
given
her
hand:
her
foundations
are
fallen,
her
walls
are
thrown
down:
for
it
is
the
vengeance
of
the
LORD:
take
vengeance
upon
her;
as
she
hath
done,
do
unto
her.
050:016
Cut
off
the
sower
from
Babylon,
and
him
that
handleth
the
sickle
in
the
time
of
harvest:
for
fear
of
the
oppressing
sword
they
shall
turn
every
one
to
his
people,
and
they
shall
flee
every
one
to
his
own
land.
050:017
Israel
is
a
scattered
sheep;
the
lions
have
driven
him
away:
first
the
king
of
Assyria
hath
devoured
him;
and
last
this
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
hath
broken
his
bones.
050:018
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
Behold,
I
will
punish
the
king
of
Babylon
and
his
land,
as
I
have
punished
the
king
of
Assyria.
050:019
And
I
will
bring
Israel
again
to
his
habitation,
and
he
shall
feed
on
Carmel
and
Bashan,
and
his
soul
shall
be
satisfied
upon
mount
Ephraim
and
Gilead.
050:020
In
those
days,
and
in
that
time,
saith
the
LORD,
the
iniquity
of
Israel
shall
be
sought
for,
and
there
shall
be
none;
and
the
sins
of
Judah,
and
they
shall
not
be
found:
for
I
will
pardon
them
whom
I
reserve.
050:021
Go
up
against
the
land
of
Merathaim,
even
against
it,
and
against
the
inhabitants
of
Pekod:
waste
and
utterly
destroy
after
them,
saith
the
LORD,
and
do
according
to
all
that
I
have
commanded
thee.
050:022
A
sound
of
battle
is
in
the
land,
and
of
great
destruction.
050:023
How
is
the
hammer
of
the
whole
earth
cut
asunder
and
broken!
how
is
Babylon
become
a
desolation
among
the
nations!
050:024
I
have
laid
a
snare
for
thee,
and
thou
art
also
taken,
O
Babylon,
and
thou
wast
not
aware:
thou
art
found,
and
also
caught,
because
thou
hast
striven
against
the
LORD.
050:025
The
LORD
hath
opened
his
armoury,
and
hath
brought
forth
the
weapons
of
his
indignation:
for
this
is
the
work
of
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts
in
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans.
050:026
Come
against
her
from
the
utmost
border,
open
her
storehouses:
cast
her
up
as
heaps,
and
destroy
her
utterly:
let
nothing
of
her
be
left.
050:027
Slay
all
her
bullocks;
let
them
go
down
to
the
slaughter:
woe
unto
them!
for
their
day
is
come,
the
time
of
their
visitation.
050:028
The
voice
of
them
that
flee
and
escape
out
of
the
land
of
Babylon,
to
declare
in
Zion
the
vengeance
of
the
LORD
our
God,
the
vengeance
of
his
temple.
050:029
Call
together
the
archers
against
Babylon:
all
ye
that
bend
the
bow,
camp
against
it
round
about;
let
none
thereof
escape:
recompense
her
according
to
her
work;
according
to
all
that
she
hath
done,
do
unto
her:
for
she
hath
been
proud
against
the
LORD,
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
050:030
Therefore
shall
her
young
men
fall
in
the
streets,
and
all
her
men
of
war
shall
be
cut
off
in
that
day,
saith
the
LORD.
050:031
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
O
thou
most
proud,
saith
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts:
for
thy
day
is
come,
the
time
that
I
will
visit
thee.
050:032
And
the
most
proud
shall
stumble
and
fall,
and
none
shall
raise
him
up:
and
I
will
kindle
a
fire
in
his
cities,
and
it
shall
devour
all
round
about
him.
050:033
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
The
children
of
Israel
and
the
children
of
Judah
were
oppressed
together:
and
all
that
took
them
captives
held
them
fast;
they
refused
to
let
them
go.
050:034
Their
Redeemer
is
strong;
the
LORD
of
hosts
is
his
name:
he
shall
throughly
plead
their
cause,
that
he
may
give
rest
to
the
land,
and
disquiet
the
inhabitants
of
Babylon.
050:035
A
sword
is
upon
the
Chaldeans,
saith
the
LORD,
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
Babylon,
and
upon
her
princes,
and
upon
her
wise
men.
050:036
A
sword
is
upon
the
liars;
and
they
shall
dote:
a
sword
is
upon
her
mighty
men;
and
they
shall
be
dismayed.
050:037
A
sword
is
upon
their
horses,
and
upon
their
chariots,
and
upon
all
the
mingled
people
that
are
in
the
midst
of
her;
and
they
shall
become
as
women:
a
sword
is
upon
her
treasures;
and
they
shall
be
robbed.
050:038
A
drought
is
upon
her
waters;
and
they
shall
be
dried
up:
for
it
is
the
land
of
graven
images,
and
they
are
mad
upon
their
idols.
050:039
Therefore
the
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
with
the
wild
beasts
of
the
islands
shall
dwell
there,
and
the
owls
shall
dwell
therein:
and
it
shall
be
no
more
inhabited
for
ever;
neither
shall
it
be
dwelt
in
from
generation
to
generation.
050:040
As
God
overthrew
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
the
neighbour
cities
thereof,
saith
the
LORD;
so
shall
no
man
abide
there,
neither
shall
any
son
of
man
dwell
therein.
050:041
Behold,
a
people
shall
come
from
the
north,
and
a
great
nation,
and
many
kings
shall
be
raised
up
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth.
050:042
They
shall
hold
the
bow
and
the
lance:
they
are
cruel,
and
will
not
shew
mercy:
their
voice
shall
roar
like
the
sea,
and
they
shall
ride
upon
horses,
every
one
put
in
array,
like
a
man
to
the
battle,
against
thee,
O
daughter
of
Babylon.
050:043
The
king
of
Babylon
hath
heard
the
report
of
them,
and
his
hands
waxed
feeble:
anguish
took
hold
of
him,
and
pangs
as
of
a
woman
in
travail.
050:044
Behold,
he
shall
come
up
like
a
lion
from
the
swelling
of
Jordan
unto
the
habitation
of
the
strong:
but
I
will
make
them
suddenly
run
away
from
her:
and
who
is
a
chosen
man,
that
I
may
appoint
over
her?
for
who
is
like
me?
and
who
will
appoint
me
the
time?
and
who
is
that
shepherd
that
will
stand
before
me?
050:045
Therefore
hear
ye
the
counsel
of
the
LORD,
that
he
hath
taken
against
Babylon;
and
his
purposes,
that
he
hath
purposed
against
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans:
Surely
the
least
of
the
flock
shall
draw
them
out:
surely
he
shall
make
their
habitation
desolate
with
them.
050:046
At
the
noise
of
the
taking
of
Babylon
the
earth
is
moved,
and
the
cry
is
heard
among
the
nations.
051:001
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
will
raise
up
against
Babylon,
and
against
them
that
dwell
in
the
midst
of
them
that
rise
up
against
me,
a
destroying
wind;
051:002
And
will
send
unto
Babylon
fanners,
that
shall
fan
her,
and
shall
empty
her
land:
for
in
the
day
of
trouble
they
shall
be
against
her
round
about.
051:003
Against
him
that
bendeth
let
the
archer
bend
his
bow,
and
against
him
that
lifteth
himself
up
in
his
brigandine:
and
spare
ye
not
her
young
men;
destroy
ye
utterly
all
her
host.
051:004
Thus
the
slain
shall
fall
in
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
they
that
are
thrust
through
in
her
streets.
051:005
For
Israel
hath
not
been
forsaken,
nor
Judah
of
his
God,
of
the
LORD
of
hosts;
though
their
land
was
filled
with
sin
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
051:006
Flee
out
of
the
midst
of
Babylon,
and
deliver
every
man
his
soul:
be
not
cut
off
in
her
iniquity;
for
this
is
the
time
of
the
LORD's
vengeance;
he
will
render
unto
her
a
recompence.
051:007
Babylon
hath
been
a
golden
cup
in
the
LORD's
hand,
that
made
all
the
earth
drunken:
the
nations
have
drunken
of
her
wine;
therefore
the
nations
are
mad.
051:008
Babylon
is
suddenly
fallen
and
destroyed:
howl
for
her;
take
balm
for
her
pain,
if
so
be
she
may
be
healed.
051:009
We
would
have
healed
Babylon,
but
she
is
not
healed:
forsake
her,
and
let
us
go
every
one
into
his
own
country:
for
her
judgment
reacheth
unto
heaven,
and
is
lifted
up
even
to
the
skies.
051:010
The
LORD
hath
brought
forth
our
righteousness:
come,
and
let
us
declare
in
Zion
the
work
of
the
LORD
our
God.
051:011
Make
bright
the
arrows;
gather
the
shields:
the
LORD
hath
raised
up
the
spirit
of
the
kings
of
the
Medes:
for
his
device
is
against
Babylon,
to
destroy
it;
because
it
is
the
vengeance
of
the
LORD,
the
vengeance
of
his
temple.
051:012
Set
up
the
standard
upon
the
walls
of
Babylon,
make
the
watch
strong,
set
up
the
watchmen,
prepare
the
ambushes:
for
the
LORD
hath
both
devised
and
done
that
which
he
spake
against
the
inhabitants
of
Babylon.
051:013
O
thou
that
dwellest
upon
many
waters,
abundant
in
treasures,
thine
end
is
come,
and
the
measure
of
thy
covetousness.
051:014
The
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sworn
by
himself,
saying,
Surely
I
will
fill
thee
with
men,
as
with
caterpillers;
and
they
shall
lift
up
a
shout
against
thee.
051:015
He
hath
made
the
earth
by
his
power,
he
hath
established
the
world
by
his
wisdom,
and
hath
stretched
out
the
heaven
by
his
understanding.
051:016
When
he
uttereth
his
voice,
there
is
a
multitude
of
waters
in
the
heavens;
and
he
causeth
the
vapours
to
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth:
he
maketh
lightnings
with
rain,
and
bringeth
forth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasures.
051:017
Every
man
is
brutish
by
his
knowledge;
every
founder
is
confounded
by
the
graven
image:
for
his
molten
image
is
falsehood,
and
there
is
no
breath
in
them.
051:018
They
are
vanity,
the
work
of
errors:
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they
shall
perish.
051:019
The
portion
of
Jacob
is
not
like
them;
for
he
is
the
former
of
all
things:
and
Israel
is
the
rod
of
his
inheritance:
the
LORD
of
hosts
is
his
name.
051:020
Thou
art
my
battle
axe
and
weapons
of
war:
for
with
thee
will
I
break
in
pieces
the
nations,
and
with
thee
will
I
destroy
kingdoms;
051:021
And
with
thee
will
I
break
in
pieces
the
horse
and
his
rider;
and
with
thee
will
I
break
in
pieces
the
chariot
and
his
rider;
051:022
With
thee
also
will
I
break
in
pieces
man
and
woman;
and
with
thee
will
I
break
in
pieces
old
and
young;
and
with
thee
will
I
break
in
pieces
the
young
man
and
the
maid;
051:023
I
will
also
break
in
pieces
with
thee
the
shepherd
and
his
flock;
and
with
thee
will
I
break
in
pieces
the
husbandman
and
his
yoke
of
oxen;
and
with
thee
will
I
break
in
pieces
captains
and
rulers.
051:024
And
I
will
render
unto
Babylon
and
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
Chaldea
all
their
evil
that
they
have
done
in
Zion
in
your
sight,
saith
the
LORD.
051:025
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
O
destroying
mountain,
saith
the
LORD,
which
destroyest
all
the
earth:
and
I
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
thee,
and
roll
thee
down
from
the
rocks,
and
will
make
thee
a
burnt
mountain.
051:026
And
they
shall
not
take
of
thee
a
stone
for
a
corner,
nor
a
stone
for
foundations;
but
thou
shalt
be
desolate
for
ever,
saith
the
LORD.
051:027
Set
ye
up
a
standard
in
the
land,
blow
the
trumpet
among
the
nations,
prepare
the
nations
against
her,
call
together
against
her
the
kingdoms
of
Ararat,
Minni,
and
Ashchenaz;
appoint
a
captain
against
her;
cause
the
horses
to
come
up
as
the
rough
caterpillers.
051:028
Prepare
against
her
the
nations
with
the
kings
of
the
Medes,
the
captains
thereof,
and
all
the
rulers
thereof,
and
all
the
land
of
his
dominion.
051:029
And
the
land
shall
tremble
and
sorrow:
for
every
purpose
of
the
LORD
shall
be
performed
against
Babylon,
to
make
the
land
of
Babylon
a
desolation
without
an
inhabitant.
051:030
The
mighty
men
of
Babylon
have
forborn
to
fight,
they
have
remained
in
their
holds:
their
might
hath
failed;
they
became
as
women:
they
have
burned
her
dwellingplaces;
her
bars
are
broken.
051:031
One
post
shall
run
to
meet
another,
and
one
messenger
to
meet
another,
to
shew
the
king
of
Babylon
that
his
city
is
taken
at
one
end,
051:032
And
that
the
passages
are
stopped,
and
the
reeds
they
have
burned
with
fire,
and
the
men
of
war
are
affrighted.
051:033
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel;
The
daughter
of
Babylon
is
like
a
threshingfloor,
it
is
time
to
thresh
her:
yet
a
little
while,
and
the
time
of
her
harvest
shall
come.
051:034
Nebuchadrezzar
the
king
of
Babylon
hath
devoured
me,
he
hath
crushed
me,
he
hath
made
me
an
empty
vessel,
he
hath
swallowed
me
up
like
a
dragon,
he
hath
filled
his
belly
with
my
delicates,
he
hath
cast
me
out.
051:035
The
violence
done
to
me
and
to
my
flesh
be
upon
Babylon,
shall
the
inhabitant
of
Zion
say;
and
my
blood
upon
the
inhabitants
of
Chaldea,
shall
Jerusalem
say.
051:036
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
will
plead
thy
cause,
and
take
vengeance
for
thee;
and
I
will
dry
up
her
sea,
and
make
her
springs
dry.
051:037
And
Babylon
shall
become
heaps,
a
dwellingplace
for
dragons,
an
astonishment,
and
an
hissing,
without
an
inhabitant.
051:038
They
shall
roar
together
like
lions:
they
shall
yell
as
lions'
whelps.
051:039
In
their
heat
I
will
make
their
feasts,
and
I
will
make
them
drunken,
that
they
may
rejoice,
and
sleep
a
perpetual
sleep,
and
not
wake,
saith
the
LORD.
051:040
I
will
bring
them
down
like
lambs
to
the
slaughter,
like
rams
with
he
goats.
051:041
How
is
Sheshach
taken!
and
how
is
the
praise
of
the
whole
earth
surprised!
how
is
Babylon
become
an
astonishment
among
the
nations!
051:042
The
sea
is
come
up
upon
Babylon:
she
is
covered
with
the
multitude
of
the
waves
thereof.
051:043
Her
cities
are
a
desolation,
a
dry
land,
and
a
wilderness,
a
land
wherein
no
man
dwelleth,
neither
doth
any
son
of
man
pass
thereby.
051:044
And
I
will
punish
Bel
in
Babylon,
and
I
will
bring
forth
out
of
his
mouth
that
which
he
hath
swallowed
up:
and
the
nations
shall
not
flow
together
any
more
unto
him:
yea,
the
wall
of
Babylon
shall
fall.
051:045
My
people,
go
ye
out
of
the
midst
of
her,
and
deliver
ye
every
man
his
soul
from
the
fierce
anger
of
the
LORD.
051:046
And
lest
your
heart
faint,
and
ye
fear
for
the
rumour
that
shall
be
heard
in
the
land;
a
rumour
shall
both
come
one
year,
and
after
that
in
another
year
shall
come
a
rumour,
and
violence
in
the
land,
ruler
against
ruler.
051:047
Therefore,
behold,
the
days
come,
that
I
will
do
judgment
upon
the
graven
images
of
Babylon:
and
her
whole
land
shall
be
confounded,
and
all
her
slain
shall
fall
in
the
midst
of
her.
051:048
Then
the
heaven
and
the
earth,
and
all
that
is
therein,
shall
sing
for
Babylon:
for
the
spoilers
shall
come
unto
her
from
the
north,
saith
the
LORD.
051:049
As
Babylon
hath
caused
the
slain
of
Israel
to
fall,
so
at
Babylon
shall
fall
the
slain
of
all
the
earth.
051:050
Ye
that
have
escaped
the
sword,
go
away,
stand
not
still:
remember
the
LORD
afar
off,
and
let
Jerusalem
come
into
your
mind.
051:051
We
are
confounded,
because
we
have
heard
reproach:
shame
hath
covered
our
faces:
for
strangers
are
come
into
the
sanctuaries
of
the
LORD's
house.
051:052
Wherefore,
behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
I
will
do
judgment
upon
her
graven
images:
and
through
all
her
land
the
wounded
shall
groan.
051:053
Though
Babylon
should
mount
up
to
heaven,
and
though
she
should
fortify
the
height
of
her
strength,
yet
from
me
shall
spoilers
come
unto
her,
saith
the
LORD.
051:054
A
sound
of
a
cry
cometh
from
Babylon,
and
great
destruction
from
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans:
051:055
Because
the
LORD
hath
spoiled
Babylon,
and
destroyed
out
of
her
the
great
voice;
when
her
waves
do
roar
like
great
waters,
a
noise
of
their
voice
is
uttered:
051:056
Because
the
spoiler
is
come
upon
her,
even
upon
Babylon,
and
her
mighty
men
are
taken,
every
one
of
their
bows
is
broken:
for
the
LORD
God
of
recompences
shall
surely
requite.
051:057
And
I
will
make
drunk
her
princes,
and
her
wise
men,
her
captains,
and
her
rulers,
and
her
mighty
men:
and
they
shall
sleep
a
perpetual
sleep,
and
not
wake,
saith
the
King,
whose
name
is
the
LORD
of
hosts.
051:058
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
The
broad
walls
of
Babylon
shall
be
utterly
broken,
and
her
high
gates
shall
be
burned
with
fire;
and
the
people
shall
labour
in
vain,
and
the
folk
in
the
fire,
and
they
shall
be
weary.
051:059
The
word
which
Jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
Seraiah
the
son
of
Neriah,
the
son
of
Maaseiah,
when
he
went
with
Zedekiah
the
king
of
Judah
into
Babylon
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
reign.
And
this
Seraiah
was
a
quiet
prince.
051:060
So
Jeremiah
wrote
in
a
book
all
the
evil
that
should
come
upon
Babylon,
even
all
these
words
that
are
written
against
Babylon.
051:061
And
Jeremiah
said
to
Seraiah,
When
thou
comest
to
Babylon,
and
shalt
see,
and
shalt
read
all
these
words;
051:062
Then
shalt
thou
say,
O
LORD,
thou
hast
spoken
against
this
place,
to
cut
it
off,
that
none
shall
remain
in
it,
neither
man
nor
beast,
but
that
it
shall
be
desolate
for
ever.
051:063
And
it
shall
be,
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
reading
this
book,
that
thou
shalt
bind
a
stone
to
it,
and
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
Euphrates:
051:064
And
thou
shalt
say,
Thus
shall
Babylon
sink,
and
shall
not
rise
from
the
evil
that
I
will
bring
upon
her:
and
they
shall
be
weary.
Thus
far
are
the
words
of
Jeremiah.
052:001
Zedekiah
was
one
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
eleven
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Hamutal
the
daughter
of
Jeremiah
of
Libnah.
052:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
Jehoiakim
had
done.
052:003
For
through
the
anger
of
the
LORD
it
came
to
pass
in
Jerusalem
and
Judah,
till
he
had
cast
them
out
from
his
presence,
that
Zedekiah
rebelled
against
the
king
of
Babylon.
052:004
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
ninth
year
of
his
reign,
in
the
tenth
month,
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month,
that
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
came,
he
and
all
his
army,
against
Jerusalem,
and
pitched
against
it,
and
built
forts
against
it
round
about.
052:005
So
the
city
was
besieged
unto
the
eleventh
year
of
king
Zedekiah.
052:006
And
in
the
fourth
month,
in
the
ninth
day
of
the
month,
the
famine
was
sore
in
the
city,
so
that
there
was
no
bread
for
the
people
of
the
land.
052:007
Then
the
city
was
broken
up,
and
all
the
men
of
war
fled,
and
went
forth
out
of
the
city
by
night
by
the
way
of
the
gate
between
the
two
walls,
which
was
by
the
king's
garden;
(now
the
Chaldeans
were
by
the
city
round
about:)
and
they
went
by
the
way
of
the
plain.
052:008
But
the
army
of
the
Chaldeans
pursued
after
the
king,
and
overtook
Zedekiah
in
the
plains
of
Jericho;
and
all
his
army
was
scattered
from
him.
052:009
Then
they
took
the
king,
and
carried
him
up
unto
the
king
of
Babylon
to
Riblah
in
the
land
of
Hamath;
where
he
gave
judgment
upon
him.
052:010
And
the
king
of
Babylon
slew
the
sons
of
Zedekiah
before
his
eyes:
he
slew
also
all
the
princes
of
Judah
in
Riblah.
052:011
Then
he
put
out
the
eyes
of
Zedekiah;
and
the
king
of
Babylon
bound
him
in
chains,
and
carried
him
to
Babylon,
and
put
him
in
prison
till
the
day
of
his
death.
052:012
Now
in
the
fifth
month,
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month,
which
was
the
nineteenth
year
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon,
came
Nebuzaradan,
captain
of
the
guard,
which
served
the
king
of
Babylon,
into
Jerusalem,
052:013
And
burned
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
king's
house;
and
all
the
houses
of
Jerusalem,
and
all
the
houses
of
the
great
men,
burned
he
with
fire:
052:014
And
all
the
army
of
the
Chaldeans,
that
were
with
the
captain
of
the
guard,
brake
down
all
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
round
about.
052:015
Then
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
carried
away
captive
certain
of
the
poor
of
the
people,
and
the
residue
of
the
people
that
remained
in
the
city,
and
those
that
fell
away,
that
fell
to
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
the
rest
of
the
multitude.
052:016
But
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
left
certain
of
the
poor
of
the
land
for
vinedressers
and
for
husbandmen.
052:017
Also
the
pillars
of
brass
that
were
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
bases,
and
the
brasen
sea
that
was
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
the
Chaldeans
brake,
and
carried
all
the
brass
of
them
to
Babylon.
052:018
The
caldrons
also,
and
the
shovels,
and
the
snuffers,
and
the
bowls,
and
the
spoons,
and
all
the
vessels
of
brass
wherewith
they
ministered,
took
they
away.
052:019
And
the
basons,
and
the
firepans,
and
the
bowls,
and
the
caldrons,
and
the
candlesticks,
and
the
spoons,
and
the
cups;
that
which
was
of
gold
in
gold,
and
that
which
was
of
silver
in
silver,
took
the
captain
of
the
guard
away.
052:020
The
two
pillars,
one
sea,
and
twelve
brasen
bulls
that
were
under
the
bases,
which
king
Solomon
had
made
in
the
house
of
the
LORD:
the
brass
of
all
these
vessels
was
without
weight.
052:021
And
concerning
the
pillars,
the
height
of
one
pillar
was
eighteen
cubits;
and
a
fillet
of
twelve
cubits
did
compass
it;
and
the
thickness
thereof
was
four
fingers:
it
was
hollow.
052:022
And
a
chapiter
of
brass
was
upon
it;
and
the
height
of
one
chapiter
was
five
cubits,
with
network
and
pomegranates
upon
the
chapiters
round
about,
all
of
brass.
The
second
pillar
also
and
the
pomegranates
were
like
unto
these.
052:023
And
there
were
ninety
and
six
pomegranates
on
a
side;
and
all
the
pomegranates
upon
the
network
were
an
hundred
round
about.
052:024
And
the
captain
of
the
guard
took
Seraiah
the
chief
priest,
and
Zephaniah
the
second
