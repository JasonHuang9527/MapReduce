the
sole
of
their
feet
was
like
the
sole
of
a
calf's
foot:
and
they
sparkled
like
the
colour
of
burnished
brass.
001:008
And
they
had
the
hands
of
a
man
under
their
wings
on
their
four
sides;
and
they
four
had
their
faces
and
their
wings.
001:009
Their
wings
were
joined
one
to
another;
they
turned
not
when
they
went;
they
went
every
one
straight
forward.
001:010
As
for
the
likeness
of
their
faces,
they
four
had
the
face
of
a
man,
and
the
face
of
a
lion,
on
the
right
side:
and
they
four
had
the
face
of
an
ox
on
the
left
side;
they
four
also
had
the
face
of
an
eagle.
001:011
Thus
were
their
faces:
and
their
wings
were
stretched
upward;
two
wings
of
every
one
were
joined
one
to
another,
and
two
covered
their
bodies.
001:012
And
they
went
every
one
straight
forward:
whither
the
spirit
was
to
go,
they
went;
and
they
turned
not
when
they
went.
001:013
As
for
the
likeness
of
the
living
creatures,
their
appearance
was
like
burning
coals
of
fire,
and
like
the
appearance
of
lamps:
it
went
up
and
down
among
the
living
creatures;
and
the
fire
was
bright,
and
out
of
the
fire
went
forth
lightning.
001:014
And
the
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
as
the
appearance
of
a
flash
of
lightning.
001:015
Now
as
I
beheld
the
living
creatures,
behold
one
wheel
upon
the
earth
by
the
living
creatures,
with
his
four
faces.
001:016
The
appearance
of
the
wheels
and
their
work
was
like
unto
the
colour
of
a
beryl:
and
they
four
had
one
likeness:
and
their
appearance
and
their
work
was
as
it
were
a
wheel
in
the
middle
of
a
wheel.
001:017
When
they
went,
they
went
upon
their
four
sides:
and
they
turned
not
when
they
went.
001:018
As
for
their
rings,
they
were
so
high
that
they
were
dreadful;
and
their
rings
were
full
of
eyes
round
about
them
four.
001:019
And
when
the
living
creatures
went,
the
wheels
went
by
them:
and
when
the
living
creatures
were
lifted
up
from
the
earth,
the
wheels
were
lifted
up.
001:020
Whithersoever
the
spirit
was
to
go,
they
went,
thither
was
their
spirit
to
go;
and
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
over
against
them:
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
the
wheels.
001:021
When
those
went,
these
went;
and
when
those
stood,
these
stood;
and
when
those
were
lifted
up
from
the
earth,
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
over
against
them:
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
the
wheels.
001:022
And
the
likeness
of
the
firmament
upon
the
heads
of
the
living
creature
was
as
the
colour
of
the
terrible
crystal,
stretched
forth
over
their
heads
above.
001:023
And
under
the
firmament
were
their
wings
straight,
the
one
toward
the
other:
every
one
had
two,
which
covered
on
this
side,
and
every
one
had
two,
which
covered
on
that
side,
their
bodies.
001:024
And
when
they
went,
I
heard
the
noise
of
their
wings,
like
the
noise
of
great
waters,
as
the
voice
of
the
Almighty,
the
voice
of
speech,
as
the
noise
of
an
host:
when
they
stood,
they
let
down
their
wings.
001:025
And
there
was
a
voice
from
the
firmament
that
was
over
their
heads,
when
they
stood,
and
had
let
down
their
wings.
001:026
And
above
the
firmament
that
was
over
their
heads
was
the
likeness
of
a
throne,
as
the
appearance
of
a
sapphire
stone:
and
upon
the
likeness
of
the
throne
was
the
likeness
as
the
appearance
of
a
man
above
upon
it.
001:027
And
I
saw
as
the
colour
of
amber,
as
the
appearance
of
fire
round
about
within
it,
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
upward,
and
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
downward,
I
saw
as
it
were
the
appearance
of
fire,
and
it
had
brightness
round
about.
001:028
As
the
appearance
of
the
bow
that
is
in
the
cloud
in
the
day
of
rain,
so
was
the
appearance
of
the
brightness
round
about.
This
was
the
appearance
of
the
likeness
of
the
glory
of
the
LORD.
And
when
I
saw
it,
I
fell
upon
my
face,
and
I
heard
a
voice
of
one
that
spake.
002:001
And
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
stand
upon
thy
feet,
and
I
will
speak
unto
thee.
002:002
And
the
spirit
entered
into
me
when
he
spake
unto
me,
and
set
me
upon
my
feet,
that
I
heard
him
that
spake
unto
me.
002:003
And
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
I
send
thee
to
the
children
of
Israel,
to
a
rebellious
nation
that
hath
rebelled
against
me:
they
and
their
fathers
have
transgressed
against
me,
even
unto
this
very
day.
002:004
For
they
are
impudent
children
and
stiffhearted.
I
do
send
thee
unto
them;
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
002:005
And
they,
whether
they
will
hear,
or
whether
they
will
forbear,
(for
they
are
a
rebellious
house,)
yet
shall
know
that
there
hath
been
a
prophet
among
them.
002:006
And
thou,
son
of
man,
be
not
afraid
of
them,
neither
be
afraid
of
their
words,
though
briers
and
thorns
be
with
thee,
and
thou
dost
dwell
among
scorpions:
be
not
afraid
of
their
words,
nor
be
dismayed
at
their
looks,
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house.
002:007
And
thou
shalt
speak
my
words
unto
them,
whether
they
will
hear,
or
whether
they
will
forbear:
for
they
are
most
rebellious.
002:008
But
thou,
son
of
man,
hear
what
I
say
unto
thee;
Be
not
thou
rebellious
like
that
rebellious
house:
open
thy
mouth,
and
eat
that
I
give
thee.
002:009
And
when
I
looked,
behold,
an
hand
was
sent
unto
me;
and,
lo,
a
roll
of
a
book
was
therein;
002:010
And
he
spread
it
before
me;
and
it
was
written
within
and
without:
and
there
was
written
therein
lamentations,
and
mourning,
and
woe.
003:001
Moreover
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
eat
that
thou
findest;
eat
this
roll,
and
go
speak
unto
the
house
of
Israel.
003:002
So
I
opened
my
mouth,
and
he
caused
me
to
eat
that
roll.
003:003
And
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
cause
thy
belly
to
eat,
and
fill
thy
bowels
with
this
roll
that
I
give
thee.
Then
did
I
eat
it;
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
as
honey
for
sweetness.
003:004
And
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
go,
get
thee
unto
the
house
of
Israel,
and
speak
with
my
words
unto
them.
003:005
For
thou
art
not
sent
to
a
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
of
an
hard
language,
but
to
the
house
of
Israel;
003:006
Not
to
many
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
of
an
hard
language,
whose
words
thou
canst
not
understand.
Surely,
had
I
sent
thee
to
them,
they
would
have
hearkened
unto
thee.
003:007
But
the
house
of
Israel
will
not
hearken
unto
thee;
for
they
will
not
hearken
unto
me:
for
all
the
house
of
Israel
are
impudent
and
hardhearted.
003:008
Behold,
I
have
made
thy
face
strong
against
their
faces,
and
thy
forehead
strong
against
their
foreheads.
003:009
As
an
adamant
harder
than
flint
have
I
made
thy
forehead:
fear
them
not,
neither
be
dismayed
at
their
looks,
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house.
003:010
Moreover
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
all
my
words
that
I
shall
speak
unto
thee
receive
in
thine
heart,
and
hear
with
thine
ears.
003:011
And
go,
get
thee
to
them
of
the
captivity,
unto
the
children
of
thy
people,
and
speak
unto
them,
and
tell
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
whether
they
will
hear,
or
whether
they
will
forbear.
003:012
Then
the
spirit
took
me
up,
and
I
heard
behind
me
a
voice
of
a
great
rushing,
saying,
Blessed
be
the
glory
of
the
LORD
from
his
place.
003:013
I
heard
also
the
noise
of
the
wings
of
the
living
creatures
that
touched
one
another,
and
the
noise
of
the
wheels
over
against
them,
and
a
noise
of
a
great
rushing.
003:014
So
the
spirit
lifted
me
up,
and
took
me
away,
and
I
went
in
bitterness,
in
the
heat
of
my
spirit;
but
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
strong
upon
me.
003:015
Then
I
came
to
them
of
the
captivity
at
Telabib,
that
dwelt
by
the
river
of
Chebar,
and
I
sat
where
they
sat,
and
remained
there
astonished
among
them
seven
days.
003:016
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
seven
days,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
003:017
Son
of
man,
I
have
made
thee
a
watchman
unto
the
house
of
Israel:
therefore
hear
the
word
at
my
mouth,
and
give
them
warning
from
me.
003:018
When
I
say
unto
the
wicked,
Thou
shalt
surely
die;
and
thou
givest
him
not
warning,
nor
speakest
to
warn
the
wicked
from
his
wicked
way,
to
save
his
life;
the
same
wicked
man
shall
die
in
his
iniquity;
but
his
blood
will
I
require
at
thine
hand.
003:019
Yet
if
thou
warn
the
wicked,
and
he
turn
not
from
his
wickedness,
nor
from
his
wicked
way,
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity;
but
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul.
003:020
Again,
When
a
righteous
man
doth
turn
from
his
righteousness,
and
commit
iniquity,
and
I
lay
a
stumbling-block
before
him,
he
shall
die:
because
thou
hast
not
given
him
warning,
he
shall
die
in
his
sin,
and
his
righteousness
which
he
hath
done
shall
not
be
remembered;
but
his
blood
will
I
require
at
thine
hand.
003:021
Nevertheless
if
thou
warn
the
righteous
man,
that
the
righteous
sin
not,
and
he
doth
not
sin,
he
shall
surely
live,
because
he
is
warned;
also
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul.
003:022
And
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
there
upon
me;
and
he
said
unto
me,
Arise,
go
forth
into
the
plain,
and
I
will
there
talk
with
thee.
003:023
Then
I
arose,
and
went
forth
into
the
plain:
and,
behold,
the
glory
of
the
LORD
stood
there,
as
the
glory
which
I
saw
by
the
river
of
Chebar:
and
I
fell
on
my
face.
003:024
Then
the
spirit
entered
into
me,
and
set
me
upon
my
feet,
and
spake
with
me,
and
said
unto
me,
Go,
shut
thyself
within
thine
house.
003:025
But
thou,
O
son
of
man,
behold,
they
shall
put
bands
upon
thee,
and
shall
bind
thee
with
them,
and
thou
shalt
not
go
out
among
them:
003:026
And
I
will
make
thy
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
thy
mouth,
that
thou
shalt
be
dumb,
and
shalt
not
be
to
them
a
reprover:
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house.
003:027
But
when
I
speak
with
thee,
I
will
open
thy
mouth,
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
He
that
heareth,
let
him
hear;
and
he
that
forbeareth,
let
him
forbear:
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house.
004:001
Thou
also,
son
of
man,
take
thee
a
tile,
and
lay
it
before
thee,
and
pourtray
upon
it
the
city,
even
Jerusalem:
004:002
And
lay
siege
against
it,
and
build
a
fort
against
it,
and
cast
a
mount
against
it;
set
the
camp
also
against
it,
and
set
battering
rams
against
it
round
about.
004:003
Moreover
take
thou
unto
thee
an
iron
pan,
and
set
it
for
a
wall
of
iron
between
thee
and
the
city:
and
set
thy
face
against
it,
and
it
shall
be
besieged,
and
thou
shalt
lay
siege
against
it.
This
shall
be
a
sign
to
the
house
of
Israel.
004:004
Lie
thou
also
upon
thy
left
side,
and
lay
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
Israel
upon
it:
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
that
thou
shalt
lie
upon
it
thou
shalt
bear
their
iniquity.
004:005
For
I
have
laid
upon
thee
the
years
of
their
iniquity,
according
to
the
number
of
the
days,
three
hundred
and
ninety
days:
so
shalt
thou
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
Israel.
004:006
And
when
thou
hast
accomplished
them,
lie
again
on
thy
right
side,
and
thou
shalt
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
Judah
forty
days:
I
have
appointed
thee
each
day
for
a
year.
004:007
Therefore
thou
shalt
set
thy
face
toward
the
siege
of
Jerusalem,
and
thine
arm
shall
be
uncovered,
and
thou
shalt
prophesy
against
it.
004:008
And,
behold,
I
will
lay
bands
upon
thee,
and
thou
shalt
not
turn
thee
from
one
side
to
another,
till
thou
hast
ended
the
days
of
thy
siege.
004:009
Take
thou
also
unto
thee
wheat,
and
barley,
and
beans,
and
lentiles,
and
millet,
and
fitches,
and
put
them
in
one
vessel,
and
make
thee
bread
thereof,
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
that
thou
shalt
lie
upon
thy
side,
three
hundred
and
ninety
days
shalt
thou
eat
thereof.
004:010
And
thy
meat
which
thou
shalt
eat
shall
be
by
weight,
twenty
shekels
a
day:
from
time
to
time
shalt
thou
eat
it.
004:011
Thou
shalt
drink
also
water
by
measure,
the
sixth
part
of
an
hin:
from
time
to
time
shalt
thou
drink.
004:012
And
thou
shalt
eat
it
as
barley
cakes,
and
thou
shalt
bake
it
with
dung
that
cometh
out
of
man,
in
their
sight.
004:013
And
the
LORD
said,
Even
thus
shall
the
children
of
Israel
eat
their
defiled
bread
among
the
Gentiles,
whither
I
will
drive
them.
004:014
Then
said
I,
Ah
Lord
GOD!
behold,
my
soul
hath
not
been
polluted:
for
from
my
youth
up
even
till
now
have
I
not
eaten
of
that
which
dieth
of
itself,
or
is
torn
in
pieces;
neither
came
there
abominable
flesh
into
my
mouth.
004:015
Then
he
said
unto
me,
Lo,
I
have
given
thee
cow's
dung
for
man's
dung,
and
thou
shalt
prepare
thy
bread
therewith.
004:016
Moreover
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
behold,
I
will
break
the
staff
of
bread
in
Jerusalem:
and
they
shall
eat
bread
by
weight,
and
with
care;
and
they
shall
drink
water
by
measure,
and
with
astonishment:
004:017
That
they
may
want
bread
and
water,
and
be
astonied
one
with
another,
and
consume
away
for
their
iniquity.
005:001
And
thou,
son
of
man,
take
thee
a
sharp
knife,
take
thee
a
barber's
razor,
and
cause
it
to
pass
upon
thine
head
and
upon
thy
beard:
then
take
thee
balances
to
weigh,
and
divide
the
hair.
005:002
Thou
shalt
burn
with
fire
a
third
part
in
the
midst
of
the
city,
when
the
days
of
the
siege
are
fulfilled:
and
thou
shalt
take
a
third
part,
and
smite
about
it
with
a
knife:
and
a
third
part
thou
shalt
scatter
in
the
wind;
and
I
will
draw
out
a
sword
after
them.
005:003
Thou
shalt
also
take
thereof
a
few
in
number,
and
bind
them
in
thy
skirts.
005:004
Then
take
of
them
again,
and
cast
them
into
the
midst
of
the
fire,
and
burn
them
in
the
fire;
for
thereof
shall
a
fire
come
forth
into
all
the
house
of
Israel.
005:005
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
This
is
Jerusalem:
I
have
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
nations
and
countries
that
are
round
about
her.
005:006
And
she
hath
changed
my
judgments
into
wickedness
more
than
the
nations,
and
my
statutes
more
than
the
countries
that
are
round
about
her:
for
they
have
refused
my
judgments
and
my
statutes,
they
have
not
walked
in
them.
005:007
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
ye
multiplied
more
than
the
nations
that
are
round
about
you,
and
have
not
walked
in
my
statutes,
neither
have
kept
my
judgments,
neither
have
done
according
to
the
judgments
of
the
nations
that
are
round
about
you;
005:008
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I,
even
I,
am
against
thee,
and
will
execute
judgments
in
the
midst
of
thee
in
the
sight
of
the
nations.
005:009
And
I
will
do
in
thee
that
which
I
have
not
done,
and
whereunto
I
will
not
do
any
more
the
like,
because
of
all
thine
abominations.
005:010
Therefore
the
fathers
shall
eat
the
sons
in
the
midst
of
thee,
and
the
sons
shall
eat
their
fathers;
and
I
will
execute
judgments
in
thee,
and
the
whole
remnant
of
thee
will
I
scatter
into
all
the
winds.
005:011
Wherefore,
as
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Surely,
because
thou
hast
defiled
my
sanctuary
with
all
thy
detestable
things,
and
with
all
thine
abominations,
therefore
will
I
also
diminish
thee;
neither
shall
mine
eye
spare,
neither
will
I
have
any
pity.
005:012
A
third
part
of
thee
shall
die
with
the
pestilence,
and
with
famine
shall
they
be
consumed
in
the
midst
of
thee:
and
a
third
part
shall
fall
by
the
sword
round
about
thee;
and
I
will
scatter
a
third
part
into
all
the
winds,
and
I
will
draw
out
a
sword
after
them.
005:013
Thus
shall
mine
anger
be
accomplished,
and
I
will
cause
my
fury
to
rest
upon
them,
and
I
will
be
comforted:
and
they
shall
know
that
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it
in
my
zeal,
when
I
have
accomplished
my
fury
in
them.
005:014
Moreover
I
will
make
thee
waste,
and
a
reproach
among
the
nations
that
are
round
about
thee,
in
the
sight
of
all
that
pass
by.
005:015
So
it
shall
be
a
reproach
and
a
taunt,
an
instruction
and
an
astonishment
unto
the
nations
that
are
round
about
thee,
when
I
shall
execute
judgments
in
thee
in
anger
and
in
fury
and
in
furious
rebukes.
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it.
005:016
When
I
shall
send
upon
them
the
evil
arrows
of
famine,
which
shall
be
for
their
destruction,
and
which
I
will
send
to
destroy
you:
and
I
will
increase
the
famine
upon
you,
and
will
break
your
staff
of
bread:
005:017
So
will
I
send
upon
you
famine
and
evil
beasts,
and
they
shall
bereave
thee:
and
pestilence
and
blood
shall
pass
through
thee;
and
I
will
bring
the
sword
upon
thee.
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it.
006:001
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
006:002
Son
of
man,
set
thy
face
toward
the
mountains
of
Israel,
and
prophesy
against
them,
006:003
And
say,
Ye
mountains
of
Israel,
hear
the
word
of
the
Lord
GOD;
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
to
the
mountains,
and
to
the
hills,
to
the
rivers,
and
to
the
valleys;
Behold,
I,
even
I,
will
bring
a
sword
upon
you,
and
I
will
destroy
your
high
places.
006:004
And
your
altars
shall
be
desolate,
and
your
images
shall
be
broken:
and
I
will
cast
down
your
slain
men
before
your
idols.
006:005
And
I
will
lay
the
dead
carcases
of
the
children
of
Israel
before
their
idols;
and
I
will
scatter
your
bones
round
about
your
altars.
006:006
In
all
your
dwellingplaces
the
cities
shall
be
laid
waste,
and
the
high
places
shall
be
desolate;
that
your
altars
may
be
laid
waste
and
made
desolate,
and
your
idols
may
be
broken
and
cease,
and
your
images
may
be
cut
down,
and
your
works
may
be
abolished.
006:007
And
the
slain
shall
fall
in
the
midst
of
you,
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
006:008
Yet
will
I
leave
a
remnant,
that
ye
may
have
some
that
shall
escape
the
sword
among
the
nations,
when
ye
shall
be
scattered
through
the
countries.
006:009
And
they
that
escape
of
you
shall
remember
me
among
the
nations
whither
they
shall
be
carried
captives,
because
I
am
broken
with
their
whorish
heart,
which
hath
departed
from
me,
and
with
their
eyes,
which
go
a
whoring
after
their
idols:
and
they
shall
lothe
themselves
for
the
evils
which
they
have
committed
in
all
their
abominations.
006:010
And
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
and
that
I
have
not
said
in
vain
that
I
would
do
this
evil
unto
them.
006:011
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Smite
with
thine
hand,
and
stamp
with
thy
foot,
and
say,
Alas
for
all
the
evil
abominations
of
the
house
of
Israel!
for
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword,
by
the
famine,
and
by
the
pestilence.
006:012
He
that
is
far
off
shall
die
of
the
pestilence;
and
he
that
is
near
shall
fall
by
the
sword;
and
he
that
remaineth
and
is
besieged
shall
die
by
the
famine:
thus
will
I
accomplish
my
fury
upon
them.
006:013
Then
shall
ye
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
their
slain
men
shall
be
among
their
idols
round
about
their
altars,
upon
every
high
hill,
in
all
the
tops
of
the
mountains,
and
under
every
green
tree,
and
under
every
thick
oak,
the
place
where
they
did
offer
sweet
savour
to
all
their
idols.
006:014
So
will
I
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
them,
and
make
the
land
desolate,
yea,
more
desolate
than
the
wilderness
toward
Diblath,
in
all
their
habitations:
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
007:001
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
007:002
Also,
thou
son
of
man,
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
unto
the
land
of
Israel;
An
end,
the
end
is
come
upon
the
four
corners
of
the
land.
007:003
Now
is
the
end
come
upon
thee,
and
I
will
send
mine
anger
upon
thee,
and
will
judge
thee
according
to
thy
ways,
and
will
recompense
upon
thee
all
thine
abominations.
007:004
And
mine
eye
shall
not
spare
thee,
neither
will
I
have
pity:
but
I
will
recompense
thy
ways
upon
thee,
and
thine
abominations
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
thee:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
007:005
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
An
evil,
an
only
evil,
behold,
is
come.
007:006
An
end
is
come,
the
end
is
come:
it
watcheth
for
thee;
behold,
it
is
come.
007:007
The
morning
is
come
unto
thee,
O
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
land:
the
time
is
come,
the
day
of
trouble
is
near,
and
not
the
sounding
again
of
the
mountains.
007:008
Now
will
I
shortly
pour
out
my
fury
upon
thee,
and
accomplish
mine
anger
upon
thee:
and
I
will
judge
thee
according
to
thy
ways,
and
will
recompense
thee
for
all
thine
abominations.
007:009
And
mine
eye
shall
not
spare,
neither
will
I
have
pity:
I
will
recompense
thee
according
to
thy
ways
and
thine
abominations
that
are
in
the
midst
of
thee;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
that
smiteth.
007:010
Behold
the
day,
behold,
it
is
come:
the
morning
is
gone
forth;
the
rod
hath
blossomed,
pride
hath
budded.
007:011
Violence
is
risen
up
into
a
rod
of
wickedness:
none
of
them
shall
remain,
nor
of
their
multitude,
nor
of
any
of
their's:
neither
shall
there
be
wailing
for
them.
007:012
The
time
is
come,
the
day
draweth
near:
let
not
the
buyer
rejoice,
nor
the
seller
mourn:
for
wrath
is
upon
all
the
multitude
thereof.
007:013
For
the
seller
shall
not
return
to
that
which
is
sold,
although
they
were
yet
alive:
for
the
vision
is
touching
the
whole
multitude
thereof,
which
shall
not
return;
neither
shall
any
strengthen
himself
in
the
iniquity
of
his
life.
007:014
They
have
blown
the
trumpet,
even
to
make
all
ready;
but
none
goeth
to
the
battle:
for
my
wrath
is
upon
all
the
multitude
thereof.
007:015
The
sword
is
without,
and
the
pestilence
and
the
famine
within:
he
that
is
in
the
field
shall
die
with
the
sword;
and
he
that
is
in
the
city,
famine
and
pestilence
shall
devour
him.
007:016
But
they
that
escape
of
them
shall
escape,
and
shall
be
on
the
mountains
like
doves
of
the
valleys,
all
of
them
mourning,
every
one
for
his
iniquity.
007:017
All
hands
shall
be
feeble,
and
all
knees
shall
be
weak
as
water.
007:018
They
shall
also
gird
themselves
with
sackcloth,
and
horror
shall
cover
them;
and
shame
shall
be
upon
all
faces,
and
baldness
upon
all
their
heads.
007:019
They
shall
cast
their
silver
in
the
streets,
and
their
gold
shall
be
removed:
their
silver
and
their
gold
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
them
in
the
day
of
the
wrath
of
the
LORD:
they
shall
not
satisfy
their
souls,
neither
fill
their
bowels:
because
it
is
the
stumblingblock
of
their
iniquity.
007:020
As
for
the
beauty
of
his
ornament,
he
set
it
in
majesty:
but
they
made
the
images
of
their
abominations
and
of
their
detestable
things
therein:
therefore
have
I
set
it
far
from
them.
007:021
And
I
will
give
it
into
the
hands
of
the
strangers
for
a
