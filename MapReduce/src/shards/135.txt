prey,
and
to
the
wicked
of
the
earth
for
a
spoil;
and
they
shall
pollute
it.
007:022
My
face
will
I
turn
also
from
them,
and
they
shall
pollute
my
secret
place:
for
the
robbers
shall
enter
into
it,
and
defile
it.
007:023
Make
a
chain:
for
the
land
is
full
of
bloody
crimes,
and
the
city
is
full
of
violence.
007:024
Wherefore
I
will
bring
the
worst
of
the
heathen,
and
they
shall
possess
their
houses:
I
will
also
make
the
pomp
of
the
strong
to
cease;
and
their
holy
places
shall
be
defiled.
007:025
Destruction
cometh;
and
they
shall
seek
peace,
and
there
shall
be
none.
007:026
Mischief
shall
come
upon
mischief,
and
rumour
shall
be
upon
rumour;
then
shall
they
seek
a
vision
of
the
prophet;
but
the
law
shall
perish
from
the
priest,
and
counsel
from
the
ancients.
007:027
The
king
shall
mourn,
and
the
prince
shall
be
clothed
with
desolation,
and
the
hands
of
the
people
of
the
land
shall
be
troubled:
I
will
do
unto
them
after
their
way,
and
according
to
their
deserts
will
I
judge
them;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
008:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixth
year,
in
the
sixth
month,
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month,
as
I
sat
in
mine
house,
and
the
elders
of
Judah
sat
before
me,
that
the
hand
of
the
Lord
GOD
fell
there
upon
me.
008:002
Then
I
beheld,
and
lo
a
likeness
as
the
appearance
of
fire:
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
downward,
fire;
and
from
his
loins
even
upward,
as
the
appearance
of
brightness,
as
the
colour
of
amber.
008:003
And
he
put
forth
the
form
of
an
hand,
and
took
me
by
a
lock
of
mine
head;
and
the
spirit
lifted
me
up
between
the
earth
and
the
heaven,
and
brought
me
in
the
visions
of
God
to
Jerusalem,
to
the
door
of
the
inner
gate
that
looketh
toward
the
north;
where
was
the
seat
of
the
image
of
jealousy,
which
provoketh
to
jealousy.
008:004
And,
behold,
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
was
there,
according
to
the
vision
that
I
saw
in
the
plain.
008:005
Then
said
he
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
lift
up
thine
eyes
now
the
way
toward
the
north.
So
I
lifted
up
mine
eyes
the
way
toward
the
north,
and
behold
northward
at
the
gate
of
the
altar
this
image
of
jealousy
in
the
entry.
008:006
He
said
furthermore
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
seest
thou
what
they
do?
even
the
great
abominations
that
the
house
of
Israel
committeth
here,
that
I
should
go
far
off
from
my
sanctuary?
but
turn
thee
yet
again,
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations.
008:007
And
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
court;
and
when
I
looked,
behold
a
hole
in
the
wall.
008:008
Then
said
he
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
dig
now
in
the
wall:
and
when
I
had
digged
in
the
wall,
behold
a
door.
008:009
And
he
said
unto
me,
Go
in,
and
behold
the
wicked
abominations
that
they
do
here.
008:010
So
I
went
in
and
saw;
and
behold
every
form
of
creeping
things,
and
abominable
beasts,
and
all
the
idols
of
the
house
of
Israel,
pourtrayed
upon
the
wall
round
about.
008:011
And
there
stood
before
them
seventy
men
of
the
ancients
of
the
house
of
Israel,
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
Shaphan,
with
every
man
his
censer
in
his
hand;
and
a
thick
cloud
of
incense
went
up.
008:012
Then
said
he
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
hast
thou
seen
what
the
ancients
of
the
house
of
Israel
do
in
the
dark,
every
man
in
the
chambers
of
his
imagery?
for
they
say,
the
LORD
seeth
us
not;
the
LORD
hath
forsaken
the
earth.
008:013
He
said
also
unto
me,
Turn
thee
yet
again,
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
that
they
do.
008:014
Then
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
gate
of
the
LORD's
house
which
was
toward
the
north;
and,
behold,
there
sat
women
weeping
for
Tammuz.
008:015
Then
said
he
unto
me,
Hast
thou
seen
this,
O
son
of
man?
turn
thee
yet
again,
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
than
these.
008:016
And
he
brought
me
into
the
inner
court
of
the
LORD's
house,
and,
behold,
at
the
door
of
the
temple
of
the
LORD,
between
the
porch
and
the
altar,
were
about
five
and
twenty
men,
with
their
backs
toward
the
temple
of
the
LORD,
and
their
faces
toward
the
east;
and
they
worshipped
the
sun
toward
the
east.
008:017
Then
he
said
unto
me,
Hast
thou
seen
this,
O
son
of
man?
Is
it
a
light
thing
to
the
house
of
Judah
that
they
commit
the
abominations
which
they
commit
here?
for
they
have
filled
the
land
with
violence,
and
have
returned
to
provoke
me
to
anger:
and,
lo,
they
put
the
branch
to
their
nose.
008:018
Therefore
will
I
also
deal
in
fury:
mine
eye
shall
not
spare,
neither
will
I
have
pity:
and
though
they
cry
in
mine
ears
with
a
loud
voice,
yet
will
I
not
hear
them.
009:001
He
cried
also
in
mine
ears
with
a
loud
voice,
saying,
Cause
them
that
have
charge
over
the
city
to
draw
near,
even
every
man
with
his
destroying
weapon
in
his
hand.
009:002
And,
behold,
six
men
came
from
the
way
of
the
higher
gate,
which
lieth
toward
the
north,
and
every
man
a
slaughter
weapon
in
his
hand;
and
one
man
among
them
was
clothed
with
linen,
with
a
writer's
inkhorn
by
his
side:
and
they
went
in,
and
stood
beside
the
brasen
altar.
009:003
And
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
was
gone
up
from
the
cherub,
whereupon
he
was,
to
the
threshold
of
the
house.
And
he
called
to
the
man
clothed
with
linen,
which
had
the
writer's
inkhorn
by
his
side;
009:004
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Go
through
the
midst
of
the
city,
through
the
midst
of
Jerusalem,
and
set
a
mark
upon
the
foreheads
of
the
men
that
sigh
and
that
cry
for
all
the
abominations
that
be
done
in
the
midst
thereof.
009:005
And
to
the
others
he
said
in
mine
hearing,
Go
ye
after
him
through
the
city,
and
smite:
let
not
your
eye
spare,
neither
have
ye
pity:
009:006
Slay
utterly
old
and
young,
both
maids,
and
little
children,
and
women:
but
come
not
near
any
man
upon
whom
is
the
mark;
and
begin
at
my
sanctuary.
Then
they
began
at
the
ancient
men
which
were
before
the
house.
009:007
And
he
said
unto
them,
Defile
the
house,
and
fill
the
courts
with
the
slain:
go
ye
forth.
And
they
went
forth,
and
slew
in
the
city.
009:008
And
it
came
to
pass,
while
they
were
slaying
them,
and
I
was
left,
that
I
fell
upon
my
face,
and
cried,
and
said,
Ah
Lord
GOD!
wilt
thou
destroy
all
the
residue
of
Israel
in
thy
pouring
out
of
thy
fury
upon
Jerusalem?
009:009
Then
said
he
unto
me,
The
iniquity
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
Judah
is
exceeding
great,
and
the
land
is
full
of
blood,
and
the
city
full
of
perverseness:
for
they
say,
The
LORD
hath
forsaken
the
earth,
and
the
LORD
seeth
not.
009:010
And
as
for
me
also,
mine
eye
shall
not
spare,
neither
will
I
have
pity,
but
I
will
recompense
their
way
upon
their
head.
009:011
And,
behold,
the
man
clothed
with
linen,
which
had
the
inkhorn
by
his
side,
reported
the
matter,
saying,
I
have
done
as
thou
hast
commanded
me.
010:001
Then
I
looked,
and,
behold,
in
the
firmament
that
was
above
the
head
of
the
cherubims
there
appeared
over
them
as
it
were
a
sapphire
stone,
as
the
appearance
of
the
likeness
of
a
throne.
010:002
And
he
spake
unto
the
man
clothed
with
linen,
and
said,
Go
in
between
the
wheels,
even
under
the
cherub,
and
fill
thine
hand
with
coals
of
fire
from
between
the
cherubims,
and
scatter
them
over
the
city.
And
he
went
in
in
my
sight.
010:003
Now
the
cherubims
stood
on
the
right
side
of
the
house,
when
the
man
went
in;
and
the
cloud
filled
the
inner
court.
010:004
Then
the
glory
of
the
LORD
went
up
from
the
cherub,
and
stood
over
the
threshold
of
the
house;
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
cloud,
and
the
court
was
full
of
the
brightness
of
the
LORD's
glory.
010:005
And
the
sound
of
the
cherubims'
wings
was
heard
even
to
the
outer
court,
as
the
voice
of
the
Almighty
God
when
he
speaketh.
010:006
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
he
had
commanded
the
man
clothed
with
linen,
saying,
Take
fire
from
between
the
wheels,
from
between
the
cherubims;
then
he
went
in,
and
stood
beside
the
wheels.
010:007
And
one
cherub
stretched
forth
his
hand
from
between
the
cherubims
unto
the
fire
that
was
between
the
cherubims,
and
took
thereof,
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
him
that
was
clothed
with
linen:
who
took
it,
and
went
out.
010:008
And
there
appeared
in
the
cherubims
the
form
of
a
man's
hand
under
their
wings.
010:009
And
when
I
looked,
behold
the
four
wheels
by
the
cherubims,
one
wheel
by
one
cherub,
and
another
wheel
by
another
cherub:
and
the
appearance
of
the
wheels
was
as
the
colour
of
a
beryl
stone.
010:010
And
as
for
their
appearances,
they
four
had
one
likeness,
as
if
a
wheel
had
been
in
the
midst
of
a
wheel.
010:011
When
they
went,
they
went
upon
their
four
sides;
they
turned
not
as
they
went,
but
to
the
place
whither
the
head
looked
they
followed
it;
they
turned
not
as
they
went.
010:012
And
their
whole
body,
and
their
backs,
and
their
hands,
and
their
wings,
and
the
wheels,
were
full
of
eyes
round
about,
even
the
wheels
that
they
four
had.
010:013
As
for
the
wheels,
it
was
cried
unto
them
in
my
hearing,
O
wheel.
010:014
And
every
one
had
four
faces:
the
first
face
was
the
face
of
a
cherub,
and
the
second
face
was
the
face
of
a
man,
and
the
third
the
face
of
a
lion,
and
the
fourth
the
face
of
an
eagle.
010:015
And
the
cherubims
were
lifted
up.
This
is
the
living
creature
that
I
saw
by
the
river
of
Chebar.
010:016
And
when
the
cherubims
went,
the
wheels
went
by
them:
and
when
the
cherubims
lifted
up
their
wings
to
mount
up
from
the
earth,
the
same
wheels
also
turned
not
from
beside
them.
010:017
When
they
stood,
these
stood;
and
when
they
were
lifted
up,
these
lifted
up
themselves
also:
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
them.
010:018
Then
the
glory
of
the
LORD
departed
from
off
the
threshold
of
the
house,
and
stood
over
the
cherubims.
010:019
And
the
cherubims
lifted
up
their
wings,
and
mounted
up
from
the
earth
in
my
sight:
when
they
went
out,
the
wheels
also
were
beside
them,
and
every
one
stood
at
the
door
of
the
east
gate
of
the
LORD's
house;
and
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
was
over
them
above.
010:020
This
is
the
living
creature
that
I
saw
under
the
God
of
Israel
by
the
river
of
Chebar;
and
I
knew
that
they
were
the
cherubims.
010:021
Every
one
had
four
faces
apiece,
and
every
one
four
wings;
and
the
likeness
of
the
hands
of
a
man
was
under
their
wings.
010:022
And
the
likeness
of
their
faces
was
the
same
faces
which
I
saw
by
the
river
of
Chebar,
their
appearances
and
themselves:
they
went
every
one
straight
forward.
011:001
Moreover
the
spirit
lifted
me
up,
and
brought
me
unto
the
east
gate
of
the
LORD's
house,
which
looketh
eastward:
and
behold
at
the
door
of
the
gate
five
and
twenty
men;
among
whom
I
saw
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
Azur,
and
Pelatiah
the
son
of
Benaiah,
princes
of
the
people.
011:002
Then
said
he
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
these
are
the
men
that
devise
mischief,
and
give
wicked
counsel
in
this
city:
011:003
Which
say,
It
is
not
near;
let
us
build
houses:
this
city
is
the
caldron,
and
we
be
the
flesh.
011:004
Therefore
prophesy
against
them,
prophesy,
O
son
of
man.
011:005
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
fell
upon
me,
and
said
unto
me,
Speak;
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Thus
have
ye
said,
O
house
of
Israel:
for
I
know
the
things
that
come
into
your
mind,
every
one
of
them.
011:006
Ye
have
multiplied
your
slain
in
this
city,
and
ye
have
filled
the
streets
thereof
with
the
slain.
011:007
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Your
slain
whom
ye
have
laid
in
the
midst
of
it,
they
are
the
flesh,
and
this
city
is
the
caldron:
but
I
will
bring
you
forth
out
of
the
midst
of
it.
011:008
Ye
have
feared
the
sword;
and
I
will
bring
a
sword
upon
you,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
011:009
And
I
will
bring
you
out
of
the
midst
thereof,
and
deliver
you
into
the
hands
of
strangers,
and
will
execute
judgments
among
you.
011:010
Ye
shall
fall
by
the
sword;
I
will
judge
you
in
the
border
of
Israel;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
011:011
This
city
shall
not
be
your
caldron,
neither
shall
ye
be
the
flesh
in
the
midst
thereof;
but
I
will
judge
you
in
the
border
of
Israel:
011:012
And
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD:
for
ye
have
not
walked
in
my
statutes,
neither
executed
my
judgments,
but
have
done
after
the
manners
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about
you.
011:013
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
I
prophesied,
that
Pelatiah
the
son
of
Benaiah
died.
Then
fell
I
down
upon
my
face,
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
and
said,
Ah
Lord
GOD!
wilt
thou
make
a
full
end
of
the
remnant
of
Israel?
011:014
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
011:015
Son
of
man,
thy
brethren,
even
thy
brethren,
the
men
of
thy
kindred,
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
wholly,
are
they
unto
whom
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
have
said,
Get
you
far
from
the
LORD:
unto
us
is
this
land
given
in
possession.
011:016
Therefore
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Although
I
have
cast
them
far
off
among
the
heathen,
and
although
I
have
scattered
them
among
the
countries,
yet
will
I
be
to
them
as
a
little
sanctuary
in
the
countries
where
they
shall
come.
011:017
Therefore
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
even
gather
you
from
the
people,
and
assemble
you
out
of
the
countries
where
ye
have
been
scattered,
and
I
will
give
you
the
land
of
Israel.
011:018
And
they
shall
come
thither,
and
they
shall
take
away
all
the
detestable
things
thereof
and
all
the
abominations
thereof
from
thence.
011:019
And
I
will
give
them
one
heart,
and
I
will
put
a
new
spirit
within
you;
and
I
will
take
the
stony
heart
out
of
their
flesh,
and
will
give
them
an
heart
of
flesh:
011:020
That
they
may
walk
in
my
statutes,
and
keep
mine
ordinances,
and
do
them:
and
they
shall
be
my
people,
and
I
will
be
their
God.
011:021
But
as
for
them
whose
heart
walketh
after
the
heart
of
their
detestable
things
and
their
abominations,
I
will
recompense
their
way
upon
their
own
heads,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
011:022
Then
did
the
cherubims
lift
up
their
wings,
and
the
wheels
beside
them;
and
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
was
over
them
above.
011:023
And
the
glory
of
the
LORD
went
up
from
the
midst
of
the
city,
and
stood
upon
the
mountain
which
is
on
the
east
side
of
the
city.
011:024
Afterwards
the
spirit
took
me
up,
and
brought
me
in
a
vision
by
the
Spirit
of
God
into
Chaldea,
to
them
of
the
captivity.
So
the
vision
that
I
had
seen
went
up
from
me.
011:025
Then
I
spake
unto
them
of
the
captivity
all
the
things
that
the
LORD
had
shewed
me.
012:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
also
came
unto
me,
saying,
012:002
Son
of
man,
thou
dwellest
in
the
midst
of
a
rebellious
house,
which
have
eyes
to
see,
and
see
not;
they
have
ears
to
hear,
and
hear
not:
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house.
012:003
Therefore,
thou
son
of
man,
prepare
thee
stuff
for
removing,
and
remove
by
day
in
their
sight;
and
thou
shalt
remove
from
thy
place
to
another
place
in
their
sight:
it
may
be
they
will
consider,
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house.
012:004
Then
shalt
thou
bring
forth
thy
stuff
by
day
in
their
sight,
as
stuff
for
removing:
and
thou
shalt
go
forth
at
even
in
their
sight,
as
they
that
go
forth
into
captivity.
012:005
Dig
thou
through
the
wall
in
their
sight,
and
carry
out
thereby.
012:006
In
their
sight
shalt
thou
bear
it
upon
thy
shoulders,
and
carry
it
forth
in
the
twilight:
thou
shalt
cover
thy
face,
that
thou
see
not
the
ground:
for
I
have
set
thee
for
a
sign
unto
the
house
of
Israel.
012:007
And
I
did
so
as
I
was
commanded:
I
brought
forth
my
stuff
by
day,
as
stuff
for
captivity,
and
in
the
even
I
digged
through
the
wall
with
mine
hand;
I
brought
it
forth
in
the
twilight,
and
I
bare
it
upon
my
shoulder
in
their
sight.
012:008
And
in
the
morning
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
me,
saying,
012:009
Son
of
man,
hath
not
the
house
of
Israel,
the
rebellious
house,
said
unto
thee,
What
doest
thou?
012:010
Say
thou
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
This
burden
concerneth
the
prince
in
Jerusalem,
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
that
are
among
them.
012:011
Say,
I
am
your
sign:
like
as
I
have
done,
so
shall
it
be
done
unto
them:
they
shall
remove
and
go
into
captivity.
012:012
And
the
prince
that
is
among
them
shall
bear
upon
his
shoulder
in
the
twilight,
and
shall
go
forth:
they
shall
dig
through
the
wall
to
carry
out
thereby:
he
shall
cover
his
face,
that
he
see
not
the
ground
with
his
eyes.
012:013
My
net
also
will
I
spread
upon
him,
and
he
shall
be
taken
in
my
snare:
and
I
will
bring
him
to
Babylon
to
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans;
yet
shall
he
not
see
it,
though
he
shall
die
there.
012:014
And
I
will
scatter
toward
every
wind
all
that
are
about
him
to
help
him,
and
all
his
bands;
and
I
will
draw
out
the
sword
after
them.
012:015
And
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
shall
scatter
them
among
the
nations,
and
disperse
them
in
the
countries.
012:016
But
I
will
leave
a
few
men
of
them
from
the
sword,
from
the
famine,
and
from
the
pestilence;
that
they
may
declare
all
their
abominations
among
the
heathen
whither
they
come;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
012:017
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
me,
saying,
012:018
Son
of
man,
eat
thy
bread
with
quaking,
and
drink
thy
water
with
trembling
and
with
carefulness;
012:019
And
say
unto
the
people
of
the
land,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
of
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
and
of
the
land
of
Israel;
They
shall
eat
their
bread
with
carefulness,
and
drink
their
water
with
astonishment,
that
her
land
may
be
desolate
from
all
that
is
therein,
because
of
the
violence
of
all
them
that
dwell
therein.
012:020
And
the
cities
that
are
inhabited
shall
be
laid
waste,
and
the
land
shall
be
desolate;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
012:021
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
012:022
Son
of
man,
what
is
that
proverb
that
ye
have
in
the
land
of
Israel,
saying,
The
days
are
prolonged,
and
every
vision
faileth?
012:023
Tell
them
therefore,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
make
this
proverb
to
cease,
and
they
shall
no
more
use
it
as
a
proverb
in
Israel;
but
say
unto
them,
The
days
are
at
hand,
and
the
effect
of
every
vision.
012:024
For
there
shall
be
no
more
any
vain
vision
nor
flattering
divination
within
the
house
of
Israel.
012:025
For
I
am
the
LORD:
I
will
speak,
and
the
word
that
I
shall
speak
shall
come
to
pass;
it
shall
be
no
more
prolonged:
for
in
your
days,
O
rebellious
house,
will
I
say
the
word,
and
will
perform
it,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
012:026
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
me,
saying.
012:027
Son
of
man,
behold,
they
of
the
house
of
Israel
say,
The
vision
that
he
seeth
is
for
many
days
to
come,
and
he
prophesieth
of
the
times
that
are
far
off.
012:028
Therefore
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
There
shall
none
of
my
words
be
prolonged
any
more,
but
the
word
which
I
have
spoken
shall
be
done,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
013:001
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
013:002
Son
of
man,
prophesy
against
the
prophets
of
Israel
that
prophesy,
and
say
thou
unto
them
that
prophesy
out
of
their
own
hearts,
Hear
ye
the
word
of
the
LORD;
013:003
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Woe
unto
the
foolish
prophets,
that
follow
their
own
spirit,
and
have
seen
nothing!
013:004
O
Israel,
thy
prophets
are
like
the
foxes
in
the
deserts.
013:005
Ye
have
not
gone
up
into
the
gaps,
neither
made
up
the
hedge
for
the
house
of
Israel
to
stand
in
the
battle
in
the
day
of
the
LORD.
013:006
They
have
seen
vanity
and
lying
divination,
saying,
The
LORD
saith:
and
the
LORD
hath
not
sent
them:
and
they
have
made
others
to
hope
that
they
would
confirm
the
word.
013:007
Have
ye
not
seen
a
vain
vision,
and
have
ye
not
spoken
a
lying
divination,
whereas
ye
say,
The
LORD
saith
it;
albeit
I
have
not
spoken?
013:008
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
ye
have
spoken
vanity,
and
seen
lies,
therefore,
behold,
I
am
against
you,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
013:009
And
mine
hand
shall
be
upon
the
prophets
that
see
vanity,
and
that
divine
lies:
they
shall
not
be
in
the
assembly
of
my
people,
neither
shall
they
be
written
in
the
writing
of
the
house
of
Israel,
neither
shall
they
enter
into
the
land
of
Israel;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
GOD.
013:010
Because,
even
because
they
have
seduced
my
people,
saying,
Peace;
and
there
was
no
peace;
and
one
built
up
a
wall,
and,
lo,
others
daubed
it
with
untempered
morter:
013:011
Say
unto
them
which
daub
it
with
untempered
morter,
that
it
shall
fall:
there
shall
be
an
overflowing
shower;
and
ye,
O
great
hailstones,
shall
fall;
and
a
stormy
wind
shall
rend
it.
013:012
Lo,
when
the
wall
is
fallen,
shall
it
not
be
said
unto
you,
Where
is
the
daubing
wherewith
ye
have
daubed
it?
013:013
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
even
rend
it
with
a
stormy
wind
in
my
fury;
and
there
shall
be
an
overflowing
shower
in
mine
anger,
and
great
hailstones
in
my
fury
to
consume
it.
013:014
So
will
I
break
down
the
wall
that
ye
have
daubed
with
untempered
morter,
and
bring
it
down
to
the
ground,
so
that
the
foundation
thereof
shall
be
discovered,
and
it
shall
fall,
and
ye
shall
be
consumed
in
the
midst
thereof:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
013:015
Thus
will
I
accomplish
my
wrath
upon
the
wall,
and
upon
them
that
have
daubed
it
with
untempered
morter,
and
will
say
unto
you,
The
wall
is
no
more,
neither
they
that
daubed
it;
013:016
To
wit,
the
prophets
of
Israel
which
prophesy
concerning
Jerusalem,
and
which
see
visions
of
peace
for
her,
and
there
is
no
peace,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
013:017
Likewise,
thou
son
of
man,
set
thy
face
against
the
daughters
of
thy
people,
which
prophesy
out
of
their
own
heart;
and
prophesy
thou
against
them,
013:018
And
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Woe
to
the
women
that
sew
pillows
to
all
armholes,
and
make
kerchiefs
upon
the
head
of
every
stature
to
hunt
souls!
Will
ye
hunt
the
souls
of
my
people,
and
will
ye
save
the
souls
alive
that
come
unto
you?
013:019
And
