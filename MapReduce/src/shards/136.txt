will
ye
pollute
me
among
my
people
for
handfuls
of
barley
and
for
pieces
of
bread,
to
slay
the
souls
that
should
not
die,
and
to
save
the
souls
alive
that
should
not
live,
by
your
lying
to
my
people
that
hear
your
lies?
013:020
Wherefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
am
against
your
pillows,
wherewith
ye
there
hunt
the
souls
to
make
them
fly,
and
I
will
tear
them
from
your
arms,
and
will
let
the
souls
go,
even
the
souls
that
ye
hunt
to
make
them
fly.
013:021
Your
kerchiefs
also
will
I
tear,
and
deliver
my
people
out
of
your
hand,
and
they
shall
be
no
more
in
your
hand
to
be
hunted;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
013:022
Because
with
lies
ye
have
made
the
heart
of
the
righteous
sad,
whom
I
have
not
made
sad;
and
strengthened
the
hands
of
the
wicked,
that
he
should
not
return
from
his
wicked
way,
by
promising
him
life:
013:023
Therefore
ye
shall
see
no
more
vanity,
nor
divine
divinations:
for
I
will
deliver
my
people
out
of
your
hand:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
014:001
Then
came
certain
of
the
elders
of
Israel
unto
me,
and
sat
before
me.
014:002
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
014:003
Son
of
man,
these
men
have
set
up
their
idols
in
their
heart,
and
put
the
stumblingblock
of
their
iniquity
before
their
face:
should
I
be
enquired
of
at
all
by
them?
014:004
Therefore
speak
unto
them,
and
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Every
man
of
the
house
of
Israel
that
setteth
up
his
idols
in
his
heart,
and
putteth
the
stumblingblock
of
his
iniquity
before
his
face,
and
cometh
to
the
prophet;
I
the
LORD
will
answer
him
that
cometh
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
idols;
014:005
That
I
may
take
the
house
of
Israel
in
their
own
heart,
because
they
are
all
estranged
from
me
through
their
idols.
014:006
Therefore
say
unto
the
house
of
Israel,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Repent,
and
turn
yourselves
from
your
idols;
and
turn
away
your
faces
from
all
your
abominations.
014:007
For
every
one
of
the
house
of
Israel,
or
of
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
in
Israel,
which
separateth
himself
from
me,
and
setteth
up
his
idols
in
his
heart,
and
putteth
the
stumblingblock
of
his
iniquity
before
his
face,
and
cometh
to
a
prophet
to
enquire
of
him
concerning
me;
I
the
LORD
will
answer
him
by
myself:
014:008
And
I
will
set
my
face
against
that
man,
and
will
make
him
a
sign
and
a
proverb,
and
I
will
cut
him
off
from
the
midst
of
my
people;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
014:009
And
if
the
prophet
be
deceived
when
he
hath
spoken
a
thing,
I
the
LORD
have
deceived
that
prophet,
and
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
him,
and
will
destroy
him
from
the
midst
of
my
people
Israel.
014:010
And
they
shall
bear
the
punishment
of
their
iniquity:
the
punishment
of
the
prophet
shall
be
even
as
the
punishment
of
him
that
seeketh
unto
him;
014:011
That
the
house
of
Israel
may
go
no
more
astray
from
me,
neither
be
polluted
any
more
with
all
their
transgressions;
but
that
they
may
be
my
people,
and
I
may
be
their
God,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
014:012
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
to
me,
saying,
014:013
Son
of
man,
when
the
land
sinneth
against
me
by
trespassing
grievously,
then
will
I
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
it,
and
will
break
the
staff
of
the
bread
thereof,
and
will
send
famine
upon
it,
and
will
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it:
014:014
Though
these
three
men,
Noah,
Daniel,
and
Job,
were
in
it,
they
should
deliver
but
their
own
souls
by
their
righteousness,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
014:015
If
I
cause
noisome
beasts
to
pass
through
the
land,
and
they
spoil
it,
so
that
it
be
desolate,
that
no
man
may
pass
through
because
of
the
beasts:
014:016
Though
these
three
men
were
in
it,
as
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
they
shall
deliver
neither
sons
nor
daughters;
they
only
shall
be
delivered,
but
the
land
shall
be
desolate.
014:017
Or
if
I
bring
a
sword
upon
that
land,
and
say,
Sword,
go
through
the
land;
so
that
I
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it:
014:018
Though
these
three
men
were
in
it,
as
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
they
shall
deliver
neither
sons
nor
daughters,
but
they
only
shall
be
delivered
themselves.
014:019
Or
if
I
send
a
pestilence
into
that
land,
and
pour
out
my
fury
upon
it
in
blood,
to
cut
off
from
it
man
and
beast:
014:020
Though
Noah,
Daniel,
and
Job
were
in
it,
as
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
they
shall
deliver
neither
son
nor
daughter;
they
shall
but
deliver
their
own
souls
by
their
righteousness.
014:021
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
How
much
more
when
I
send
my
four
sore
judgments
upon
Jerusalem,
the
sword,
and
the
famine,
and
the
noisome
beast,
and
the
pestilence,
to
cut
off
from
it
man
and
beast?
014:022
Yet,
behold,
therein
shall
be
left
a
remnant
that
shall
be
brought
forth,
both
sons
and
daughters:
behold,
they
shall
come
forth
unto
you,
and
ye
shall
see
their
way
and
their
doings:
and
ye
shall
be
comforted
concerning
the
evil
that
I
have
brought
upon
Jerusalem,
even
concerning
all
that
I
have
brought
upon
it.
014:023
And
they
shall
comfort
you,
when
ye
see
their
ways
and
their
doings:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
have
not
done
without
cause
all
that
I
have
done
in
it,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
015:001
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
015:002
Son
of
man,
what
is
the
vine
tree
more
than
any
tree,
or
than
a
branch
which
is
among
the
trees
of
the
forest?
015:003
Shall
wood
be
taken
thereof
to
do
any
work?
or
will
men
take
a
pin
of
it
to
hang
any
vessel
thereon?
015:004
Behold,
it
is
cast
into
the
fire
for
fuel;
the
fire
devoureth
both
the
ends
of
it,
and
the
midst
of
it
is
burned.
Is
it
meet
for
any
work?
015:005
Behold,
when
it
was
whole,
it
was
meet
for
no
work:
how
much
less
shall
it
be
meet
yet
for
any
work,
when
the
fire
hath
devoured
it,
and
it
is
burned?
015:006
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
As
the
vine
tree
among
the
trees
of
the
forest,
which
I
have
given
to
the
fire
for
fuel,
so
will
I
give
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem.
015:007
And
I
will
set
my
face
against
them;
they
shall
go
out
from
one
fire,
and
another
fire
shall
devour
them;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
set
my
face
against
them.
015:008
And
I
will
make
the
land
desolate,
because
they
have
committed
a
trespass,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
016:001
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
016:002
Son
of
man,
cause
Jerusalem
to
know
her
abominations,
016:003
And
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
unto
Jerusalem;
Thy
birth
and
thy
nativity
is
of
the
land
of
Canaan;
thy
father
was
an
Amorite,
and
thy
mother
an
Hittite.
016:004
And
as
for
thy
nativity,
in
the
day
thou
wast
born
thy
navel
was
not
cut,
neither
wast
thou
washed
in
water
to
supple
thee;
thou
wast
not
salted
at
all,
nor
swaddled
at
all.
016:005
None
eye
pitied
thee,
to
do
any
of
these
unto
thee,
to
have
compassion
upon
thee;
but
thou
wast
cast
out
in
the
open
field,
to
the
lothing
of
thy
person,
in
the
day
that
thou
wast
born.
016:006
And
when
I
passed
by
thee,
and
saw
thee
polluted
in
thine
own
blood,
I
said
unto
thee
when
thou
wast
in
thy
blood,
Live;
yea,
I
said
unto
thee
when
thou
wast
in
thy
blood,
Live.
016:007
I
have
caused
thee
to
multiply
as
the
bud
of
the
field,
and
thou
hast
increased
and
waxen
great,
and
thou
art
come
to
excellent
ornaments:
thy
breasts
are
fashioned,
and
thine
hair
is
grown,
whereas
thou
wast
naked
and
bare.
016:008
Now
when
I
passed
by
thee,
and
looked
upon
thee,
behold,
thy
time
was
the
time
of
love;
and
I
spread
my
skirt
over
thee,
and
covered
thy
nakedness:
yea,
I
sware
unto
thee,
and
entered
into
a
covenant
with
thee,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
and
thou
becamest
mine.
016:009
Then
washed
I
thee
with
water;
yea,
I
throughly
washed
away
thy
blood
from
thee,
and
I
anointed
thee
with
oil.
016:010
I
clothed
thee
also
with
broidered
work,
and
shod
thee
with
badgers'
skin,
and
I
girded
thee
about
with
fine
linen,
and
I
covered
thee
with
silk.
016:011
I
decked
thee
also
with
ornaments,
and
I
put
bracelets
upon
thy
hands,
and
a
chain
on
thy
neck.
016:012
And
I
put
a
jewel
on
thy
forehead,
and
earrings
in
thine
ears,
and
a
beautiful
crown
upon
thine
head.
016:013
Thus
wast
thou
decked
with
gold
and
silver;
and
thy
raiment
was
of
fine
linen,
and
silk,
and
broidered
work;
thou
didst
eat
fine
flour,
and
honey,
and
oil:
and
thou
wast
exceeding
beautiful,
and
thou
didst
prosper
into
a
kingdom.
016:014
And
thy
renown
went
forth
among
the
heathen
for
thy
beauty:
for
it
was
perfect
through
my
comeliness,
which
I
had
put
upon
thee,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
016:015
But
thou
didst
trust
in
thine
own
beauty,
and
playedst
the
harlot
because
of
thy
renown,
and
pouredst
out
thy
fornications
on
every
one
that
passed
by;
his
it
was.
016:016
And
of
thy
garments
thou
didst
take,
and
deckedst
thy
high
places
with
divers
colours,
and
playedst
the
harlot
thereupon:
the
like
things
shall
not
come,
neither
shall
it
be
so.
016:017
Thou
hast
also
taken
thy
fair
jewels
of
my
gold
and
of
my
silver,
which
I
had
given
thee,
and
madest
to
thyself
images
of
men,
and
didst
commit
whoredom
with
them,
016:018
And
tookest
thy
broidered
garments,
and
coveredst
them:
and
thou
hast
set
mine
oil
and
mine
incense
before
them.
016:019
My
meat
also
which
I
gave
thee,
fine
flour,
and
oil,
and
honey,
wherewith
I
fed
thee,
thou
hast
even
set
it
before
them
for
a
sweet
savour:
and
thus
it
was,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
016:020
Moreover
thou
hast
taken
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters,
whom
thou
hast
borne
unto
me,
and
these
hast
thou
sacrificed
unto
them
to
be
devoured.
Is
this
of
thy
whoredoms
a
small
matter,
016:021
That
thou
hast
slain
my
children,
and
delivered
them
to
cause
them
to
pass
through
the
fire
for
them?
016:022
And
in
all
thine
abominations
and
thy
whoredoms
thou
hast
not
remembered
the
days
of
thy
youth,
when
thou
wast
naked
and
bare,
and
wast
polluted
in
thy
blood.
016:023
And
it
came
to
pass
after
all
thy
wickedness,
(woe,
woe
unto
thee!
saith
the
LORD
GOD;)
016:024
That
thou
hast
also
built
unto
thee
an
eminent
place,
and
hast
made
thee
an
high
place
in
every
street.
016:025
Thou
hast
built
thy
high
place
at
every
head
of
the
way,
and
hast
made
thy
beauty
to
be
abhorred,
and
hast
opened
thy
feet
to
every
one
that
passed
by,
and
multiplied
thy
whoredoms.
016:026
Thou
hast
also
committed
fornication
with
the
Egyptians
thy
neighbours,
great
of
flesh;
and
hast
increased
thy
whoredoms,
to
provoke
me
to
anger.
016:027
Behold,
therefore
I
have
stretched
out
my
hand
over
thee,
and
have
diminished
thine
ordinary
food,
and
delivered
thee
unto
the
will
of
them
that
hate
thee,
the
daughters
of
the
Philistines,
which
are
ashamed
of
thy
lewd
way.
016:028
Thou
hast
played
the
whore
also
with
the
Assyrians,
because
thou
wast
unsatiable;
yea,
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
with
them,
and
yet
couldest
not
be
satisfied.
016:029
Thou
hast
moreover
multiplied
thy
fornication
in
the
land
of
Canaan
unto
Chaldea;
and
yet
thou
wast
not
satisfied
therewith.
016:030
How
weak
is
thine
heart,
saith
the
LORD
GOD,
seeing
thou
doest
all
these
things,
the
work
of
an
imperious
whorish
woman;
016:031
In
that
thou
buildest
thine
eminent
place
in
the
head
of
every
way,
and
makest
thine
high
place
in
every
street;
and
hast
not
been
as
an
harlot,
in
that
thou
scornest
hire;
016:032
But
as
a
wife
that
committeth
adultery,
which
taketh
strangers
instead
of
her
husband!
016:033
They
give
gifts
to
all
whores:
but
thou
givest
thy
gifts
to
all
thy
lovers,
and
hirest
them,
that
they
may
come
unto
thee
on
every
side
for
thy
whoredom.
016:034
And
the
contrary
is
in
thee
from
other
women
in
thy
whoredoms,
whereas
none
followeth
thee
to
commit
whoredoms:
and
in
that
thou
givest
a
reward,
and
no
reward
is
given
unto
thee,
therefore
thou
art
contrary.
016:035
Wherefore,
O
harlot,
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD:
016:036
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
thy
filthiness
was
poured
out,
and
thy
nakedness
discovered
through
thy
whoredoms
with
thy
lovers,
and
with
all
the
idols
of
thy
abominations,
and
by
the
blood
of
thy
children,
which
thou
didst
give
unto
them;
016:037
Behold,
therefore
I
will
gather
all
thy
lovers,
with
whom
thou
hast
taken
pleasure,
and
all
them
that
thou
hast
loved,
with
all
them
that
thou
hast
hated;
I
will
even
gather
them
round
about
against
thee,
and
will
discover
thy
nakedness
unto
them,
that
they
may
see
all
thy
nakedness.
016:038
And
I
will
judge
thee,
as
women
that
break
wedlock
and
shed
blood
are
judged;
and
I
will
give
thee
blood
in
fury
and
jealousy.
016:039
And
I
will
also
give
thee
into
their
hand,
and
they
shall
throw
down
thine
eminent
place,
and
shall
break
down
thy
high
places:
they
shall
strip
thee
also
of
thy
clothes,
and
shall
take
thy
fair
jewels,
and
leave
thee
naked
and
bare.
016:040
They
shall
also
bring
up
a
company
against
thee,
and
they
shall
stone
thee
with
stones,
and
thrust
thee
through
with
their
swords.
016:041
And
they
shall
burn
thine
houses
with
fire,
and
execute
judgments
upon
thee
in
the
sight
of
many
women:
and
I
will
cause
thee
to
cease
from
playing
the
harlot,
and
thou
also
shalt
give
no
hire
any
more.
016:042
So
will
I
make
my
fury
toward
thee
to
rest,
and
my
jealousy
shall
depart
from
thee,
and
I
will
be
quiet,
and
will
be
no
more
angry.
016:043
Because
thou
hast
not
remembered
the
days
of
thy
youth,
but
hast
fretted
me
in
all
these
things;
behold,
therefore
I
also
will
recompense
thy
way
upon
thine
head,
saith
the
Lord
GOD:
and
thou
shalt
not
commit
this
lewdness
above
all
thine
abominations.
016:044
Behold,
every
one
that
useth
proverbs
shall
use
this
proverb
against
thee,
saying,
As
is
the
mother,
so
is
her
daughter.
016:045
Thou
art
thy
mother's
daughter,
that
lotheth
her
husband
and
her
children;
and
thou
art
the
sister
of
thy
sisters,
which
lothed
their
husbands
and
their
children:
your
mother
was
an
Hittite,
and
your
father
an
Amorite.
016:046
And
thine
elder
sister
is
Samaria,
she
and
her
daughters
that
dwell
at
thy
left
hand:
and
thy
younger
sister,
that
dwelleth
at
thy
right
hand,
is
Sodom
and
her
daughters.
016:047
Yet
hast
thou
not
walked
after
their
ways,
nor
done
after
their
abominations:
but,
as
if
that
were
a
very
little
thing,
thou
wast
corrupted
more
than
they
in
all
thy
ways.
016:048
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
Sodom
thy
sister
hath
not
done,
she
nor
her
daughters,
as
thou
hast
done,
thou
and
thy
daughters.
016:049
Behold,
this
was
the
iniquity
of
thy
sister
Sodom,
pride,
fulness
of
bread,
and
abundance
of
idleness
was
in
her
and
in
her
daughters,
neither
did
she
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
poor
and
needy.
016:050
And
they
were
haughty,
and
committed
abomination
before
me:
therefore
I
took
them
away
as
I
saw
good.
016:051
Neither
hath
Samaria
committed
half
of
thy
sins;
but
thou
hast
multiplied
thine
abominations
more
than
they,
and
hast
justified
thy
sisters
in
all
thine
abominations
which
thou
hast
done.
016:052
Thou
also,
which
hast
judged
thy
sisters,
bear
thine
own
shame
for
thy
sins
that
thou
hast
committed
more
abominable
than
they:
they
are
more
righteous
than
thou:
yea,
be
thou
confounded
also,
and
bear
thy
shame,
in
that
thou
hast
justified
thy
sisters.
016:053
When
I
shall
bring
again
their
captivity,
the
captivity
of
Sodom
and
her
daughters,
and
the
captivity
of
Samaria
and
her
daughters,
then
will
I
bring
again
the
captivity
of
thy
captives
in
the
midst
of
them:
016:054
That
thou
mayest
bear
thine
own
shame,
and
mayest
be
confounded
in
all
that
thou
hast
done,
in
that
thou
art
a
comfort
unto
them.
016:055
When
thy
sisters,
Sodom
and
her
daughters,
shall
return
to
their
former
estate,
and
Samaria
and
her
daughters
shall
return
to
their
former
estate,
then
thou
and
thy
daughters
shall
return
to
your
former
estate.
016:056
For
thy
sister
Sodom
was
not
mentioned
by
thy
mouth
in
the
day
of
thy
pride,
016:057
Before
thy
wickedness
was
discovered,
as
at
the
time
of
thy
reproach
of
the
daughters
of
Syria,
and
all
that
are
round
about
her,
the
daughters
of
the
Philistines,
which
despise
thee
round
about.
016:058
Thou
hast
borne
thy
lewdness
and
thine
abominations,
saith
the
LORD.
016:059
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
even
deal
with
thee
as
thou
hast
done,
which
hast
despised
the
oath
in
breaking
the
covenant.
016:060
Nevertheless
I
will
remember
my
covenant
with
thee
in
the
days
of
thy
youth,
and
I
will
establish
unto
thee
an
everlasting
covenant.
016:061
Then
thou
shalt
remember
thy
ways,
and
be
ashamed,
when
thou
shalt
receive
thy
sisters,
thine
elder
and
thy
younger:
and
I
will
give
them
unto
thee
for
daughters,
but
not
by
thy
covenant.
016:062
And
I
will
establish
my
covenant
with
thee;
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
LORD:
016:063
That
thou
mayest
remember,
and
be
confounded,
and
never
open
thy
mouth
any
more
because
of
thy
shame,
when
I
am
pacified
toward
thee
for
all
that
thou
hast
done,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
017:001
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
017:002
Son
of
man,
put
forth
a
riddle,
and
speak
a
parable
unto
the
house
of
Israel;
017:003
And
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
A
great
eagle
with
great
wings,
longwinged,
full
of
feathers,
which
had
divers
colours,
came
unto
Lebanon,
and
took
the
highest
branch
of
the
cedar:
017:004
He
cropped
off
the
top
of
his
young
twigs,
and
carried
it
into
a
land
of
traffick;
he
set
it
in
a
city
of
merchants.
017:005
He
took
also
of
the
seed
of
the
land,
and
planted
it
in
a
fruitful
field;
he
placed
it
by
great
waters,
and
set
it
as
a
willow
tree.
017:006
And
it
grew,
and
became
a
spreading
vine
of
low
stature,
whose
branches
turned
toward
him,
and
the
roots
thereof
were
under
him:
so
it
became
a
vine,
and
brought
forth
branches,
and
shot
forth
sprigs.
017:007
There
was
also
another
great
eagle
with
great
wings
and
many
feathers:
and,
behold,
this
vine
did
bend
her
roots
toward
him,
and
shot
forth
her
branches
toward
him,
that
he
might
water
it
by
the
furrows
of
her
plantation.
017:008
It
was
planted
in
a
good
soil
by
great
waters,
that
it
might
bring
forth
branches,
and
that
it
might
bear
fruit,
that
it
might
be
a
goodly
vine.
017:009
Say
thou,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Shall
it
prosper?
shall
he
not
pull
up
the
roots
thereof,
and
cut
off
the
fruit
thereof,
that
it
wither?
it
shall
wither
in
all
the
leaves
of
her
spring,
even
without
great
power
or
many
people
to
pluck
it
up
by
the
roots
thereof.
017:010
Yea,
behold,
being
planted,
shall
it
prosper?
shall
it
not
utterly
wither,
when
the
east
wind
toucheth
it?
it
shall
wither
in
the
furrows
where
it
grew.
017:011
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
017:012
Say
now
to
the
rebellious
house,
Know
ye
not
what
these
things
mean?
tell
them,
Behold,
the
king
of
Babylon
is
come
to
Jerusalem,
and
hath
taken
the
king
thereof,
and
the
princes
thereof,
and
led
them
with
him
to
Babylon;
017:013
And
hath
taken
of
the
king's
seed,
and
made
a
covenant
with
him,
and
hath
taken
an
oath
of
him:
he
hath
also
taken
the
mighty
of
the
land:
017:014
That
the
kingdom
might
be
base,
that
it
might
not
lift
itself
up,
but
that
by
keeping
of
his
covenant
it
might
stand.
017:015
But
he
rebelled
against
him
in
sending
his
ambassadors
into
Egypt,
that
they
might
give
him
horses
and
much
people.
Shall
he
prosper?
shall
he
escape
that
doeth
such
things?
or
shall
he
break
the
covenant,
and
be
delivered?
017:016
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
surely
in
the
place
where
the
king
dwelleth
that
made
him
king,
whose
oath
he
despised,
and
whose
covenant
he
brake,
even
with
him
in
the
midst
of
Babylon
he
shall
die.
017:017
Neither
shall
Pharaoh
with
his
mighty
army
and
great
company
make
for
him
in
the
war,
by
casting
up
mounts,
and
building
forts,
to
cut
off
many
persons:
017:018
Seeing
he
despised
the
oath
by
breaking
the
covenant,
when,
lo,
he
had
given
his
hand,
and
hath
done
all
these
things,
he
shall
not
escape.
017:019
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
As
I
live,
surely
mine
oath
that
he
hath
despised,
and
my
covenant
that
he
hath
broken,
even
it
will
I
recompense
upon
his
own
head.
017:020
And
I
will
spread
my
net
upon
him,
and
he
shall
be
taken
in
my
snare,
and
I
will
bring
him
to
Babylon,
and
will
plead
with
him
there
for
his
trespass
that
he
hath
trespassed
against
me.
017:021
And
all
his
fugitives
with
all
his
bands
shall
fall
by
the
sword,
and
they
that
remain
shall
be
scattered
toward
all
winds:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it.
017:022
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
also
take
of
the
highest
branch
of
the
high
cedar,
and
will
set
it;
I
will
crop
off
from
the
top
of
his
young
twigs
a
tender
one,
and
will
plant
it
upon
an
high
mountain
and
eminent:
017:023
In
the
mountain
of
the
height
of
Israel
will
I
plant
it:
and
it
shall
bring
forth
boughs,
and
bear
fruit,
and
be
a
goodly
cedar:
and
under
it
shall
dwell
all
fowl
of
every
wing;
in
the
shadow
of
the
branches
thereof
shall
they
dwell.
017:024
And
all
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
know
that
I
the
LORD
have
brought
down
the
high
tree,
have
exalted
the
low
tree,
have
dried
up
the
green
tree,
and
have
made
the
dry
tree
to
flourish:
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
and
have
done
it.
018:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me
again,
saying,
018:002
What
mean
ye,
that
ye
use
this
proverb
concerning
the
land
of
Israel,
saying,
The
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes,
and
the
children's
teeth
are
set
on
edge?
018:003
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
ye
shall
not
have
occasion
any
more
to
use
this
proverb
in
Israel.
018:004
Behold,
all
souls
are
mine;
as
the
soul
of
the
father,
so
also
the
soul
of
the
son
is
mine:
the
soul
that
sinneth,
it
shall
die.
018:005
But
if
a
man
be
just,
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right,
018:006
And
hath
not
eaten
upon
the
mountains,
neither
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols
of
the
house
of
Israel,
neither
hath
defiled
his
neighbour's
wife,
neither
hath
come
near
to
a
menstruous
woman,
018:007
And
hath
not
oppressed
any,
but
hath
restored
to
the
debtor
his
pledge,
hath
spoiled
none
by
violence,
hath
given
his
bread
to
the
hungry,
and
hath
covered
the
naked
with
a
garment;
018:008
He
that
hath
not
given
forth
upon
usury,
neither
hath
taken
any
increase,
that
hath
withdrawn
his
hand
from
iniquity,
hath
executed
true
judgment
between
man
and
man,
018:009
Hath
walked
in
my
statutes,
and
hath
kept
my
judgments,
to
deal
truly;
he
is
just,
he
shall
surely
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
018:010
If
he
beget
a
son
that
is
a
robber,
