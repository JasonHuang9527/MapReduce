a
shedder
of
blood,
and
that
doeth
the
like
to
any
one
of
these
things,
018:011
And
that
doeth
not
any
of
those
duties,
but
even
hath
eaten
upon
the
mountains,
and
defiled
his
neighbour's
wife,
018:012
Hath
oppressed
the
poor
and
needy,
hath
spoiled
by
violence,
hath
not
restored
the
pledge,
and
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols,
hath
committed
abomination,
018:013
Hath
given
forth
upon
usury,
and
hath
taken
increase:
shall
he
then
live?
he
shall
not
live:
he
hath
done
all
these
abominations;
he
shall
surely
die;
his
blood
shall
be
upon
him.
018:014
Now,
lo,
if
he
beget
a
son,
that
seeth
all
his
father's
sins
which
he
hath
done,
and
considereth,
and
doeth
not
such
like,
018:015
That
hath
not
eaten
upon
the
mountains,
neither
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols
of
the
house
of
Israel,
hath
not
defiled
his
neighbour's
wife,
018:016
Neither
hath
oppressed
any,
hath
not
withholden
the
pledge,
neither
hath
spoiled
by
violence,
but
hath
given
his
bread
to
the
hungry,
and
hath
covered
the
naked
with
a
garment,
018:017
That
hath
taken
off
his
hand
from
the
poor,
that
hath
not
received
usury
nor
increase,
hath
executed
my
judgments,
hath
walked
in
my
statutes;
he
shall
not
die
for
the
iniquity
of
his
father,
he
shall
surely
live.
018:018
As
for
his
father,
because
he
cruelly
oppressed,
spoiled
his
brother
by
violence,
and
did
that
which
is
not
good
among
his
people,
lo,
even
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity.
018:019
Yet
say
ye,
Why?
doth
not
the
son
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
father?
When
the
son
hath
done
that
which
is
lawful
and
right,
and
hath
kept
all
my
statutes,
and
hath
done
them,
he
shall
surely
live.
018:020
The
soul
that
sinneth,
it
shall
die.
The
son
shall
not
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
father,
neither
shall
the
father
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
son:
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
shall
be
upon
him,
and
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
shall
be
upon
him.
018:021
But
if
the
wicked
will
turn
from
all
his
sins
that
he
hath
committed,
and
keep
all
my
statutes,
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right,
he
shall
surely
live,
he
shall
not
die.
018:022
All
his
transgressions
that
he
hath
committed,
they
shall
not
be
mentioned
unto
him:
in
his
righteousness
that
he
hath
done
he
shall
live.
018:023
Have
I
any
pleasure
at
all
that
the
wicked
should
die?
saith
the
Lord
GOD:
and
not
that
he
should
return
from
his
ways,
and
live?
018:024
But
when
the
righteous
turneth
away
from
his
righteousness,
and
committeth
iniquity,
and
doeth
according
to
all
the
abominations
that
the
wicked
man
doeth,
shall
he
live?
All
his
righteousness
that
he
hath
done
shall
not
be
mentioned:
in
his
trespass
that
he
hath
trespassed,
and
in
his
sin
that
he
hath
sinned,
in
them
shall
he
die.
018:025
Yet
ye
say,
The
way
of
the
LORD
is
not
equal.
Hear
now,
O
house
of
Israel;
Is
not
my
way
equal?
are
not
your
ways
unequal?
018:026
When
a
righteous
man
turneth
away
from
his
righteousness,
and
committeth
iniquity,
and
dieth
in
them;
for
his
iniquity
that
he
hath
done
shall
he
die.
018:027
Again,
when
the
wicked
man
turneth
away
from
his
wickedness
that
he
hath
committed,
and
doeth
that
which
is
lawful
and
right,
he
shall
save
his
soul
alive.
018:028
Because
he
considereth,
and
turneth
away
from
all
his
transgressions
that
he
hath
committed,
he
shall
surely
live,
he
shall
not
die.
018:029
Yet
saith
the
house
of
Israel,
The
way
of
the
LORD
is
not
equal.
O
house
of
Israel,
are
not
my
ways
equal?
are
not
your
ways
unequal?
018:030
Therefore
I
will
judge
you,
O
house
of
Israel,
every
one
according
to
his
ways,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
Repent,
and
turn
yourselves
from
all
your
transgressions;
so
iniquity
shall
not
be
your
ruin.
018:031
Cast
away
from
you
all
your
transgressions,
whereby
ye
have
transgressed;
and
make
you
a
new
heart
and
a
new
spirit:
for
why
will
ye
die,
O
house
of
Israel?
018:032
For
I
have
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
him
that
dieth,
saith
the
Lord
GOD:
wherefore
turn
yourselves,
and
live
ye.
019:001
Moreover
take
thou
up
a
lamentation
for
the
princes
of
Israel,
019:002
And
say,
What
is
thy
mother?
A
lioness:
she
lay
down
among
lions,
she
nourished
her
whelps
among
young
lions.
019:003
And
she
brought
up
one
of
her
whelps:
it
became
a
young
lion,
and
it
learned
to
catch
the
prey;
it
devoured
men.
019:004
The
nations
also
heard
of
him;
he
was
taken
in
their
pit,
and
they
brought
him
with
chains
unto
the
land
of
Egypt.
019:005
Now
when
she
saw
that
she
had
waited,
and
her
hope
was
lost,
then
she
took
another
of
her
whelps,
and
made
him
a
young
lion.
019:006
And
he
went
up
and
down
among
the
lions,
he
became
a
young
lion,
and
learned
to
catch
the
prey,
and
devoured
men.
019:007
And
he
knew
their
desolate
palaces,
and
he
laid
waste
their
cities;
and
the
land
was
desolate,
and
the
fulness
thereof,
by
the
noise
of
his
roaring.
019:008
Then
the
nations
set
against
him
on
every
side
from
the
provinces,
and
spread
their
net
over
him:
he
was
taken
in
their
pit.
019:009
And
they
put
him
in
ward
in
chains,
and
brought
him
to
the
king
of
Babylon:
they
brought
him
into
holds,
that
his
voice
should
no
more
be
heard
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel.
019:010
Thy
mother
is
like
a
vine
in
thy
blood,
planted
by
the
waters:
she
was
fruitful
and
full
of
branches
by
reason
of
many
waters.
019:011
And
she
had
strong
rods
for
the
sceptres
of
them
that
bare
rule,
and
her
stature
was
exalted
among
the
thick
branches,
and
she
appeared
in
her
height
with
the
multitude
of
her
branches.
019:012
But
she
was
plucked
up
in
fury,
she
was
cast
down
to
the
ground,
and
the
east
wind
dried
up
her
fruit:
her
strong
rods
were
broken
and
withered;
the
fire
consumed
them.
019:013
And
now
she
is
planted
in
the
wilderness,
in
a
dry
and
thirsty
ground.
019:014
And
fire
is
gone
out
of
a
rod
of
her
branches,
which
hath
devoured
her
fruit,
so
that
she
hath
no
strong
rod
to
be
a
sceptre
to
rule.
This
is
a
lamentation,
and
shall
be
for
a
lamentation.
020:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
year,
in
the
fifth
month,
the
tenth
day
of
the
month,
that
certain
of
the
elders
of
Israel
came
to
enquire
of
the
LORD,
and
sat
before
me.
020:002
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
me,
saying,
020:003
Son
of
man,
speak
unto
the
elders
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Are
ye
come
to
enquire
of
me?
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
I
will
not
be
enquired
of
by
you.
020:004
Wilt
thou
judge
them,
son
of
man,
wilt
thou
judge
them?
cause
them
to
know
the
abominations
of
their
fathers:
020:005
And
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
In
the
day
when
I
chose
Israel,
and
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
the
seed
of
the
house
of
Jacob,
and
made
myself
known
unto
them
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
when
I
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them,
saying,
I
am
the
LORD
your
God;
020:006
In
the
day
that
I
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them,
to
bring
them
forth
of
the
land
of
Egypt
into
a
land
that
I
had
espied
for
them,
flowing
with
milk
and
honey,
which
is
the
glory
of
all
lands:
020:007
Then
said
I
unto
them,
Cast
ye
away
every
man
the
abominations
of
his
eyes,
and
defile
not
yourselves
with
the
idols
of
Egypt:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
020:008
But
they
rebelled
against
me,
and
would
not
hearken
unto
me:
they
did
not
every
man
cast
away
the
abominations
of
their
eyes,
neither
did
they
forsake
the
idols
of
Egypt:
then
I
said,
I
will
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them,
to
accomplish
my
anger
against
them
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
020:009
But
I
wrought
for
my
name's
sake,
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
before
the
heathen,
among
whom
they
were,
in
whose
sight
I
made
myself
known
unto
them,
in
bringing
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
020:010
Wherefore
I
caused
them
to
go
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
brought
them
into
the
wilderness.
020:011
And
I
gave
them
my
statutes,
and
shewed
them
my
judgments,
which
if
a
man
do,
he
shall
even
live
in
them.
020:012
Moreover
also
I
gave
them
my
sabbaths,
to
be
a
sign
between
me
and
them,
that
they
might
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
that
sanctify
them.
020:013
But
the
house
of
Israel
rebelled
against
me
in
the
wilderness:
they
walked
not
in
my
statutes,
and
they
despised
my
judgments,
which
if
a
man
do,
he
shall
even
live
in
them;
and
my
sabbaths
they
greatly
polluted:
then
I
said,
I
would
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them
in
the
wilderness,
to
consume
them.
020:014
But
I
wrought
for
my
name's
sake,
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
before
the
heathen,
in
whose
sight
I
brought
them
out.
020:015
Yet
also
I
lifted
up
my
hand
unto
them
in
the
wilderness,
that
I
would
not
bring
them
into
the
land
which
I
had
given
them,
flowing
with
milk
and
honey,
which
is
the
glory
of
all
lands;
020:016
Because
they
despised
my
judgments,
and
walked
not
in
my
statutes,
but
polluted
my
sabbaths:
for
their
heart
went
after
their
idols.
020:017
Nevertheless
mine
eye
spared
them
from
destroying
them,
neither
did
I
make
an
end
of
them
in
the
wilderness.
020:018
But
I
said
unto
their
children
in
the
wilderness,
Walk
ye
not
in
the
statutes
of
your
fathers,
neither
observe
their
judgments,
nor
defile
yourselves
with
their
idols:
020:019
I
am
the
LORD
your
God;
walk
in
my
statutes,
and
keep
my
judgments,
and
do
them;
020:020
And
hallow
my
sabbaths;
and
they
shall
be
a
sign
between
me
and
you,
that
ye
may
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
020:021
Notwithstanding
the
children
rebelled
against
me:
they
walked
not
in
my
statutes,
neither
kept
my
judgments
to
do
them,
which
if
a
man
do,
he
shall
even
live
in
them;
they
polluted
my
sabbaths:
then
I
said,
I
would
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them,
to
accomplish
my
anger
against
them
in
the
wilderness.
020:022
Nevertheless
I
withdrew
mine
hand,
and
wrought
for
my
name's
sake,
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen,
in
whose
sight
I
brought
them
forth.
020:023
I
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them
also
in
the
wilderness,
that
I
would
scatter
them
among
the
heathen,
and
disperse
them
through
the
countries;
020:024
Because
they
had
not
executed
my
judgments,
but
had
despised
my
statutes,
and
had
polluted
my
sabbaths,
and
their
eyes
were
after
their
fathers'
idols.
020:025
Wherefore
I
gave
them
also
statutes
that
were
not
good,
and
judgments
whereby
they
should
not
live;
020:026
And
I
polluted
them
in
their
own
gifts,
in
that
they
caused
to
pass
through
the
fire
all
that
openeth
the
womb,
that
I
might
make
them
desolate,
to
the
end
that
they
might
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
020:027
Therefore,
son
of
man,
speak
unto
the
house
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Yet
in
this
your
fathers
have
blasphemed
me,
in
that
they
have
committed
a
trespass
against
me.
020:028
For
when
I
had
brought
them
into
the
land,
for
the
which
I
lifted
up
mine
hand
to
give
it
to
them,
then
they
saw
every
high
hill,
and
all
the
thick
trees,
and
they
offered
there
their
sacrifices,
and
there
they
presented
the
provocation
of
their
offering:
there
also
they
made
their
sweet
savour,
and
poured
out
there
their
drink
offerings.
020:029
Then
I
said
unto
them,
What
is
the
high
place
whereunto
ye
go?
And
the
name
whereof
is
called
Bamah
unto
this
day.
020:030
Wherefore
say
unto
the
house
of
Israel,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Are
ye
polluted
after
the
manner
of
your
fathers?
and
commit
ye
whoredom
after
their
abominations?
020:031
For
when
ye
offer
your
gifts,
when
ye
make
your
sons
to
pass
through
the
fire,
ye
pollute
yourselves
with
all
your
idols,
even
unto
this
day:
and
shall
I
be
enquired
of
by
you,
O
house
of
Israel?
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
I
will
not
be
enquired
of
by
you.
020:032
And
that
which
cometh
into
your
mind
shall
not
be
at
all,
that
ye
say,
We
will
be
as
the
heathen,
as
the
families
of
the
countries,
to
serve
wood
and
stone.
020:033
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
surely
with
a
mighty
hand,
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm,
and
with
fury
poured
out,
will
I
rule
over
you:
020:034
And
I
will
bring
you
out
from
the
people,
and
will
gather
you
out
of
the
countries
wherein
ye
are
scattered,
with
a
mighty
hand,
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm,
and
with
fury
poured
out.
020:035
And
I
will
bring
you
into
the
wilderness
of
the
people,
and
there
will
I
plead
with
you
face
to
face.
020:036
Like
as
I
pleaded
with
your
fathers
in
the
wilderness
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
so
will
I
plead
with
you,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
020:037
And
I
will
cause
you
to
pass
under
the
rod,
and
I
will
bring
you
into
the
bond
of
the
covenant:
020:038
And
I
will
purge
out
from
among
you
the
rebels,
and
them
that
transgress
against
me:
I
will
bring
them
forth
out
of
the
country
where
they
sojourn,
and
they
shall
not
enter
into
the
land
of
Israel:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
020:039
As
for
you,
O
house
of
Israel,
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Go
ye,
serve
ye
every
one
his
idols,
and
hereafter
also,
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
me:
but
pollute
ye
my
holy
name
no
more
with
your
gifts,
and
with
your
idols.
020:040
For
in
mine
holy
mountain,
in
the
mountain
of
the
height
of
Israel,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
there
shall
all
the
house
of
Israel,
all
of
them
in
the
land,
serve
me:
there
will
I
accept
them,
and
there
will
I
require
your
offerings,
and
the
firstfruits
of
your
oblations,
with
all
your
holy
things.
020:041
I
will
accept
you
with
your
sweet
savour,
when
I
bring
you
out
from
the
people,
and
gather
you
out
of
the
countries
wherein
ye
have
been
scattered;
and
I
will
be
sanctified
in
you
before
the
heathen.
020:042
And
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
shall
bring
you
into
the
land
of
Israel,
into
the
country
for
the
which
I
lifted
up
mine
hand
to
give
it
to
your
fathers.
020:043
And
there
shall
ye
remember
your
ways,
and
all
your
doings,
wherein
ye
have
been
defiled;
and
ye
shall
lothe
yourselves
in
your
own
sight
for
all
your
evils
that
ye
have
committed.
020:044
And
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
when
I
have
wrought
with
you
for
my
name's
sake,
not
according
to
your
wicked
ways,
nor
according
to
your
corrupt
doings,
O
ye
house
of
Israel,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
020:045
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
020:046
Son
of
man,
set
thy
face
toward
the
south,
and
drop
thy
word
toward
the
south,
and
prophesy
against
the
forest
of
the
south
field;
020:047
And
say
to
the
forest
of
the
south,
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD;
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
kindle
a
fire
in
thee,
and
it
shall
devour
every
green
tree
in
thee,
and
every
dry
tree:
the
flaming
flame
shall
not
be
quenched,
and
all
faces
from
the
south
to
the
north
shall
be
burned
therein.
020:048
And
all
flesh
shall
see
that
I
the
LORD
have
kindled
it:
it
shall
not
be
quenched.
020:049
Then
said
I,
Ah
Lord
GOD!
they
say
of
me,
Doth
he
not
speak
parables?
021:001
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
021:002
Son
of
man,
set
thy
face
toward
Jerusalem,
and
drop
thy
word
toward
the
holy
places,
and
prophesy
against
the
land
of
Israel,
021:003
And
say
to
the
land
of
Israel,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
and
will
draw
forth
my
sword
out
of
his
sheath,
and
will
cut
off
from
thee
the
righteous
and
the
wicked.
021:004
Seeing
then
that
I
will
cut
off
from
thee
the
righteous
and
the
wicked,
therefore
shall
my
sword
go
forth
out
of
his
sheath
against
all
flesh
from
the
south
to
the
north:
021:005
That
all
flesh
may
know
that
I
the
LORD
have
drawn
forth
my
sword
out
of
his
sheath:
it
shall
not
return
any
more.
021:006
Sigh
therefore,
thou
son
of
man,
with
the
breaking
of
thy
loins;
and
with
bitterness
sigh
before
their
eyes.
021:007
And
it
shall
be,
when
they
say
unto
thee,
Wherefore
sighest
thou?
that
thou
shalt
answer,
For
the
tidings;
because
it
cometh:
and
every
heart
shall
melt,
and
all
hands
shall
be
feeble,
and
every
spirit
shall
faint,
and
all
knees
shall
be
weak
as
water:
behold,
it
cometh,
and
shall
be
brought
to
pass,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
021:008
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
021:009
Son
of
man,
prophesy,
and
say,
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Say,
A
sword,
a
sword
is
sharpened,
and
also
furbished:
021:010
It
is
sharpened
to
make
a
sore
slaughter;
it
is
furbished
that
it
may
glitter:
should
we
then
make
mirth?
it
contemneth
the
rod
of
my
son,
as
every
tree.
021:011
And
he
hath
given
it
to
be
furbished,
that
it
may
be
handled:
this
sword
is
sharpened,
and
it
is
furbished,
to
give
it
into
the
hand
of
the
slayer.
021:012
Cry
and
howl,
son
of
man:
for
it
shall
be
upon
my
people,
it
shall
be
upon
all
the
princes
of
Israel:
terrors
by
reason
of
the
sword
shall
be
upon
my
people:
smite
therefore
upon
thy
thigh.
021:013
Because
it
is
a
trial,
and
what
if
the
sword
contemn
even
the
rod?
it
shall
be
no
more,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
021:014
Thou
therefore,
son
of
man,
prophesy,
and
smite
thine
hands
together.
and
let
the
sword
be
doubled
the
third
time,
the
sword
of
the
slain:
it
is
the
sword
of
the
great
men
that
are
slain,
which
entereth
into
their
privy
chambers.
021:015
I
have
set
the
point
of
the
sword
against
all
their
gates,
that
their
heart
may
faint,
and
their
ruins
be
multiplied:
ah!
it
is
made
bright,
it
is
wrapped
up
for
the
slaughter.
021:016
Go
thee
one
way
or
other,
either
on
the
right
hand,
or
on
the
left,
whithersoever
thy
face
is
set.
021:017
I
will
also
smite
mine
hands
together,
and
I
will
cause
my
fury
to
rest:
I
the
LORD
have
said
it.
021:018
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me
again,
saying,
021:019
Also,
thou
son
of
man,
appoint
thee
two
ways,
that
the
sword
of
the
king
of
Babylon
may
come:
both
twain
shall
come
forth
out
of
one
land:
and
choose
thou
a
place,
choose
it
at
the
head
of
the
way
to
the
city.
021:020
Appoint
a
way,
that
the
sword
may
come
to
Rabbath
of
the
Ammonites,
and
to
Judah
in
Jerusalem
the
defenced.
021:021
For
the
king
of
Babylon
stood
at
the
parting
of
the
way,
at
the
head
of
the
two
ways,
to
use
divination:
he
made
his
arrows
bright,
he
consulted
with
images,
he
looked
in
the
liver.
021:022
At
his
right
hand
was
the
divination
for
Jerusalem,
to
appoint
captains,
to
open
the
mouth
in
the
slaughter,
to
lift
up
the
voice
with
shouting,
to
appoint
battering
rams
against
the
gates,
to
cast
a
mount,
and
to
build
a
fort.
021:023
And
it
shall
be
unto
them
as
a
false
divination
in
their
sight,
to
them
that
have
sworn
oaths:
but
he
will
call
to
remembrance
the
iniquity,
that
they
may
be
taken.
021:024
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
ye
have
made
your
iniquity
to
be
remembered,
in
that
your
transgressions
are
discovered,
so
that
in
all
your
doings
your
sins
do
appear;
because,
I
say,
that
ye
are
come
to
remembrance,
ye
shall
be
taken
with
the
hand.
021:025
And
thou,
profane
wicked
prince
of
Israel,
whose
day
is
come,
when
iniquity
shall
have
an
end,
021:026
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Remove
the
diadem,
and
take
off
the
crown:
this
shall
not
be
the
same:
exalt
him
that
is
low,
and
abase
him
that
is
high.
021:027
I
will
overturn,
overturn,
overturn,
it:
and
it
shall
be
no
more,
until
he
come
whose
right
it
is;
and
I
will
give
it
him.
021:028
And
thou,
son
of
man,
prophesy
and
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
concerning
the
Ammonites,
and
concerning
their
reproach;
even
say
thou,
The
sword,
the
sword
is
drawn:
for
the
slaughter
it
is
furbished,
to
consume
because
of
the
glittering:
021:029
Whiles
they
see
vanity
unto
thee,
whiles
they
divine
a
lie
unto
thee,
to
bring
thee
upon
the
necks
of
them
that
are
slain,
of
the
wicked,
whose
day
is
come,
when
their
iniquity
shall
have
an
end.
021:030
Shall
I
cause
it
to
return
into
his
sheath?
I
will
judge
thee
in
the
place
where
thou
wast
created,
in
the
land
of
thy
nativity.
021:031
And
I
will
pour
out
mine
indignation
upon
thee,
I
will
blow
against
thee
in
the
fire
of
my
wrath,
and
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
brutish
men,
and
skilful
to
destroy.
021:032
Thou
shalt
be
for
fuel
to
the
fire;
thy
blood
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
the
land;
thou
shalt
be
no
more
remembered:
for
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it.
022:001
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
022:002
Now,
thou
son
of
man,
wilt
thou
judge,
wilt
thou
judge
the
bloody
city?
yea,
thou
shalt
shew
her
all
her
abominations.
022:003
Then
say
thou,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
The
city
sheddeth
blood
in
the
midst
of
it,
that
her
time
may
come,
and
maketh
idols
against
herself
to
defile
herself.
022:004
Thou
art
become
guilty
in
thy
blood
that
thou
hast
shed;
and
hast
defiled
thyself
in
thine
idols
which
thou
hast
made;
and
thou
hast
caused
thy
days
to
draw
near,
and
art
come
even
unto
thy
years:
therefore
have
I
made
thee
a
reproach
unto
the
heathen,
and
a
mocking
to
all
countries.
022:005
Those
that
be
near,
and
those
that
be
far
from
thee,
shall
mock
thee,
which
art
infamous
and
much
vexed.
022:006
Behold,
the
princes
of
Israel,
every
one
were
in
thee
to
their
power
to
shed
blood.
022:007
In
thee
have
they
set
light
by
father
and
mother:
in
the
midst
of
thee
have
they
dealt
by
oppression
with
the
stranger:
in
thee
have
they
vexed
the
fatherless
and
the
widow.
022:008
Thou
hast
despised
mine
holy
things,
and
hast
profaned
my
sabbaths.
022:009
In
thee
are
men
that
carry
tales
to
shed
blood:
and
in
thee
they
eat
upon
the
mountains:
in
the
midst
of
thee
they
commit
lewdness.
022:010
In
thee
have
they
discovered
their
fathers'
nakedness:
in
thee
have
they
humbled
her
that
was
set
apart
for
pollution.
022:011
And
one
hath
committed
abomination
with
his
neighbour's
wife;
and
another
hath
lewdly
defiled
his
daughter
in
law;
and
another
in
thee
hath
humbled
his
sister,
his
father's
daughter.
022:012
In
thee
have
they
taken
gifts
to
shed
blood;
thou
hast
taken
usury
and
increase,
and
thou
hast
greedily
gained
of
thy
neighbours
by
extortion,
and
hast
forgotten
me,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
022:013
Behold,
therefore
I
have
smitten
mine
hand
at
thy
dishonest
gain
which
thou
hast
made,
and
at
thy
blood
which
hath
been
in
the
midst
of
thee.
022:014
Can
thine
heart
endure,
or
can
thine
hands
be
strong,
in
the
days
that
I
shall
deal
with
thee?
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it,
and
will
do
it.
022:015
And
I
will
scatter
thee
among
the
heathen,
and
disperse
thee
