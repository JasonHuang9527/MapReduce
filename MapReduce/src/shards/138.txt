in
the
countries,
and
will
consume
thy
filthiness
out
of
thee.
022:016
And
thou
shalt
take
thine
inheritance
in
thyself
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen,
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
022:017
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
022:018
Son
of
man,
the
house
of
Israel
is
to
me
become
dross:
all
they
are
brass,
and
tin,
and
iron,
and
lead,
in
the
midst
of
the
furnace;
they
are
even
the
dross
of
silver.
022:019
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
ye
are
all
become
dross,
behold,
therefore
I
will
gather
you
into
the
midst
of
Jerusalem.
022:020
As
they
gather
silver,
and
brass,
and
iron,
and
lead,
and
tin,
into
the
midst
of
the
furnace,
to
blow
the
fire
upon
it,
to
melt
it;
so
will
I
gather
you
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
fury,
and
I
will
leave
you
there,
and
melt
you.
022:021
Yea,
I
will
gather
you,
and
blow
upon
you
in
the
fire
of
my
wrath,
and
ye
shall
be
melted
in
the
midst
therof.
022:022
As
silver
is
melted
in
the
midst
of
the
furnace,
so
shall
ye
be
melted
in
the
midst
thereof;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
the
LORD
have
poured
out
my
fury
upon
you.
022:023
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
022:024
Son
of
man,
say
unto
her,
Thou
art
the
land
that
is
not
cleansed,
nor
rained
upon
in
the
day
of
indignation.
022:025
There
is
a
conspiracy
of
her
prophets
in
the
midst
thereof,
like
a
roaring
lion
ravening
the
prey;
they
have
devoured
souls;
they
have
taken
the
treasure
and
precious
things;
they
have
made
her
many
widows
in
the
midst
thereof.
022:026
Her
priests
have
violated
my
law,
and
have
profaned
mine
holy
things:
they
have
put
no
difference
between
the
holy
and
profane,
neither
have
they
shewed
difference
between
the
unclean
and
the
clean,
and
have
hid
their
eyes
from
my
sabbaths,
and
I
am
profaned
among
them.
022:027
Her
princes
in
the
midst
thereof
are
like
wolves
ravening
the
prey,
to
shed
blood,
and
to
destroy
souls,
to
get
dishonest
gain.
022:028
And
her
prophets
have
daubed
them
with
untempered
morter,
seeing
vanity,
and
divining
lies
unto
them,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
when
the
LORD
hath
not
spoken.
022:029
The
people
of
the
land
have
used
oppression,
and
exercised
robbery,
and
have
vexed
the
poor
and
needy:
yea,
they
have
oppressed
the
stranger
wrongfully.
022:030
And
I
sought
for
a
man
among
them,
that
should
make
up
the
hedge,
and
stand
in
the
gap
before
me
for
the
land,
that
I
should
not
destroy
it:
but
I
found
none.
022:031
Therefore
have
I
poured
out
mine
indignation
upon
them;
I
have
consumed
them
with
the
fire
of
my
wrath:
their
own
way
have
I
recompensed
upon
their
heads,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
023:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
unto
me,
saying,
023:002
Son
of
man,
there
were
two
women,
the
daughters
of
one
mother:
023:003
And
they
committed
whoredoms
in
Egypt;
they
committed
whoredoms
in
their
youth:
there
were
their
breasts
pressed,
and
there
they
bruised
the
teats
of
their
virginity.
023:004
And
the
names
of
them
were
Aholah
the
elder,
and
Aholibah
her
sister:
and
they
were
mine,
and
they
bare
sons
and
daughters.
Thus
were
their
names;
Samaria
is
Aholah,
and
Jerusalem
Aholibah.
023:005
And
Aholah
played
the
harlot
when
she
was
mine;
and
she
doted
on
her
lovers,
on
the
Assyrians
her
neighbours,
023:006
Which
were
clothed
with
blue,
captains
and
rulers,
all
of
them
desirable
young
men,
horsemen
riding
upon
horses.
023:007
Thus
she
committed
her
whoredoms
with
them,
with
all
them
that
were
the
chosen
men
of
Assyria,
and
with
all
on
whom
she
doted:
with
all
their
idols
she
defiled
herself.
023:008
Neither
left
she
her
whoredoms
brought
from
Egypt:
for
in
her
youth
they
lay
with
her,
and
they
bruised
the
breasts
of
her
virginity,
and
poured
their
whoredom
upon
her.
023:009
Wherefore
I
have
delivered
her
into
the
hand
of
her
lovers,
into
the
hand
of
the
Assyrians,
upon
whom
she
doted.
023:010
These
discovered
her
nakedness:
they
took
her
sons
and
her
daughters,
and
slew
her
with
the
sword:
and
she
became
famous
among
women;
for
they
had
executed
judgment
upon
her.
023:011
And
when
her
sister
Aholibah
saw
this,
she
was
more
corrupt
in
her
inordinate
love
than
she,
and
in
her
whoredoms
more
than
her
sister
in
her
whoredoms.
023:012
She
doted
upon
the
Assyrians
her
neighbours,
captains
and
rulers
clothed
most
gorgeously,
horsemen
riding
upon
horses,
all
of
them
desirable
young
men.
023:013
Then
I
saw
that
she
was
defiled,
that
they
took
both
one
way,
023:014
And
that
she
increased
her
whoredoms:
for
when
she
saw
men
pourtrayed
upon
the
wall,
the
images
of
the
Chaldeans
pourtrayed
with
vermilion,
023:015
Girded
with
girdles
upon
their
loins,
exceeding
in
dyed
attire
upon
their
heads,
all
of
them
princes
to
look
to,
after
the
manner
of
the
Babylonians
of
Chaldea,
the
land
of
their
nativity:
023:016
And
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
with
her
eyes,
she
doted
upon
them,
and
sent
messengers
unto
them
into
Chaldea.
023:017
And
the
Babylonians
came
to
her
into
the
bed
of
love,
and
they
defiled
her
with
their
whoredom,
and
she
was
polluted
with
them,
and
her
mind
was
alienated
from
them.
023:018
So
she
discovered
her
whoredoms,
and
discovered
her
nakedness:
then
my
mind
was
alienated
from
her,
like
as
my
mind
was
alienated
from
her
sister.
023:019
Yet
she
multiplied
her
whoredoms,
in
calling
to
remembrance
the
days
of
her
youth,
wherein
she
had
played
the
harlot
in
the
land
of
Egypt.
023:020
For
she
doted
upon
their
paramours,
whose
flesh
is
as
the
flesh
of
asses,
and
whose
issue
is
like
the
issue
of
horses.
023:021
Thus
thou
calledst
to
remembrance
the
lewdness
of
thy
youth,
in
bruising
thy
teats
by
the
Egyptians
for
the
paps
of
thy
youth.
023:022
Therefore,
O
Aholibah,
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
raise
up
thy
lovers
against
thee,
from
whom
thy
mind
is
alienated,
and
I
will
bring
them
against
thee
on
every
side;
023:023
The
Babylonians,
and
all
the
Chaldeans,
Pekod,
and
Shoa,
and
Koa,
and
all
the
Assyrians
with
them:
all
of
them
desirable
young
men,
captains
and
rulers,
great
lords
and
renowned,
all
of
them
riding
upon
horses.
023:024
And
they
shall
come
against
thee
with
chariots,
wagons,
and
wheels,
and
with
an
assembly
of
people,
which
shall
set
against
thee
buckler
and
shield
and
helmet
round
about:
and
I
will
set
judgment
before
them,
and
they
shall
judge
thee
according
to
their
judgments.
023:025
And
I
will
set
my
jealousy
against
thee,
and
they
shall
deal
furiously
with
thee:
they
shall
take
away
thy
nose
and
thine
ears;
and
thy
remnant
shall
fall
by
the
sword:
they
shall
take
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters;
and
thy
residue
shall
be
devoured
by
the
fire.
023:026
They
shall
also
strip
thee
out
of
thy
clothes,
and
take
away
thy
fair
jewels.
023:027
Thus
will
I
make
thy
lewdness
to
cease
from
thee,
and
thy
whoredom
brought
from
the
land
of
Egypt:
so
that
thou
shalt
not
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
them,
nor
remember
Egypt
any
more.
023:028
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
them
whom
thou
hatest,
into
the
hand
of
them
from
whom
thy
mind
is
alienated:
023:029
And
they
shall
deal
with
thee
hatefully,
and
shall
take
away
all
thy
labour,
and
shall
leave
thee
naked
and
bare:
and
the
nakedness
of
thy
whoredoms
shall
be
discovered,
both
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms.
023:030
I
will
do
these
things
unto
thee,
because
thou
hast
gone
a
whoring
after
the
heathen,
and
because
thou
art
polluted
with
their
idols.
023:031
Thou
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
thy
sister;
therefore
will
I
give
her
cup
into
thine
hand.
023:032
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Thou
shalt
drink
of
thy
sister's
cup
deep
and
large:
thou
shalt
be
laughed
to
scorn
and
had
in
derision;
it
containeth
much.
023:033
Thou
shalt
be
filled
with
drunkenness
and
sorrow,
with
the
cup
of
astonishment
and
desolation,
with
the
cup
of
thy
sister
Samaria.
023:034
Thou
shalt
even
drink
it
and
suck
it
out,
and
thou
shalt
break
the
sherds
thereof,
and
pluck
off
thine
own
breasts:
for
I
have
spoken
it,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
023:035
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
thou
hast
forgotten
me,
and
cast
me
behind
thy
back,
therefore
bear
thou
also
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms.
023:036
The
LORD
said
moreover
unto
me;
Son
of
man,
wilt
thou
judge
Aholah
and
Aholibah?
yea,
declare
unto
them
their
abominations;
023:037
That
they
have
committed
adultery,
and
blood
is
in
their
hands,
and
with
their
idols
have
they
committed
adultery,
and
have
also
caused
their
sons,
whom
they
bare
unto
me,
to
pass
for
them
through
the
fire,
to
devour
them.
023:038
Moreover
this
they
have
done
unto
me:
they
have
defiled
my
sanctuary
in
the
same
day,
and
have
profaned
my
sabbaths.
023:039
For
when
they
had
slain
their
children
to
their
idols,
then
they
came
the
same
day
into
my
sanctuary
to
profane
it;
and,
lo,
thus
have
they
done
in
the
midst
of
mine
house.
023:040
And
furthermore,
that
ye
have
sent
for
men
to
come
from
far,
unto
whom
a
messenger
was
sent;
and,
lo,
they
came:
for
whom
thou
didst
wash
thyself,
paintedst
thy
eyes,
and
deckedst
thyself
with
ornaments,
023:041
And
satest
upon
a
stately
bed,
and
a
table
prepared
before
it,
whereupon
thou
hast
set
mine
incense
and
mine
oil.
023:042
And
a
voice
of
a
multitude
being
at
ease
was
with
her:
and
with
the
men
of
the
common
sort
were
brought
Sabeans
from
the
wilderness,
which
put
bracelets
upon
their
hands,
and
beautiful
crowns
upon
their
heads.
023:043
Then
said
I
unto
her
that
was
old
in
adulteries,
Will
they
now
commit
whoredoms
with
her,
and
she
with
them?
023:044
Yet
they
went
in
unto
her,
as
they
go
in
unto
a
woman
that
playeth
the
harlot:
so
went
they
in
unto
Aholah
and
unto
Aholibah,
the
lewd
women.
023:045
And
the
righteous
men,
they
shall
judge
them
after
the
manner
of
adulteresses,
and
after
the
manner
of
women
that
shed
blood;
because
they
are
adulteresses,
and
blood
is
in
their
hands.
023:046
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
bring
up
a
company
upon
them,
and
will
give
them
to
be
removed
and
spoiled.
023:047
And
the
company
shall
stone
them
with
stones,
and
dispatch
them
with
their
swords;
they
shall
slay
their
sons
and
their
daughters,
and
burn
up
their
houses
with
fire.
023:048
Thus
will
I
cause
lewdness
to
cease
out
of
the
land,
that
all
women
may
be
taught
not
to
do
after
your
lewdness.
023:049
And
they
shall
recompense
your
lewdness
upon
you,
and
ye
shall
bear
the
sins
of
your
idols:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
GOD.
024:001
Again
in
the
ninth
year,
in
the
tenth
month,
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month,
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
024:002
Son
of
man,
write
thee
the
name
of
the
day,
even
of
this
same
day:
the
king
of
Babylon
set
himself
against
Jerusalem
this
same
day.
024:003
And
utter
a
parable
unto
the
rebellious
house,
and
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Set
on
a
pot,
set
it
on,
and
also
pour
water
into
it:
024:004
Gather
the
pieces
thereof
into
it,
even
every
good
piece,
the
thigh,
and
the
shoulder;
fill
it
with
the
choice
bones.
024:005
Take
the
choice
of
the
flock,
and
burn
also
the
bones
under
it,
and
make
it
boil
well,
and
let
them
seethe
the
bones
of
it
therein.
024:006
Wherefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Woe
to
the
bloody
city,
to
the
pot
whose
scum
is
therein,
and
whose
scum
is
not
gone
out
of
it!
bring
it
out
piece
by
piece;
let
no
lot
fall
upon
it.
024:007
For
her
blood
is
in
the
midst
of
her;
she
set
it
upon
the
top
of
a
rock;
she
poured
it
not
upon
the
ground,
to
cover
it
with
dust;
024:008
That
it
might
cause
fury
to
come
up
to
take
vengeance;
I
have
set
her
blood
upon
the
top
of
a
rock,
that
it
should
not
be
covered.
024:009
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Woe
to
the
bloody
city!
I
will
even
make
the
pile
for
fire
great.
024:010
Heap
on
wood,
kindle
the
fire,
consume
the
flesh,
and
spice
it
well,
and
let
the
bones
be
burned.
024:011
Then
set
it
empty
upon
the
coals
thereof,
that
the
brass
of
it
may
be
hot,
and
may
burn,
and
that
the
filthiness
of
it
may
be
molten
in
it,
that
the
scum
of
it
may
be
consumed.
024:012
She
hath
wearied
herself
with
lies,
and
her
great
scum
went
not
forth
out
of
her:
her
scum
shall
be
in
the
fire.
024:013
In
thy
filthiness
is
lewdness:
because
I
have
purged
thee,
and
thou
wast
not
purged,
thou
shalt
not
be
purged
from
thy
filthiness
any
more,
till
I
have
caused
my
fury
to
rest
upon
thee.
024:014
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it:
it
shall
come
to
pass,
and
I
will
do
it;
I
will
not
go
back,
neither
will
I
spare,
neither
will
I
repent;
according
to
thy
ways,
and
according
to
thy
doings,
shall
they
judge
thee,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
024:015
Also
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
024:016
Son
of
man,
behold,
I
take
away
from
thee
the
desire
of
thine
eyes
with
a
stroke:
yet
neither
shalt
thou
mourn
nor
weep,
neither
shall
thy
tears
run
down.
024:017
Forbear
to
cry,
make
no
mourning
for
the
dead,
bind
the
tire
of
thine
head
upon
thee,
and
put
on
thy
shoes
upon
thy
feet,
and
cover
not
thy
lips,
and
eat
not
the
bread
of
men.
024:018
So
I
spake
unto
the
people
in
the
morning:
and
at
even
my
wife
died;
and
I
did
in
the
morning
as
I
was
commanded.
024:019
And
the
people
said
unto
me,
Wilt
thou
not
tell
us
what
these
things
are
to
us,
that
thou
doest
so?
024:020
Then
I
answered
them,
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
024:021
Speak
unto
the
house
of
Israel,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
profane
my
sanctuary,
the
excellency
of
your
strength,
the
desire
of
your
eyes,
and
that
which
your
soul
pitieth;
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
whom
ye
have
left
shall
fall
by
the
sword.
024:022
And
ye
shall
do
as
I
have
done:
ye
shall
not
cover
your
lips,
nor
eat
the
bread
of
men.
024:023
And
your
tires
shall
be
upon
your
heads,
and
your
shoes
upon
your
feet:
ye
shall
not
mourn
nor
weep;
but
ye
shall
pine
away
for
your
iniquities,
and
mourn
one
toward
another.
024:024
Thus
Ezekiel
is
unto
you
a
sign:
according
to
all
that
he
hath
done
shall
ye
do:
and
when
this
cometh,
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
GOD.
024:025
Also,
thou
son
of
man,
shall
it
not
be
in
the
day
when
I
take
from
them
their
strength,
the
joy
of
their
glory,
the
desire
of
their
eyes,
and
that
whereupon
they
set
their
minds,
their
sons
and
their
daughters,
024:026
That
he
that
escapeth
in
that
day
shall
come
unto
thee,
to
cause
thee
to
hear
it
with
thine
ears?
024:027
In
that
day
shall
thy
mouth
be
opened
to
him
which
is
escaped,
and
thou
shalt
speak,
and
be
no
more
dumb:
and
thou
shalt
be
a
sign
unto
them;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
025:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
unto
me,
saying,
025:002
Son
of
man,
set
thy
face
against
the
Ammonites,
and
prophesy
against
them;
025:003
And
say
unto
the
Ammonites,
Hear
the
word
of
the
Lord
GOD;
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
thou
saidst,
Aha,
against
my
sanctuary,
when
it
was
profaned;
and
against
the
land
of
Israel,
when
it
was
desolate;
and
against
the
house
of
Judah,
when
they
went
into
captivity;
025:004
Behold,
therefore
I
will
deliver
thee
to
the
men
of
the
east
for
a
possession,
and
they
shall
set
their
palaces
in
thee,
and
make
their
dwellings
in
thee:
they
shall
eat
thy
fruit,
and
they
shall
drink
thy
milk.
025:005
And
I
will
make
Rabbah
a
stable
for
camels,
and
the
Ammonites
a
couching
place
for
flocks:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
025:006
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
thou
hast
clapped
thine
hands,
and
stamped
with
the
feet,
and
rejoiced
in
heart
with
all
thy
despite
against
the
land
of
Israel;
025:007
Behold,
therefore
I
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
thee,
and
will
deliver
thee
for
a
spoil
to
the
heathen;
and
I
will
cut
thee
off
from
the
people,
and
I
will
cause
thee
to
perish
out
of
the
countries:
I
will
destroy
thee;
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
025:008
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
that
Moab
and
Seir
do
say,
Behold,
the
house
of
Judah
is
like
unto
all
the
heathen;
025:009
Therefore,
behold,
I
will
open
the
side
of
Moab
from
the
cities,
from
his
cities
which
are
on
his
frontiers,
the
glory
of
the
country,
Bethjeshimoth,
Baalmeon,
and
Kiriathaim,
025:010
Unto
the
men
of
the
east
with
the
Ammonites,
and
will
give
them
in
possession,
that
the
Ammonites
may
not
be
remembered
among
the
nations.
025:011
And
I
will
execute
judgments
upon
Moab;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
025:012
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
that
Edom
hath
dealt
against
the
house
of
Judah
by
taking
vengeance,
and
hath
greatly
offended,
and
revenged
himself
upon
them;
025:013
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
also
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
Edom,
and
will
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it;
and
I
will
make
it
desolate
from
Teman;
and
they
of
Dedan
shall
fall
by
the
sword.
025:014
And
I
will
lay
my
vengeance
upon
Edom
by
the
hand
of
my
people
Israel:
and
they
shall
do
in
Edom
according
to
mine
anger
and
according
to
my
fury;
and
they
shall
know
my
vengeance,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
025:015
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
the
Philistines
have
dealt
by
revenge,
and
have
taken
vengeance
with
a
despiteful
heart,
to
destroy
it
for
the
old
hatred;
025:016
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
the
Philistines,
and
I
will
cut
off
the
Cherethims,
and
destroy
the
remnant
of
the
sea
coast.
025:017
And
I
will
execute
great
vengeance
upon
them
with
furious
rebukes;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
shall
lay
my
vengeance
upon
them.
026:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year,
in
the
first
day
of
the
month,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
026:002
Son
of
man,
because
that
Tyrus
hath
said
against
Jerusalem,
Aha,
she
is
broken
that
was
the
gates
of
the
people:
she
is
turned
unto
me:
I
shall
be
replenished,
now
she
is
laid
waste:
026:003
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
O
Tyrus,
and
will
cause
many
nations
to
come
up
against
thee,
as
the
sea
causeth
his
waves
to
come
up.
026:004
And
they
shall
destroy
the
walls
of
Tyrus,
and
break
down
her
towers:
I
will
also
scrape
her
dust
from
her,
and
make
her
like
the
top
of
a
rock.
026:005
It
shall
be
a
place
for
the
spreading
of
nets
in
the
midst
of
the
sea:
for
I
have
spoken
it,
saith
the
Lord
GOD:
and
it
shall
become
a
spoil
to
the
nations.
026:006
And
her
daughters
which
are
in
the
field
shall
be
slain
by
the
sword;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
026:007
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
bring
upon
Tyrus
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon,
a
king
of
kings,
from
the
north,
with
horses,
and
with
chariots,
and
with
horsemen,
and
companies,
and
much
people.
026:008
He
shall
slay
with
the
sword
thy
daughters
in
the
field:
and
he
shall
make
a
fort
against
thee,
and
cast
a
mount
against
thee,
and
lift
up
the
buckler
against
thee.
026:009
And
he
shall
set
engines
of
war
against
thy
walls,
and
with
his
axes
he
shall
break
down
thy
towers.
026:010
By
reason
of
the
abundance
of
his
horses
their
dust
shall
cover
thee:
thy
walls
shall
shake
at
the
noise
of
the
horsemen,
and
of
the
wheels,
and
of
the
chariots,
when
he
shall
enter
into
thy
gates,
as
men
enter
into
a
city
wherein
is
made
a
breach.
026:011
With
the
hoofs
of
his
horses
shall
he
tread
down
all
thy
streets:
he
shall
slay
thy
people
by
the
sword,
and
thy
strong
garrisons
shall
go
down
to
the
ground.
026:012
And
they
shall
make
a
spoil
of
thy
riches,
and
make
a
prey
of
thy
merchandise:
and
they
shall
break
down
thy
walls,
and
destroy
thy
pleasant
houses:
and
they
shall
lay
thy
stones
and
thy
timber
and
thy
dust
in
the
midst
of
the
water.
026:013
And
I
will
cause
the
noise
of
thy
songs
to
cease;
and
the
sound
of
thy
harps
shall
be
no
more
heard.
026:014
And
I
will
make
thee
like
the
top
of
a
rock:
thou
shalt
be
a
place
to
spread
nets
upon;
thou
shalt
be
built
no
more:
for
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
026:015
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
to
Tyrus;
Shall
not
the
isles
shake
at
the
sound
of
thy
fall,
when
the
wounded
cry,
when
the
slaughter
is
made
in
the
midst
of
thee?
026:016
Then
all
the
princes
of
the
sea
shall
come
down
from
their
thrones,
and
lay
away
their
robes,
and
put
off
their
broidered
garments:
they
shall
clothe
themselves
with
trembling;
they
shall
sit
upon
the
ground,
and
shall
tremble
at
every
moment,
and
be
astonished
at
thee.
026:017
And
they
shall
take
up
a
lamentation
for
thee,
and
say
to
thee,
How
art
thou
destroyed,
that
wast
inhabited
of
seafaring
men,
the
renowned
city,
which
wast
strong
in
the
sea,
she
and
her
inhabitants,
which
cause
their
terror
to
be
on
all
that
haunt
it!
026:018
Now
shall
the
isles
tremble
in
the
day
of
thy
fall;
yea,
the
isles
that
are
in
the
sea
shall
be
troubled
at
thy
departure.
026:019
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
When
I
shall
make
thee
a
desolate
city,
like
the
cities
that
are
not
inhabited;
when
I
shall
bring
up
the
deep
upon
thee,
and
great
waters
shall
cover
thee;
026:020
When
I
shall
bring
thee
down
with
them
that
descend
into
the
pit,
with
the
people
of
old
time,
and
shall
set
thee
in
the
low
parts
of
the
earth,
in
places
desolate
of
old,
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit,
that
thou
be
not
inhabited;
and
I
shall
set
glory
in
the
land
of
the
living;
026:021
I
will
make
thee
a
terror,
and
thou
shalt
be
no
more:
though
thou
be
sought
for,
yet
shalt
thou
never
be
found
again,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
027:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
unto
me,
saying,
027:002
Now,
thou
son
of
man,
take
up
a
lamentation
for
Tyrus;
027:003
And
say
unto
Tyrus,
O
thou
that
art
situate
at
the
entry
of
the
sea,
which
art
a
merchant
of
the
people
for
many
isles,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
O
Tyrus,
thou
hast
said,
I
am
of
perfect
beauty.
027:004
Thy
borders
are
in
the
midst
of
the
seas,
thy
builders
have
perfected
thy
beauty.
027:005
They
have
made
all
thy
ship
boards
of
fir
trees
of
Senir:
they
have
taken
cedars
from
Lebanon
to
make
masts
for
thee.
027:006
Of
the
oaks
of
Bashan
have
they
made
thine
oars;
the
company
of
the
Ashurites
have
made
thy
benches
of
ivory,
brought
out
of
the
isles
of
Chittim.
027:007
Fine
linen
with
broidered
work
from
Egypt
was
that
which
thou
spreadest
forth
to
be
thy
sail;
blue
and
purple
from
the
isles
of
Elishah
was
that
which
covered
thee.
027:008
The
