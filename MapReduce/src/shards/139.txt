inhabitants
of
Zidon
and
Arvad
were
thy
mariners:
thy
wise
men,
O
Tyrus,
that
were
in
thee,
were
thy
pilots.
027:009
The
ancients
of
Gebal
and
the
wise
men
thereof
were
in
thee
thy
calkers:
all
the
ships
of
the
sea
with
their
mariners
were
in
thee
to
occupy
thy
merchandise.
027:010
They
of
Persia
and
of
Lud
and
of
Phut
were
in
thine
army,
thy
men
of
war:
they
hanged
the
shield
and
helmet
in
thee;
they
set
forth
thy
comeliness.
027:011
The
men
of
Arvad
with
thine
army
were
upon
thy
walls
round
about,
and
the
Gammadims
were
in
thy
towers:
they
hanged
their
shields
upon
thy
walls
round
about;
they
have
made
thy
beauty
perfect.
027:012
Tarshish
was
thy
merchant
by
reason
of
the
multitude
of
all
kind
of
riches;
with
silver,
iron,
tin,
and
lead,
they
traded
in
thy
fairs.
027:013
Javan,
Tubal,
and
Meshech,
they
were
thy
merchants:
they
traded
the
persons
of
men
and
vessels
of
brass
in
thy
market.
027:014
They
of
the
house
of
Togarmah
traded
in
thy
fairs
with
horses
and
horsemen
and
mules.
027:015
The
men
of
Dedan
were
thy
merchants;
many
isles
were
the
merchandise
of
thine
hand:
they
brought
thee
for
a
present
horns
of
ivory
and
ebony.
027:016
Syria
was
thy
merchant
by
reason
of
the
multitude
of
the
wares
of
thy
making:
they
occupied
in
thy
fairs
with
emeralds,
purple,
and
broidered
work,
and
fine
linen,
and
coral,
and
agate.
027:017
Judah,
and
the
land
of
Israel,
they
were
thy
merchants:
they
traded
in
thy
market
wheat
of
Minnith,
and
Pannag,
and
honey,
and
oil,
and
balm.
027:018
Damascus
was
thy
merchant
in
the
multitude
of
the
wares
of
thy
making,
for
the
multitude
of
all
riches;
in
the
wine
of
Helbon,
and
white
wool.
027:019
Dan
also
and
Javan
going
to
and
fro
occupied
in
thy
fairs:
bright
iron,
cassia,
and
calamus,
were
in
thy
market.
027:020
Dedan
was
thy
merchant
in
precious
clothes
for
chariots.
027:021
Arabia,
and
all
the
princes
of
Kedar,
they
occupied
with
thee
in
lambs,
and
rams,
and
goats:
in
these
were
they
thy
merchants.
027:022
The
merchants
of
Sheba
and
Raamah,
they
were
thy
merchants:
they
occupied
in
thy
fairs
with
chief
of
all
spices,
and
with
all
precious
stones,
and
gold.
027:023
Haran,
and
Canneh,
and
Eden,
the
merchants
of
Sheba,
Asshur,
and
Chilmad,
were
thy
merchants.
027:024
These
were
thy
merchants
in
all
sorts
of
things,
in
blue
clothes,
and
broidered
work,
and
in
chests
of
rich
apparel,
bound
with
cords,
and
made
of
cedar,
among
thy
merchandise.
027:025
The
ships
of
Tarshish
did
sing
of
thee
in
thy
market:
and
thou
wast
replenished,
and
made
very
glorious
in
the
midst
of
the
seas.
027:026
Thy
rowers
have
brought
thee
into
great
waters:
the
east
wind
hath
broken
thee
in
the
midst
of
the
seas.
027:027
Thy
riches,
and
thy
fairs,
thy
merchandise,
thy
mariners,
and
thy
pilots,
thy
calkers,
and
the
occupiers
of
thy
merchandise,
and
all
thy
men
of
war,
that
are
in
thee,
and
in
all
thy
company
which
is
in
the
midst
of
thee,
shall
fall
into
the
midst
of
the
seas
in
the
day
of
thy
ruin.
027:028
The
suburbs
shall
shake
at
the
sound
of
the
cry
of
thy
pilots.
027:029
And
all
that
handle
the
oar,
the
mariners,
and
all
the
pilots
of
the
sea,
shall
come
down
from
their
ships,
they
shall
stand
upon
the
land;
027:030
And
shall
cause
their
voice
to
be
heard
against
thee,
and
shall
cry
bitterly,
and
shall
cast
up
dust
upon
their
heads,
they
shall
wallow
themselves
in
the
ashes:
027:031
And
they
shall
make
themselves
utterly
bald
for
thee,
and
gird
them
with
sackcloth,
and
they
shall
weep
for
thee
with
bitterness
of
heart
and
bitter
wailing.
027:032
And
in
their
wailing
they
shall
take
up
a
lamentation
for
thee,
and
lament
over
thee,
saying,
What
city
is
like
Tyrus,
like
the
destroyed
in
the
midst
of
the
sea?
027:033
When
thy
wares
went
forth
out
of
the
seas,
thou
filledst
many
people;
thou
didst
enrich
the
kings
of
the
earth
with
the
multitude
of
thy
riches
and
of
thy
merchandise.
027:034
In
the
time
when
thou
shalt
be
broken
by
the
seas
in
the
depths
of
the
waters
thy
merchandise
and
all
thy
company
in
the
midst
of
thee
shall
fall.
027:035
All
the
inhabitants
of
the
isles
shall
be
astonished
at
thee,
and
their
kings
shall
be
sore
afraid,
they
shall
be
troubled
in
their
countenance.
027:036
The
merchants
among
the
people
shall
hiss
at
thee;
thou
shalt
be
a
terror,
and
never
shalt
be
any
more.
028:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
unto
me,
saying,
028:002
Son
of
man,
say
unto
the
prince
of
Tyrus,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
thine
heart
is
lifted
up,
and
thou
hast
said,
I
am
a
God,
I
sit
in
the
seat
of
God,
in
the
midst
of
the
seas;
yet
thou
art
a
man,
and
not
God,
though
thou
set
thine
heart
as
the
heart
of
God:
028:003
Behold,
thou
art
wiser
than
Daniel;
there
is
no
secret
that
they
can
hide
from
thee:
028:004
With
thy
wisdom
and
with
thine
understanding
thou
hast
gotten
thee
riches,
and
hast
gotten
gold
and
silver
into
thy
treasures:
028:005
By
thy
great
wisdom
and
by
thy
traffick
hast
thou
increased
thy
riches,
and
thine
heart
is
lifted
up
because
of
thy
riches:
028:006
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
thou
hast
set
thine
heart
as
the
heart
of
God;
028:007
Behold,
therefore
I
will
bring
strangers
upon
thee,
the
terrible
of
the
nations:
and
they
shall
draw
their
swords
against
the
beauty
of
thy
wisdom,
and
they
shall
defile
thy
brightness.
028:008
They
shall
bring
thee
down
to
the
pit,
and
thou
shalt
die
the
deaths
of
them
that
are
slain
in
the
midst
of
the
seas.
028:009
Wilt
thou
yet
say
before
him
that
slayeth
thee,
I
am
God?
but
thou
shalt
be
a
man,
and
no
God,
in
the
hand
of
him
that
slayeth
thee.
028:010
Thou
shalt
die
the
deaths
of
the
uncircumcised
by
the
hand
of
strangers:
for
I
have
spoken
it,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
028:011
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
028:012
Son
of
man,
take
up
a
lamentation
upon
the
king
of
Tyrus,
and
say
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Thou
sealest
up
the
sum,
full
of
wisdom,
and
perfect
in
beauty.
028:013
Thou
hast
been
in
Eden
the
garden
of
God;
every
precious
stone
was
thy
covering,
the
sardius,
topaz,
and
the
diamond,
the
beryl,
the
onyx,
and
the
jasper,
the
sapphire,
the
emerald,
and
the
carbuncle,
and
gold:
the
workmanship
of
thy
tabrets
and
of
thy
pipes
was
prepared
in
thee
in
the
day
that
thou
wast
created.
028:014
Thou
art
the
anointed
cherub
that
covereth;
and
I
have
set
thee
so:
thou
wast
upon
the
holy
mountain
of
God;
thou
hast
walked
up
and
down
in
the
midst
of
the
stones
of
fire.
028:015
Thou
wast
perfect
in
thy
ways
from
the
day
that
thou
wast
created,
till
iniquity
was
found
in
thee.
028:016
By
the
multitude
of
thy
merchandise
they
have
filled
the
midst
of
thee
with
violence,
and
thou
hast
sinned:
therefore
I
will
cast
thee
as
profane
out
of
the
mountain
of
God:
and
I
will
destroy
thee,
O
covering
cherub,
from
the
midst
of
the
stones
of
fire.
028:017
Thine
heart
was
lifted
up
because
of
thy
beauty,
thou
hast
corrupted
thy
wisdom
by
reason
of
thy
brightness:
I
will
cast
thee
to
the
ground,
I
will
lay
thee
before
kings,
that
they
may
behold
thee.
028:018
Thou
hast
defiled
thy
sanctuaries
by
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquities,
by
the
iniquity
of
thy
traffick;
therefore
will
I
bring
forth
a
fire
from
the
midst
of
thee,
it
shall
devour
thee,
and
I
will
bring
thee
to
ashes
upon
the
earth
in
the
sight
of
all
them
that
behold
thee.
028:019
All
they
that
know
thee
among
the
people
shall
be
astonished
at
thee:
thou
shalt
be
a
terror,
and
never
shalt
thou
be
any
more.
028:020
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
028:021
Son
of
man,
set
thy
face
against
Zidon,
and
prophesy
against
it,
028:022
And
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
O
Zidon;
and
I
will
be
glorified
in
the
midst
of
thee:
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
shall
have
executed
judgments
in
her,
and
shall
be
sanctified
in
her.
028:023
For
I
will
send
into
her
pestilence,
and
blood
into
her
streets;
and
the
wounded
shall
be
judged
in
the
midst
of
her
by
the
sword
upon
her
on
every
side;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
028:024
And
there
shall
be
no
more
a
pricking
brier
unto
the
house
of
Israel,
nor
any
grieving
thorn
of
all
that
are
round
about
them,
that
despised
them;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
GOD.
028:025
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
When
I
shall
have
gathered
the
house
of
Israel
from
the
people
among
whom
they
are
scattered,
and
shall
be
sanctified
in
them
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen,
then
shall
they
dwell
in
their
land
that
I
have
given
to
my
servant
Jacob.
028:026
And
they
shall
dwell
safely
therein,
and
shall
build
houses,
and
plant
vineyards;
yea,
they
shall
dwell
with
confidence,
when
I
have
executed
judgments
upon
all
those
that
despise
them
round
about
them;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
their
God.
029:001
In
the
tenth
year,
in
the
tenth
month,
in
the
twelfth
day
of
the
month,
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
029:002
Son
of
man,
set
thy
face
against
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
and
prophesy
against
him,
and
against
all
Egypt:
029:003
Speak,
and
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
the
great
dragon
that
lieth
in
the
midst
of
his
rivers,
which
hath
said,
My
river
is
mine
own,
and
I
have
made
it
for
myself.
029:004
But
I
will
put
hooks
in
thy
jaws,
and
I
will
cause
the
fish
of
thy
rivers
to
stick
unto
thy
scales,
and
I
will
bring
thee
up
out
of
the
midst
of
thy
rivers,
and
all
the
fish
of
thy
rivers
shall
stick
unto
thy
scales.
029:005
And
I
will
leave
thee
thrown
into
the
wilderness,
thee
and
all
the
fish
of
thy
rivers:
thou
shalt
fall
upon
the
open
fields;
thou
shalt
not
be
brought
together,
nor
gathered:
I
have
given
thee
for
meat
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
to
the
fowls
of
the
heaven.
029:006
And
all
the
inhabitants
of
Egypt
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
because
they
have
been
a
staff
of
reed
to
the
house
of
Israel.
029:007
When
they
took
hold
of
thee
by
thy
hand,
thou
didst
break,
and
rend
all
their
shoulder:
and
when
they
leaned
upon
thee,
thou
brakest,
and
madest
all
their
loins
to
be
at
a
stand.
029:008
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
bring
a
sword
upon
thee,
and
cut
off
man
and
beast
out
of
thee.
029:009
And
the
land
of
Egypt
shall
be
desolate
and
waste;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD:
because
he
hath
said,
The
river
is
mine,
and
I
have
made
it.
029:010
Behold,
therefore
I
am
against
thee,
and
against
thy
rivers,
and
I
will
make
the
land
of
Egypt
utterly
waste
and
desolate,
from
the
tower
of
Syene
even
unto
the
border
of
Ethiopia.
029:011
No
foot
of
man
shall
pass
through
it,
nor
foot
of
beast
shall
pass
through
it,
neither
shall
it
be
inhabited
forty
years.
029:012
And
I
will
make
the
land
of
Egypt
desolate
in
the
midst
of
the
countries
that
are
desolate,
and
her
cities
among
the
cities
that
are
laid
waste
shall
be
desolate
forty
years:
and
I
will
scatter
the
Egyptians
among
the
nations,
and
will
disperse
them
through
the
countries.
029:013
Yet
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
At
the
end
of
forty
years
will
I
gather
the
Egyptians
from
the
people
whither
they
were
scattered:
029:014
And
I
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
Egypt,
and
will
cause
them
to
return
into
the
land
of
Pathros,
into
the
land
of
their
habitation;
and
they
shall
be
there
a
base
kingdom.
029:015
It
shall
be
the
basest
of
the
kingdoms;
neither
shall
it
exalt
itself
any
more
above
the
nations:
for
I
will
diminish
them,
that
they
shall
no
more
rule
over
the
nations.
029:016
And
it
shall
be
no
more
the
confidence
of
the
house
of
Israel,
which
bringeth
their
iniquity
to
remembrance,
when
they
shall
look
after
them:
but
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
GOD.
029:017
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seven
and
twentieth
year,
in
the
first
month,
in
the
first
day
of
the
month,
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
029:018
Son
of
man,
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
caused
his
army
to
serve
a
great
service
against
Tyrus:
every
head
was
made
bald,
and
every
shoulder
was
peeled:
yet
had
he
no
wages,
nor
his
army,
for
Tyrus,
for
the
service
that
he
had
served
against
it:
029:019
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
give
the
land
of
Egypt
unto
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon;
and
he
shall
take
her
multitude,
and
take
her
spoil,
and
take
her
prey;
and
it
shall
be
the
wages
for
his
army.
029:020
I
have
given
him
the
land
of
Egypt
for
his
labour
wherewith
he
served
against
it,
because
they
wrought
for
me,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
029:021
In
that
day
will
I
cause
the
horn
of
the
house
of
Israel
to
bud
forth,
and
I
will
give
thee
the
opening
of
the
mouth
in
the
midst
of
them;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
030:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
unto
me,
saying,
030:002
Son
of
man,
prophesy
and
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Howl
ye,
Woe
worth
the
day!
030:003
For
the
day
is
near,
even
the
day
of
the
LORD
is
near,
a
cloudy
day;
it
shall
be
the
time
of
the
heathen.
030:004
And
the
sword
shall
come
upon
Egypt,
and
great
pain
shall
be
in
Ethiopia,
when
the
slain
shall
fall
in
Egypt,
and
they
shall
take
away
her
multitude,
and
her
foundations
shall
be
broken
down.
030:005
Ethiopia,
and
Libya,
and
Lydia,
and
all
the
mingled
people,
and
Chub,
and
the
men
of
the
land
that
is
in
league,
shall
fall
with
them
by
the
sword.
030:006
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
They
also
that
uphold
Egypt
shall
fall;
and
the
pride
of
her
power
shall
come
down:
from
the
tower
of
Syene
shall
they
fall
in
it
by
the
sword,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
030:007
And
they
shall
be
desolate
in
the
midst
of
the
countries
that
are
desolate,
and
her
cities
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
the
cities
that
are
wasted.
030:008
And
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
have
set
a
fire
in
Egypt,
and
when
all
her
helpers
shall
be
destroyed.
030:009
In
that
day
shall
messengers
go
forth
from
me
in
ships
to
make
the
careless
Ethiopians
afraid,
and
great
pain
shall
come
upon
them,
as
in
the
day
of
Egypt:
for,
lo,
it
cometh.
030:010
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
also
make
the
multitude
of
Egypt
to
cease
by
the
hand
of
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon.
030:011
He
and
his
people
with
him,
the
terrible
of
the
nations,
shall
be
brought
to
destroy
the
land:
and
they
shall
draw
their
swords
against
Egypt,
and
fill
the
land
with
the
slain.
030:012
And
I
will
make
the
rivers
dry,
and
sell
the
land
into
the
hand
of
the
wicked:
and
I
will
make
the
land
waste,
and
all
that
is
therein,
by
the
hand
of
strangers:
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it.
030:013
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
also
destroy
the
idols,
and
I
will
cause
their
images
to
cease
out
of
Noph;
and
there
shall
be
no
more
a
prince
of
the
land
of
Egypt:
and
I
will
put
a
fear
in
the
land
of
Egypt.
030:014
And
I
will
make
Pathros
desolate,
and
will
set
fire
in
Zoan,
and
will
execute
judgments
in
No.
030:015
And
I
will
pour
my
fury
upon
Sin,
the
strength
of
Egypt;
and
I
will
cut
off
the
multitude
of
No.
030:016
And
I
will
set
fire
in
Egypt:
Sin
shall
have
great
pain,
and
No
shall
be
rent
asunder,
and
Noph
shall
have
distresses
daily.
030:017
The
young
men
of
Aven
and
of
Pibeseth
shall
fall
by
the
sword:
and
these
cities
shall
go
into
captivity.
030:018
At
Tehaphnehes
also
the
day
shall
be
darkened,
when
I
shall
break
there
the
yokes
of
Egypt:
and
the
pomp
of
her
strength
shall
cease
in
her:
as
for
her,
a
cloud
shall
cover
her,
and
her
daughters
shall
go
into
captivity.
030:019
Thus
will
I
execute
judgments
in
Egypt:
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
030:020
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year,
in
the
first
month,
in
the
seventh
day
of
the
month,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
030:021
Son
of
man,
I
have
broken
the
arm
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt;
and,
lo,
it
shall
not
be
bound
up
to
be
healed,
to
put
a
roller
to
bind
it,
to
make
it
strong
to
hold
the
sword.
030:022
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
am
against
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
and
will
break
his
arms,
the
strong,
and
that
which
was
broken;
and
I
will
cause
the
sword
to
fall
out
of
his
hand.
030:023
And
I
will
scatter
the
Egyptians
among
the
nations,
and
will
disperse
them
through
the
countries.
030:024
And
I
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
put
my
sword
in
his
hand:
but
I
will
break
Pharaoh's
arms,
and
he
shall
groan
before
him
with
the
groanings
of
a
deadly
wounded
man.
030:025
But
I
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
the
arms
of
Pharaoh
shall
fall
down;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
shall
put
my
sword
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
and
he
shall
stretch
it
out
upon
the
land
of
Egypt.
030:026
And
I
will
scatter
the
Egyptians
among
the
nations,
and
disperse
them
among
the
countries;
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
031:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year,
in
the
third
month,
in
the
first
day
of
the
month,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
031:002
Son
of
man,
speak
unto
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
and
to
his
multitude;
Whom
art
thou
like
in
thy
greatness?
031:003
Behold,
the
Assyrian
was
a
cedar
in
Lebanon
with
fair
branches,
and
with
a
shadowing
shroud,
and
of
an
high
stature;
and
his
top
was
among
the
thick
boughs.
031:004
The
waters
made
him
great,
the
deep
set
him
up
on
high
with
her
rivers
running
round
about
his
plants,
and
sent
her
little
rivers
unto
all
the
trees
of
the
field.
031:005
Therefore
his
height
was
exalted
above
all
the
trees
of
the
field,
and
his
boughs
were
multiplied,
and
his
branches
became
long
because
of
the
multitude
of
waters,
when
he
shot
forth.
031:006
All
the
fowls
of
heaven
made
their
nests
in
his
boughs,
and
under
his
branches
did
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
bring
forth
their
young,
and
under
his
shadow
dwelt
all
great
nations.
031:007
Thus
was
he
fair
in
his
greatness,
in
the
length
of
his
branches:
for
his
root
was
by
great
waters.
031:008
The
cedars
in
the
garden
of
God
could
not
hide
him:
the
fir
trees
were
not
like
his
boughs,
and
the
chestnut
trees
were
not
like
his
branches;
nor
any
tree
in
the
garden
of
God
was
like
unto
him
in
his
beauty.
031:009
I
have
made
him
fair
by
the
multitude
of
his
branches:
so
that
all
the
trees
of
Eden,
that
were
in
the
garden
of
God,
envied
him.
031:010
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
thou
hast
lifted
up
thyself
in
height,
and
he
hath
shot
up
his
top
among
the
thick
boughs,
and
his
heart
is
lifted
up
in
his
height;
031:011
I
have
therefore
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
the
mighty
one
of
the
heathen;
he
shall
surely
deal
with
him:
I
have
driven
him
out
for
his
wickedness.
031:012
And
strangers,
the
terrible
of
the
nations,
have
cut
him
off,
and
have
left
him:
upon
the
mountains
and
in
all
the
valleys
his
branches
are
fallen,
and
his
boughs
are
broken
by
all
the
rivers
of
the
land;
and
all
the
people
of
the
earth
are
gone
down
from
his
shadow,
and
have
left
him.
031:013
Upon
his
ruin
shall
all
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
remain,
and
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
be
upon
his
branches:
031:014
To
the
end
that
none
of
all
the
trees
by
the
waters
exalt
themselves
for
their
height,
neither
shoot
up
their
top
among
the
thick
boughs,
neither
their
trees
stand
up
in
their
height,
all
that
drink
water:
for
they
are
all
delivered
unto
death,
to
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth,
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
men,
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit.
031:015
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
In
the
day
when
he
went
down
to
the
grave
I
caused
a
mourning:
I
covered
the
deep
for
him,
and
I
restrained
the
floods
thereof,
and
the
great
waters
were
stayed:
and
I
caused
Lebanon
to
mourn
for
him,
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
fainted
for
him.
031:016
I
made
the
nations
to
shake
at
the
sound
of
his
fall,
when
I
cast
him
down
to
hell
with
them
that
descend
into
the
pit:
and
all
the
trees
of
Eden,
the
choice
and
best
of
Lebanon,
all
that
drink
water,
shall
be
comforted
in
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth.
031:017
They
also
went
down
into
hell
with
him
unto
them
that
be
slain
with
the
sword;
and
they
that
were
his
arm,
that
dwelt
under
his
shadow
in
the
midst
of
the
heathen.
031:018
To
whom
art
thou
thus
like
in
glory
and
in
greatness
among
the
trees
of
Eden?
yet
shalt
thou
be
brought
down
with
the
trees
of
Eden
unto
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth:
thou
shalt
lie
in
the
midst
of
the
uncircumcised
with
them
that
be
slain
by
the
sword.
This
is
Pharaoh
and
all
his
multitude,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
032:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twelfth
year,
in
the
twelfth
month,
in
the
first
day
of
the
month,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
032:002
Son
of
man,
take
up
a
lamentation
for
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
and
say
unto
him,
Thou
art
like
a
young
lion
of
the
nations,
and
thou
art
as
a
whale
in
the
seas:
and
thou
camest
forth
with
thy
rivers,
and
troubledst
the
waters
with
thy
feet,
and
fouledst
their
rivers.
032:003
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
therefore
spread
out
my
net
over
thee
with
a
company
of
many
people;
and
they
shall
bring
thee
up
in
my
net.
032:004
Then
will
I
leave
thee
upon
the
land,
I
will
cast
thee
forth
upon
the
open
field,
and
will
cause
all
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
to
remain
upon
thee,
and
I
will
fill
the
beasts
of
the
whole
earth
with
thee.
032:005
And
I
will
lay
thy
flesh
upon
the
mountains,
and
fill
the
valleys
with
thy
height.
032:006
I
will
also
water
with
thy
blood
the
land
wherein
thou
swimmest,
even
to
the
mountains;
and
the
rivers
shall
be
full
of
thee.
032:007
And
when
I
shall
put
thee
out,
I
will
cover
the
heaven,
and
make
the
stars
thereof
dark;
I
will
cover
the
sun
with
a
cloud,
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light.
032:008
All
the
bright
lights
of
heaven
will
I
make
dark
over
thee,
and
set
darkness
upon
thy
land,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
032:009
I
will
also
vex
the
hearts
of
many
