lieth
with
a
beast
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
022:020
He
that
sacrificeth
unto
any
god,
save
unto
the
LORD
only,
he
shall
be
utterly
destroyed.
022:021
Thou
shalt
neither
vex
a
stranger,
nor
oppress
him:
for
ye
were
strangers
in
the
land
of
Egypt.
022:022
Ye
shall
not
afflict
any
widow,
or
fatherless
child.
022:023
If
thou
afflict
them
in
any
wise,
and
they
cry
at
all
unto
me,
I
will
surely
hear
their
cry;
022:024
And
my
wrath
shall
wax
hot,
and
I
will
kill
you
with
the
sword;
and
your
wives
shall
be
widows,
and
your
children
fatherless.
022:025
If
thou
lend
money
to
any
of
my
people
that
is
poor
by
thee,
thou
shalt
not
be
to
him
as
an
usurer,
neither
shalt
thou
lay
upon
him
usury.
022:026
If
thou
at
all
take
thy
neighbour's
raiment
to
pledge,
thou
shalt
deliver
it
unto
him
by
that
the
sun
goeth
down:
022:027
For
that
is
his
covering
only,
it
is
his
raiment
for
his
skin:
wherein
shall
he
sleep?
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
he
crieth
unto
me,
that
I
will
hear;
for
I
am
gracious.
022:028
Thou
shalt
not
revile
the
gods,
nor
curse
the
ruler
of
thy
people.
022:029
Thou
shalt
not
delay
to
offer
the
first
of
thy
ripe
fruits,
and
of
thy
liquors:
the
firstborn
of
thy
sons
shalt
thou
give
unto
me.
022:030
Likewise
shalt
thou
do
with
thine
oxen,
and
with
thy
sheep:
seven
days
it
shall
be
with
his
dam;
on
the
eighth
day
thou
shalt
give
it
me.
022:031
And
ye
shall
be
holy
men
unto
me:
neither
shall
ye
eat
any
flesh
that
is
torn
of
beasts
in
the
field;
ye
shall
cast
it
to
the
dogs.
023:001
Thou
shalt
not
raise
a
false
report:
put
not
thine
hand
with
the
wicked
to
be
an
unrighteous
witness.
023:002
Thou
shalt
not
follow
a
multitude
to
do
evil;
neither
shalt
thou
speak
in
a
cause
to
decline
after
many
to
wrest
judgment:
023:003
Neither
shalt
thou
countenance
a
poor
man
in
his
cause.
023:004
If
thou
meet
thine
enemy's
ox
or
his
ass
going
astray,
thou
shalt
surely
bring
it
back
to
him
again.
023:005
If
thou
see
the
ass
of
him
that
hateth
thee
lying
under
his
burden,
and
wouldest
forbear
to
help
him,
thou
shalt
surely
help
with
him.
023:006
Thou
shalt
not
wrest
the
judgment
of
thy
poor
in
his
cause.
023:007
Keep
thee
far
from
a
false
matter;
and
the
innocent
and
righteous
slay
thou
not:
for
I
will
not
justify
the
wicked.
023:008
And
thou
shalt
take
no
gift:
for
the
gift
blindeth
the
wise,
and
perverteth
the
words
of
the
righteous.
023:009
Also
thou
shalt
not
oppress
a
stranger:
for
ye
know
the
heart
of
a
stranger,
seeing
ye
were
strangers
in
the
land
of
Egypt.
023:010
And
six
years
thou
shalt
sow
thy
land,
and
shalt
gather
in
the
fruits
thereof:
023:011
But
the
seventh
year
thou
shalt
let
it
rest
and
lie
still;
that
the
poor
of
thy
people
may
eat:
and
what
they
leave
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
eat.
In
like
manner
thou
shalt
deal
with
thy
vineyard,
and
with
thy
oliveyard.
023:012
Six
days
thou
shalt
do
thy
work,
and
on
the
seventh
day
thou
shalt
rest:
that
thine
ox
and
thine
ass
may
rest,
and
the
son
of
thy
handmaid,
and
the
stranger,
may
be
refreshed.
023:013
And
in
all
things
that
I
have
said
unto
you
be
circumspect:
and
make
no
mention
of
the
name
of
other
gods,
neither
let
it
be
heard
out
of
thy
mouth.
023:014
Three
times
thou
shalt
keep
a
feast
unto
me
in
the
year.
023:015
Thou
shalt
keep
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread:
(thou
shalt
eat
unleavened
bread
seven
days,
as
I
commanded
thee,
in
the
time
appointed
of
the
month
Abib;
for
in
it
thou
camest
out
from
Egypt:
and
none
shall
appear
before
me
empty:)
023:016
And
the
feast
of
harvest,
the
firstfruits
of
thy
labours,
which
thou
hast
sown
in
the
field:
and
the
feast
of
ingathering,
which
is
in
the
end
of
the
year,
when
thou
hast
gathered
in
thy
labours
out
of
the
field.
023:017
Three
items
in
the
year
all
thy
males
shall
appear
before
the
LORD
God.
023:018
Thou
shalt
not
offer
the
blood
of
my
sacrifice
with
leavened
bread;
neither
shall
the
fat
of
my
sacrifice
remain
until
the
morning.
023:019
The
first
of
the
firstfruits
of
thy
land
thou
shalt
bring
into
the
house
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
Thou
shalt
not
seethe
a
kid
in
his
mother's
milk.
023:020
Behold,
I
send
an
Angel
before
thee,
to
keep
thee
in
the
way,
and
to
bring
thee
into
the
place
which
I
have
prepared.
023:021
Beware
of
him,
and
obey
his
voice,
provoke
him
not;
for
he
will
not
pardon
your
transgressions:
for
my
name
is
in
him.
023:022
But
if
thou
shalt
indeed
obey
his
voice,
and
do
all
that
I
speak;
then
I
will
be
an
enemy
unto
thine
enemies,
and
an
adversary
unto
thine
adversaries.
023:023
For
mine
Angel
shall
go
before
thee,
and
bring
thee
in
unto
the
Amorites,
and
the
Hittites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Canaanites,
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites:
and
I
will
cut
them
off.
023:024
Thou
shalt
not
bow
down
to
their
gods,
nor
serve
them,
nor
do
after
their
works:
but
thou
shalt
utterly
overthrow
them,
and
quite
break
down
their
images.
023:025
And
ye
shall
serve
the
LORD
your
God,
and
he
shall
bless
thy
bread,
and
thy
water;
and
I
will
take
sickness
away
from
the
midst
of
thee.
023:026
There
shall
nothing
cast
their
young,
nor
be
barren,
in
thy
land:
the
number
of
thy
days
I
will
fulfil.
023:027
I
will
send
my
fear
before
thee,
and
will
destroy
all
the
people
to
whom
thou
shalt
come,
and
I
will
make
all
thine
enemies
turn
their
backs
unto
thee.
023:028
And
I
will
send
hornets
before
thee,
which
shall
drive
out
the
Hivite,
the
Canaanite,
and
the
Hittite,
from
before
thee.
023:029
I
will
not
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
in
one
year;
lest
the
land
become
desolate,
and
the
beast
of
the
field
multiply
against
thee.
023:030
By
little
and
little
I
will
drive
them
out
from
before
thee,
until
thou
be
increased,
and
inherit
the
land.
023:031
And
I
will
set
thy
bounds
from
the
Red
sea
even
unto
the
sea
of
the
Philistines,
and
from
the
desert
unto
the
river:
for
I
will
deliver
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
into
your
hand;
and
thou
shalt
drive
them
out
before
thee.
023:032
Thou
shalt
make
no
covenant
with
them,
nor
with
their
gods.
023:033
They
shall
not
dwell
in
thy
land,
lest
they
make
thee
sin
against
me:
for
if
thou
serve
their
gods,
it
will
surely
be
a
snare
unto
thee.
024:001
And
he
said
unto
Moses,
Come
up
unto
the
LORD,
thou,
and
Aaron,
Nadab,
and
Abihu,
and
seventy
of
the
elders
of
Israel;
and
worship
ye
afar
off.
024:002
And
Moses
alone
shall
come
near
the
LORD:
but
they
shall
not
come
nigh;
neither
shall
the
people
go
up
with
him.
024:003
And
Moses
came
and
told
the
people
all
the
words
of
the
LORD,
and
all
the
judgments:
and
all
the
people
answered
with
one
voice,
and
said,
All
the
words
which
the
LORD
hath
said
will
we
do.
024:004
And
Moses
wrote
all
the
words
of
the
LORD,
and
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
builded
an
altar
under
the
hill,
and
twelve
pillars,
according
to
the
twelve
tribes
of
Israel.
024:005
And
he
sent
young
men
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
offered
burnt
offerings,
and
sacrificed
peace
offerings
of
oxen
unto
the
LORD.
024:006
And
Moses
took
half
of
the
blood,
and
put
it
in
basons;
and
half
of
the
blood
he
sprinkled
on
the
altar.
024:007
And
he
took
the
book
of
the
covenant,
and
read
in
the
audience
of
the
people:
and
they
said,
All
that
the
LORD
hath
said
will
we
do,
and
be
obedient.
024:008
And
Moses
took
the
blood,
and
sprinkled
it
on
the
people,
and
said,
Behold
the
blood
of
the
covenant,
which
the
LORD
hath
made
with
you
concerning
all
these
words.
024:009
Then
went
up
Moses,
and
Aaron,
Nadab,
and
Abihu,
and
seventy
of
the
elders
of
Israel:
024:010
And
they
saw
the
God
of
Israel:
and
there
was
under
his
feet
as
it
were
a
paved
work
of
a
sapphire
stone,
and
as
it
were
the
body
of
heaven
in
his
clearness.
024:011
And
upon
the
nobles
of
the
children
of
Israel
he
laid
not
his
hand:
also
they
saw
God,
and
did
eat
and
drink.
024:012
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Come
up
to
me
into
the
mount,
and
be
there:
and
I
will
give
thee
tables
of
stone,
and
a
law,
and
commandments
which
I
have
written;
that
thou
mayest
teach
them.
024:013
And
Moses
rose
up,
and
his
minister
Joshua:
and
Moses
went
up
into
the
mount
of
God.
024:014
And
he
said
unto
the
elders,
Tarry
ye
here
for
us,
until
we
come
again
unto
you:
and,
behold,
Aaron
and
Hur
are
with
you:
if
any
man
have
any
matters
to
do,
let
him
come
unto
them.
024:015
And
Moses
went
up
into
the
mount,
and
a
cloud
covered
the
mount.
024:016
And
the
glory
of
the
LORD
abode
upon
mount
Sinai,
and
the
cloud
covered
it
six
days:
and
the
seventh
day
he
called
unto
Moses
out
of
the
midst
of
the
cloud.
024:017
And
the
sight
of
the
glory
of
the
LORD
was
like
devouring
fire
on
the
top
of
the
mount
in
the
eyes
of
the
children
of
Israel.
024:018
And
Moses
went
into
the
midst
of
the
cloud,
and
gat
him
up
into
the
mount:
and
Moses
was
in
the
mount
forty
days
and
forty
nights.
025:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
025:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
bring
me
an
offering:
of
every
man
that
giveth
it
willingly
with
his
heart
ye
shall
take
my
offering.
025:003
And
this
is
the
offering
which
ye
shall
take
of
them;
gold,
and
silver,
and
brass,
025:004
And
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
fine
linen,
and
goats'
hair,
025:005
And
rams'
skins
dyed
red,
and
badgers'
skins,
and
shittim
wood,
025:006
Oil
for
the
light,
spices
for
anointing
oil,
and
for
sweet
incense,
025:007
Onyx
stones,
and
stones
to
be
set
in
the
ephod,
and
in
the
breastplate.
025:008
And
let
them
make
me
a
sanctuary;
that
I
may
dwell
among
them.
025:009
According
to
all
that
I
shew
thee,
after
the
pattern
of
the
tabernacle,
and
the
pattern
of
all
the
instruments
thereof,
even
so
shall
ye
make
it.
025:010
And
they
shall
make
an
ark
of
shittim
wood:
two
cubits
and
a
half
shall
be
the
length
thereof,
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
the
breadth
thereof,
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
the
height
thereof.
025:011
And
thou
shalt
overlay
it
with
pure
gold,
within
and
without
shalt
thou
overlay
it,
and
shalt
make
upon
it
a
crown
of
gold
round
about.
025:012
And
thou
shalt
cast
four
rings
of
gold
for
it,
and
put
them
in
the
four
corners
thereof;
and
two
rings
shall
be
in
the
one
side
of
it,
and
two
rings
in
the
other
side
of
it.
025:013
And
thou
shalt
make
staves
of
shittim
wood,
and
overlay
them
with
gold.
025:014
And
thou
shalt
put
the
staves
into
the
rings
by
the
sides
of
the
ark,
that
the
ark
may
be
borne
with
them.
025:015
The
staves
shall
be
in
the
rings
of
the
ark:
they
shall
not
be
taken
from
it.
025:016
And
thou
shalt
put
into
the
ark
the
testimony
which
I
shall
give
thee.
025:017
And
thou
shalt
make
a
mercy
seat
of
pure
gold:
two
cubits
and
a
half
shall
be
the
length
thereof,
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
the
breadth
thereof.
025:018
And
thou
shalt
make
two
cherubims
of
gold,
of
beaten
work
shalt
thou
make
them,
in
the
two
ends
of
the
mercy
seat.
025:019
And
make
one
cherub
on
the
one
end,
and
the
other
cherub
on
the
other
end:
even
of
the
mercy
seat
shall
ye
make
the
cherubims
on
the
two
ends
thereof.
025:020
And
the
cherubims
shall
stretch
forth
their
wings
on
high,
covering
the
mercy
seat
with
their
wings,
and
their
faces
shall
look
one
to
another;
toward
the
mercy
seat
shall
the
faces
of
the
cherubims
be.
025:021
And
thou
shalt
put
the
mercy
seat
above
upon
the
ark;
and
in
the
ark
thou
shalt
put
the
testimony
that
I
shall
give
thee.
025:022
And
there
I
will
meet
with
thee,
and
I
will
commune
with
thee
from
above
the
mercy
seat,
from
between
the
two
cherubims
which
are
upon
the
ark
of
the
testimony,
of
all
things
which
I
will
give
thee
in
commandment
unto
the
children
of
Israel.
025:023
Thou
shalt
also
make
a
table
of
shittim
wood:
two
cubits
shall
be
the
length
thereof,
and
a
cubit
the
breadth
thereof,
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
the
height
thereof.
025:024
And
thou
shalt
overlay
it
with
pure
gold,
and
make
thereto
a
crown
of
gold
round
about.
025:025
And
thou
shalt
make
unto
it
a
border
of
an
hand
breadth
round
about,
and
thou
shalt
make
a
golden
crown
to
the
border
thereof
round
about.
025:026
And
thou
shalt
make
for
it
four
rings
of
gold,
and
put
the
rings
in
the
four
corners
that
are
on
the
four
feet
thereof.
025:027
Over
against
the
border
shall
the
rings
be
for
places
of
the
staves
to
bear
the
table.
025:028
And
thou
shalt
make
the
staves
of
shittim
wood,
and
overlay
them
with
gold,
that
the
table
may
be
borne
with
them.
025:029
And
thou
shalt
make
the
dishes
thereof,
and
spoons
thereof,
and
covers
thereof,
and
bowls
thereof,
to
cover
withal:
of
pure
gold
shalt
thou
make
them.
025:030
And
thou
shalt
set
upon
the
table
shewbread
before
me
alway.
025:031
And
thou
