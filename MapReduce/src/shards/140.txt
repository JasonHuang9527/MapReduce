people,
when
I
shall
bring
thy
destruction
among
the
nations,
into
the
countries
which
thou
hast
not
known.
032:010
Yea,
I
will
make
many
people
amazed
at
thee,
and
their
kings
shall
be
horribly
afraid
for
thee,
when
I
shall
brandish
my
sword
before
them;
and
they
shall
tremble
at
every
moment,
every
man
for
his
own
life,
in
the
day
of
thy
fall.
032:011
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
The
sword
of
the
king
of
Babylon
shall
come
upon
thee.
032:012
By
the
swords
of
the
mighty
will
I
cause
thy
multitude
to
fall,
the
terrible
of
the
nations,
all
of
them:
and
they
shall
spoil
the
pomp
of
Egypt,
and
all
the
multitude
thereof
shall
be
destroyed.
032:013
I
will
destroy
also
all
the
beasts
thereof
from
beside
the
great
waters;
neither
shall
the
foot
of
man
trouble
them
any
more,
nor
the
hoofs
of
beasts
trouble
them.
032:014
Then
will
I
make
their
waters
deep,
and
cause
their
rivers
to
run
like
oil,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
032:015
When
I
shall
make
the
land
of
Egypt
desolate,
and
the
country
shall
be
destitute
of
that
whereof
it
was
full,
when
I
shall
smite
all
them
that
dwell
therein,
then
shall
they
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
032:016
This
is
the
lamentation
wherewith
they
shall
lament
her:
the
daughters
of
the
nations
shall
lament
her:
they
shall
lament
for
her,
even
for
Egypt,
and
for
all
her
multitude,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
032:017
It
came
to
pass
also
in
the
twelfth
year,
in
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
032:018
Son
of
man,
wail
for
the
multitude
of
Egypt,
and
cast
them
down,
even
her,
and
the
daughters
of
the
famous
nations,
unto
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth,
with
them
that
go
down
into
the
pit.
032:019
Whom
dost
thou
pass
in
beauty?
go
down,
and
be
thou
laid
with
the
uncircumcised.
032:020
They
shall
fall
in
the
midst
of
them
that
are
slain
by
the
sword:
she
is
delivered
to
the
sword:
draw
her
and
all
her
multitudes.
032:021
The
strong
among
the
mighty
shall
speak
to
him
out
of
the
midst
of
hell
with
them
that
help
him:
they
are
gone
down,
they
lie
uncircumcised,
slain
by
the
sword.
032:022
Asshur
is
there
and
all
her
company:
his
graves
are
about
him:
all
of
them
slain,
fallen
by
the
sword:
032:023
Whose
graves
are
set
in
the
sides
of
the
pit,
and
her
company
is
round
about
her
grave:
all
of
them
slain,
fallen
by
the
sword,
which
caused
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living.
032:024
There
is
Elam
and
all
her
multitude
round
about
her
grave,
all
of
them
slain,
fallen
by
the
sword,
which
are
gone
down
uncircumcised
into
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth,
which
caused
their
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living;
yet
have
they
borne
their
shame
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit.
032:025
They
have
set
her
a
bed
in
the
midst
of
the
slain
with
all
her
multitude:
her
graves
are
round
about
him:
all
of
them
uncircumcised,
slain
by
the
sword:
though
their
terror
was
caused
in
the
land
of
the
living,
yet
have
they
borne
their
shame
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit:
he
is
put
in
the
midst
of
them
that
be
slain.
032:026
There
is
Meshech,
Tubal,
and
all
her
multitude:
her
graves
are
round
about
him:
all
of
them
uncircumcised,
slain
by
the
sword,
though
they
caused
their
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living.
032:027
And
they
shall
not
lie
with
the
mighty
that
are
fallen
of
the
uncircumcised,
which
are
gone
down
to
hell
with
their
weapons
of
war:
and
they
have
laid
their
swords
under
their
heads,
but
their
iniquities
shall
be
upon
their
bones,
though
they
were
the
terror
of
the
mighty
in
the
land
of
the
living.
032:028
Yea,
thou
shalt
be
broken
in
the
midst
of
the
uncircumcised,
and
shalt
lie
with
them
that
are
slain
with
the
sword.
032:029
There
is
Edom,
her
kings,
and
all
her
princes,
which
with
their
might
are
laid
by
them
that
were
slain
by
the
sword:
they
shall
lie
with
the
uncircumcised,
and
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit.
032:030
There
be
the
princes
of
the
north,
all
of
them,
and
all
the
Zidonians,
which
are
gone
down
with
the
slain;
with
their
terror
they
are
ashamed
of
their
might;
and
they
lie
uncircumcised
with
them
that
be
slain
by
the
sword,
and
bear
their
shame
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit.
032:031
Pharaoh
shall
see
them,
and
shall
be
comforted
over
all
his
multitude,
even
Pharaoh
and
all
his
army
slain
by
the
sword,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
032:032
For
I
have
caused
my
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living:
and
he
shall
be
laid
in
the
midst
of
the
uncircumcised
with
them
that
are
slain
with
the
sword,
even
Pharaoh
and
all
his
multitude,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
033:001
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
033:002
Son
of
man,
speak
to
the
children
of
thy
people,
and
say
unto
them,
When
I
bring
the
sword
upon
a
land,
if
the
people
of
the
land
take
a
man
of
their
coasts,
and
set
him
for
their
watchman:
033:003
If
when
he
seeth
the
sword
come
upon
the
land,
he
blow
the
trumpet,
and
warn
the
people;
033:004
Then
whosoever
heareth
the
sound
of
the
trumpet,
and
taketh
not
warning;
if
the
sword
come,
and
take
him
away,
his
blood
shall
be
upon
his
own
head.
033:005
He
heard
the
sound
of
the
trumpet,
and
took
not
warning;
his
blood
shall
be
upon
him.
But
he
that
taketh
warning
shall
deliver
his
soul.
033:006
But
if
the
watchman
see
the
sword
come,
and
blow
not
the
trumpet,
and
the
people
be
not
warned;
if
the
sword
come,
and
take
any
person
from
among
them,
he
is
taken
away
in
his
iniquity;
but
his
blood
will
I
require
at
the
watchman's
hand.
033:007
So
thou,
O
son
of
man,
I
have
set
thee
a
watchman
unto
the
house
of
Israel;
therefore
thou
shalt
hear
the
word
at
my
mouth,
and
warn
them
from
me.
033:008
When
I
say
unto
the
wicked,
O
wicked
man,
thou
shalt
surely
die;
if
thou
dost
not
speak
to
warn
the
wicked
from
his
way,
that
wicked
man
shall
die
in
his
iniquity;
but
his
blood
will
I
require
at
thine
hand.
033:009
Nevertheless,
if
thou
warn
the
wicked
of
his
way
to
turn
from
it;
if
he
do
not
turn
from
his
way,
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity;
but
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul.
033:010
Therefore,
O
thou
son
of
man,
speak
unto
the
house
of
Israel;
Thus
ye
speak,
saying,
If
our
transgressions
and
our
sins
be
upon
us,
and
we
pine
away
in
them,
how
should
we
then
live?
033:011
Say
unto
them,
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
I
have
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
the
wicked;
but
that
the
wicked
turn
from
his
way
and
live:
turn
ye,
turn
ye
from
your
evil
ways;
for
why
will
ye
die,
O
house
of
Israel?
033:012
Therefore,
thou
son
of
man,
say
unto
the
children
of
thy
people,
The
righteousness
of
the
righteous
shall
not
deliver
him
in
the
day
of
his
transgression:
as
for
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked,
he
shall
not
fall
thereby
in
the
day
that
he
turneth
from
his
wickedness;
neither
shall
the
righteous
be
able
to
live
for
his
righteousness
in
the
day
that
he
sinneth.
033:013
When
I
shall
say
to
the
righteous,
that
he
shall
surely
live;
if
he
trust
to
his
own
righteousness,
and
commit
iniquity,
all
his
righteousnesses
shall
not
be
remembered;
but
for
his
iniquity
that
he
hath
committed,
he
shall
die
for
it.
033:014
Again,
when
I
say
unto
the
wicked,
Thou
shalt
surely
die;
if
he
turn
from
his
sin,
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right;
033:015
If
the
wicked
restore
the
pledge,
give
again
that
he
had
robbed,
walk
in
the
statutes
of
life,
without
committing
iniquity;
he
shall
surely
live,
he
shall
not
die.
033:016
None
of
his
sins
that
he
hath
committed
shall
be
mentioned
unto
him:
he
hath
done
that
which
is
lawful
and
right;
he
shall
surely
live.
033:017
Yet
the
children
of
thy
people
say,
The
way
of
the
Lord
is
not
equal:
but
as
for
them,
their
way
is
not
equal.
033:018
When
the
righteous
turneth
from
his
righteousness,
and
committeth
iniquity,
he
shall
even
die
thereby.
033:019
But
if
the
wicked
turn
from
his
wickedness,
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right,
he
shall
live
thereby.
033:020
Yet
ye
say,
The
way
of
the
Lord
is
not
equal.
O
ye
house
of
Israel,
I
will
judge
you
every
one
after
his
ways.
033:021
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twelfth
year
of
our
captivity,
in
the
tenth
month,
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month,
that
one
that
had
escaped
out
of
Jerusalem
came
unto
me,
saying,
The
city
is
smitten.
033:022
Now
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
upon
me
in
the
evening,
afore
he
that
was
escaped
came;
and
had
opened
my
mouth,
until
he
came
to
me
in
the
morning;
and
my
mouth
was
opened,
and
I
was
no
more
dumb.
033:023
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
033:024
Son
of
man,
they
that
inhabit
those
wastes
of
the
land
of
Israel
speak,
saying,
Abraham
was
one,
and
he
inherited
the
land:
but
we
are
many;
the
land
is
given
us
for
inheritance.
033:025
Wherefore
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Ye
eat
with
the
blood,
and
lift
up
your
eyes
toward
your
idols,
and
shed
blood:
and
shall
ye
possess
the
land?
033:026
Ye
stand
upon
your
sword,
ye
work
abomination,
and
ye
defile
every
one
his
neighbour's
wife:
and
shall
ye
possess
the
land?
033:027
Say
thou
thus
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
As
I
live,
surely
they
that
are
in
the
wastes
shall
fall
by
the
sword,
and
him
that
is
in
the
open
field
will
I
give
to
the
beasts
to
be
devoured,
and
they
that
be
in
the
forts
and
in
the
caves
shall
die
of
the
pestilence.
033:028
For
I
will
lay
the
land
most
desolate,
and
the
pomp
of
her
strength
shall
cease;
and
the
mountains
of
Israel
shall
be
desolate,
that
none
shall
pass
through.
033:029
Then
shall
they
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
have
laid
the
land
most
desolate
because
of
all
their
abominations
which
they
have
committed.
033:030
Also,
thou
son
of
man,
the
children
of
thy
people
still
are
talking
against
thee
by
the
walls
and
in
the
doors
of
the
houses,
and
speak
one
to
another,
every
one
to
his
brother,
saying,
Come,
I
pray
you,
and
hear
what
is
the
word
that
cometh
forth
from
the
LORD.
033:031
And
they
come
unto
thee
as
the
people
cometh,
and
they
sit
before
thee
as
my
people,
and
they
hear
thy
words,
but
they
will
not
do
them:
for
with
their
mouth
they
shew
much
love,
but
their
heart
goeth
after
their
covetousness.
033:032
And,
lo,
thou
art
unto
them
as
a
very
lovely
song
of
one
that
hath
a
pleasant
voice,
and
can
play
well
on
an
instrument:
for
they
hear
thy
words,
but
they
do
them
not.
033:033
And
when
this
cometh
to
pass,
(lo,
it
will
come,)
then
shall
they
know
that
a
prophet
hath
been
among
them.
034:001
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
034:002
Son
of
man,
prophesy
against
the
shepherds
of
Israel,
prophesy,
and
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
unto
the
shepherds;
Woe
be
to
the
shepherds
of
Israel
that
do
feed
themselves!
should
not
the
shepherds
feed
the
flocks?
034:003
Ye
eat
the
fat,
and
ye
clothe
you
with
the
wool,
ye
kill
them
that
are
fed:
but
ye
feed
not
the
flock.
034:004
The
diseased
have
ye
not
strengthened,
neither
have
ye
healed
that
which
was
sick,
neither
have
ye
bound
up
that
which
was
broken,
neither
have
ye
brought
again
that
which
was
driven
away,
neither
have
ye
sought
that
which
was
lost;
but
with
force
and
with
cruelty
have
ye
ruled
them.
034:005
And
they
were
scattered,
because
there
is
no
shepherd:
and
they
became
meat
to
all
the
beasts
of
the
field,
when
they
were
scattered.
034:006
My
sheep
wandered
through
all
the
mountains,
and
upon
every
high
hill:
yea,
my
flock
was
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
none
did
search
or
seek
after
them.
034:007
Therefore,
ye
shepherds,
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD;
034:008
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
surely
because
my
flock
became
a
prey,
and
my
flock
became
meat
to
every
beast
of
the
field,
because
there
was
no
shepherd,
neither
did
my
shepherds
search
for
my
flock,
but
the
shepherds
fed
themselves,
and
fed
not
my
flock;
034:009
Therefore,
O
ye
shepherds,
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD;
034:010
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
am
against
the
shepherds;
and
I
will
require
my
flock
at
their
hand,
and
cause
them
to
cease
from
feeding
the
flock;
neither
shall
the
shepherds
feed
themselves
any
more;
for
I
will
deliver
my
flock
from
their
mouth,
that
they
may
not
be
meat
for
them.
034:011
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I,
even
I,
will
both
search
my
sheep,
and
seek
them
out.
034:012
As
a
shepherd
seeketh
out
his
flock
in
the
day
that
he
is
among
his
sheep
that
are
scattered;
so
will
I
seek
out
my
sheep,
and
will
deliver
them
out
of
all
places
where
they
have
been
scattered
in
the
cloudy
and
dark
day.
034:013
And
I
will
bring
them
out
from
the
people,
and
gather
them
from
the
countries,
and
will
bring
them
to
their
own
land,
and
feed
them
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel
by
the
rivers,
and
in
all
the
inhabited
places
of
the
country.
034:014
I
will
feed
them
in
a
good
pasture,
and
upon
the
high
mountains
of
Israel
shall
their
fold
be:
there
shall
they
lie
in
a
good
fold,
and
in
a
fat
pasture
shall
they
feed
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel.
034:015
I
will
feed
my
flock,
and
I
will
cause
them
to
lie
down,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
034:016
I
will
seek
that
which
was
lost,
and
bring
again
that
which
was
driven
away,
and
will
bind
up
that
which
was
broken,
and
will
strengthen
that
which
was
sick:
but
I
will
destroy
the
fat
and
the
strong;
I
will
feed
them
with
judgment.
034:017
And
as
for
you,
O
my
flock,
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
judge
between
cattle
and
cattle,
between
the
rams
and
the
he
goats.
034:018
Seemeth
it
a
small
thing
unto
you
to
have
eaten
up
the
good
pasture,
but
ye
must
tread
down
with
your
feet
the
residue
of
your
pastures?
and
to
have
drunk
of
the
deep
waters,
but
ye
must
foul
the
residue
with
your
feet?
034:019
And
as
for
my
flock,
they
eat
that
which
ye
have
trodden
with
your
feet;
and
they
drink
that
which
ye
have
fouled
with
your
feet.
034:020
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
unto
them;
Behold,
I,
even
I,
will
judge
between
the
fat
cattle
and
between
the
lean
cattle.
034:021
Because
ye
have
thrust
with
side
and
with
shoulder,
and
pushed
all
the
diseased
with
your
horns,
till
ye
have
scattered
them
abroad;
034:022
Therefore
will
I
save
my
flock,
and
they
shall
no
more
be
a
prey;
and
I
will
judge
between
cattle
and
cattle.
034:023
And
I
will
set
up
one
shepherd
over
them,
and
he
shall
feed
them,
even
my
servant
David;
he
shall
feed
them,
and
he
shall
be
their
shepherd.
034:024
And
I
the
LORD
will
be
their
God,
and
my
servant
David
a
prince
among
them;
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it.
034:025
And
I
will
make
with
them
a
covenant
of
peace,
and
will
cause
the
evil
beasts
to
cease
out
of
the
land:
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
in
the
wilderness,
and
sleep
in
the
woods.
034:026
And
I
will
make
them
and
the
places
round
about
my
hill
a
blessing;
and
I
will
cause
the
shower
to
come
down
in
his
season;
there
shall
be
showers
of
blessing.
034:027
And
the
tree
of
the
field
shall
yield
her
fruit,
and
the
earth
shall
yield
her
increase,
and
they
shall
be
safe
in
their
land,
and
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
have
broken
the
bands
of
their
yoke,
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
those
that
served
themselves
of
them.
034:028
And
they
shall
no
more
be
a
prey
to
the
heathen,
neither
shall
the
beast
of
the
land
devour
them;
but
they
shall
dwell
safely,
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid.
034:029
And
I
will
raise
up
for
them
a
plant
of
renown,
and
they
shall
be
no
more
consumed
with
hunger
in
the
land,
neither
bear
the
shame
of
the
heathen
any
more.
034:030
Thus
shall
they
know
that
I
the
LORD
their
God
am
with
them,
and
that
they,
even
the
house
of
Israel,
are
my
people,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
034:031
And
ye
my
flock,
the
flock
of
my
pasture,
are
men,
and
I
am
your
God,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
035:001
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
035:002
Son
of
man,
set
thy
face
against
mount
Seir,
and
prophesy
against
it,
035:003
And
say
unto
it,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
O
mount
Seir,
I
am
against
thee,
and
I
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
against
thee,
and
I
will
make
thee
most
desolate.
035:004
I
will
lay
thy
cities
waste,
and
thou
shalt
be
desolate,
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
035:005
Because
thou
hast
had
a
perpetual
hatred,
and
hast
shed
the
blood
of
the
children
of
Israel
by
the
force
of
the
sword
in
the
time
of
their
calamity,
in
the
time
that
their
iniquity
had
an
end:
035:006
Therefore,
as
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
I
will
prepare
thee
unto
blood,
and
blood
shall
pursue
thee:
sith
thou
hast
not
hated
blood,
even
blood
shall
pursue
thee.
035:007
Thus
will
I
make
mount
Seir
most
desolate,
and
cut
off
from
it
him
that
passeth
out
and
him
that
returneth.
035:008
And
I
will
fill
his
mountains
with
his
slain
men:
in
thy
hills,
and
in
thy
valleys,
and
in
all
thy
rivers,
shall
they
fall
that
are
slain
with
the
sword.
035:009
I
will
make
thee
perpetual
desolations,
and
thy
cities
shall
not
return:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
035:010
Because
thou
hast
said,
These
two
nations
and
these
two
countries
shall
be
mine,
and
we
will
possess
it;
whereas
the
LORD
was
there:
035:011
Therefore,
as
I
live,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
I
will
even
do
according
to
thine
anger,
and
according
to
thine
envy
which
thou
hast
used
out
of
thy
hatred
against
them;
and
I
will
make
myself
known
among
them,
when
I
have
judged
thee.
035:012
And
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
and
that
I
have
heard
all
thy
blasphemies
which
thou
hast
spoken
against
the
mountains
of
Israel,
saying,
They
are
laid
desolate,
they
are
given
us
to
consume.
035:013
Thus
with
your
mouth
ye
have
boasted
against
me,
and
have
multiplied
your
words
against
me:
I
have
heard
them.
035:014
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
When
the
whole
earth
rejoiceth,
I
will
make
thee
desolate.
035:015
As
thou
didst
rejoice
at
the
inheritance
of
the
house
of
Israel,
because
it
was
desolate,
so
will
I
do
unto
thee:
thou
shalt
be
desolate,
O
mount
Seir,
and
all
Idumea,
even
all
of
it:
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
036:001
Also,
thou
son
of
man,
prophesy
unto
the
mountains
of
Israel,
and
say,
Ye
mountains
of
Israel,
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD:
036:002
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
the
enemy
hath
said
against
you,
Aha,
even
the
ancient
high
places
are
ours
in
possession:
036:003
Therefore
prophesy
and
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
they
have
made
you
desolate,
and
swallowed
you
up
on
every
side,
that
ye
might
be
a
possession
unto
the
residue
of
the
heathen,
and
ye
are
taken
up
in
the
lips
of
talkers,
and
are
an
infamy
of
the
people:
036:004
Therefore,
ye
mountains
of
Israel,
hear
the
word
of
the
Lord
GOD;
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
to
the
mountains,
and
to
the
hills,
to
the
rivers,
and
to
the
valleys,
to
the
desolate
wastes,
and
to
the
cities
that
are
forsaken,
which
became
a
prey
and
derision
to
the
residue
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about;
036:005
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Surely
in
the
fire
of
my
jealousy
have
I
spoken
against
the
residue
of
the
heathen,
and
against
all
Idumea,
which
have
appointed
my
land
into
their
possession
with
the
joy
of
all
their
heart,
with
despiteful
minds,
to
cast
it
out
for
a
prey.
036:006
Prophesy
therefore
concerning
the
land
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
the
mountains,
and
to
the
hills,
to
the
rivers,
and
to
the
valleys,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
have
spoken
in
my
jealousy
and
in
my
fury,
because
ye
have
borne
the
shame
of
the
heathen:
036:007
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
have
lifted
up
mine
hand,
Surely
the
heathen
that
are
about
you,
they
shall
bear
their
shame.
036:008
But
ye,
O
mountains
of
Israel,
ye
shall
shoot
forth
your
branches,
and
yield
your
fruit
to
my
people
of
Israel;
for
they
are
at
hand
to
come.
036:009
For,
behold,
I
am
for
you,
and
I
will
turn
unto
you,
and
ye
shall
be
tilled
and
sown:
036:010
And
I
will
multiply
men
upon
you,
all
the
house
of
Israel,
even
all
of
it:
and
the
cities
shall
be
inhabited,
and
the
wastes
shall
be
builded:
036:011
And
I
will
multiply
upon
you
man
and
beast;
and
they
shall
increase
and
bring
fruit:
and
I
will
settle
you
after
your
old
estates,
and
will
do
better
unto
you
than
at
your
beginnings:
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
036:012
Yea,
I
will
cause
men
to
walk
upon
you,
even
my
people
Israel;
and
they
shall
possess
thee,
and
thou
shalt
be
their
inheritance,
and
thou
shalt
no
more
henceforth
bereave
them
of
men.
036:013
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Because
they
say
unto
you,
Thou
land
devourest
up
men,
and
hast
bereaved
thy
nations:
036:014
Therefore
thou
shalt
devour
men
no
more,
neither
bereave
thy
nations
any
more,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
036:015
Neither
will
I
cause
men
to
hear
in
thee
the
shame
of
the
heathen
any
more,
neither
shalt
thou
bear
the
reproach
of
the
people
any
more,
neither
shalt
thou
cause
thy
nations
to
fall
any
more,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
036:016
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
036:017
Son
of
man,
when
the
house
of
Israel
dwelt
in
their
own
land,
they
defiled
it
by
their
own
way
and
by
their
doings:
their
way
was
before
me
as
the
uncleanness
of
a
removed
woman.
036:018
Wherefore
I
poured
my
fury
upon
them
for
the
blood
that
they
had
shed
upon
the
land,
and
for
their
idols
wherewith
they
had
polluted
it:
036:019
And
I
scattered
them
among
the
heathen,
and
they
were
dispersed
through
the
countries:
according
to
their
way
and
according
to
their
doings
I
judged
them.
036:020
And
when
they
entered
unto
the
heathen,
whither
they
went,
they
profaned
my
holy
name,
when
they
said
to
them,
These
are
the
people
of
the
LORD,
and
are
gone
forth
out
of
his
land.
036:021
But
I
had
pity
for
mine
holy
name,
which
the
house
of
Israel
had
profaned
among
the
heathen,
whither
they
went.
036:022
Therefore
say
unto
the
house
of
Israel,
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
do
not
this
for
your
sakes,
O
house
of
Israel,
but
for
mine
holy
name's
sake,
which
ye
have
profaned
among
the
heathen,
whither
ye
went.
036:023
And
I
will
sanctify
my
great
name,
which
was
profaned
among
the
heathen,
which
ye
have
profaned
in
the
