midst
of
them;
and
the
heathen
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
when
I
shall
be
sanctified
in
you
before
their
eyes.
036:024
For
I
will
take
you
from
among
the
heathen,
and
gather
you
out
of
all
countries,
and
will
bring
you
into
your
own
land.
036:025
Then
will
I
sprinkle
clean
water
upon
you,
and
ye
shall
be
clean:
from
all
your
filthiness,
and
from
all
your
idols,
will
I
cleanse
you.
036:026
A
new
heart
also
will
I
give
you,
and
a
new
spirit
will
I
put
within
you:
and
I
will
take
away
the
stony
heart
out
of
your
flesh,
and
I
will
give
you
an
heart
of
flesh.
036:027
And
I
will
put
my
spirit
within
you,
and
cause
you
to
walk
in
my
statutes,
and
ye
shall
keep
my
judgments,
and
do
them.
036:028
And
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
land
that
I
gave
to
your
fathers;
and
ye
shall
be
my
people,
and
I
will
be
your
God.
036:029
I
will
also
save
you
from
all
your
uncleannesses:
and
I
will
call
for
the
corn,
and
will
increase
it,
and
lay
no
famine
upon
you.
036:030
And
I
will
multiply
the
fruit
of
the
tree,
and
the
increase
of
the
field,
that
ye
shall
receive
no
more
reproach
of
famine
among
the
heathen.
036:031
Then
shall
ye
remember
your
own
evil
ways,
and
your
doings
that
were
not
good,
and
shall
lothe
yourselves
in
your
own
sight
for
your
iniquities
and
for
your
abominations.
036:032
Not
for
your
sakes
do
I
this,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
be
it
known
unto
you:
be
ashamed
and
confounded
for
your
own
ways,
O
house
of
Israel.
036:033
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
In
the
day
that
I
shall
have
cleansed
you
from
all
your
iniquities
I
will
also
cause
you
to
dwell
in
the
cities,
and
the
wastes
shall
be
builded.
036:034
And
the
desolate
land
shall
be
tilled,
whereas
it
lay
desolate
in
the
sight
of
all
that
passed
by.
036:035
And
they
shall
say,
This
land
that
was
desolate
is
become
like
the
garden
of
Eden;
and
the
waste
and
desolate
and
ruined
cities
are
become
fenced,
and
are
inhabited.
036:036
Then
the
heathen
that
are
left
round
about
you
shall
know
that
I
the
LORD
build
the
ruined
places,
and
plant
that
that
was
desolate:
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it,
and
I
will
do
it.
036:037
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
I
will
yet
for
this
be
enquired
of
by
the
house
of
Israel,
to
do
it
for
them;
I
will
increase
them
with
men
like
a
flock.
036:038
As
the
holy
flock,
as
the
flock
of
Jerusalem
in
her
solemn
feasts;
so
shall
the
waste
cities
be
filled
with
flocks
of
men:
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
037:001
The
hand
of
the
LORD
was
upon
me,
and
carried
me
out
in
the
spirit
of
the
LORD,
and
set
me
down
in
the
midst
of
the
valley
which
was
full
of
bones,
037:002
And
caused
me
to
pass
by
them
round
about:
and,
behold,
there
were
very
many
in
the
open
valley;
and,
lo,
they
were
very
dry.
037:003
And
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
can
these
bones
live?
And
I
answered,
O
Lord
GOD,
thou
knowest.
037:004
Again
he
said
unto
me,
Prophesy
upon
these
bones,
and
say
unto
them,
O
ye
dry
bones,
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD.
037:005
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
unto
these
bones;
Behold,
I
will
cause
breath
to
enter
into
you,
and
ye
shall
live:
037:006
And
I
will
lay
sinews
upon
you,
and
will
bring
up
flesh
upon
you,
and
cover
you
with
skin,
and
put
breath
in
you,
and
ye
shall
live;
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
037:007
So
I
prophesied
as
I
was
commanded:
and
as
I
prophesied,
there
was
a
noise,
and
behold
a
shaking,
and
the
bones
came
together,
bone
to
his
bone.
037:008
And
when
I
beheld,
lo,
the
sinews
and
the
flesh
came
up
upon
them,
and
the
skin
covered
them
above:
but
there
was
no
breath
in
them.
037:009
Then
said
he
unto
me,
Prophesy
unto
the
wind,
prophesy,
son
of
man,
and
say
to
the
wind,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Come
from
the
four
winds,
O
breath,
and
breathe
upon
these
slain,
that
they
may
live.
037:010
So
I
prophesied
as
he
commanded
me,
and
the
breath
came
into
them,
and
they
lived,
and
stood
up
upon
their
feet,
an
exceeding
great
army.
037:011
Then
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
these
bones
are
the
whole
house
of
Israel:
behold,
they
say,
Our
bones
are
dried,
and
our
hope
is
lost:
we
are
cut
off
for
our
parts.
037:012
Therefore
prophesy
and
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
O
my
people,
I
will
open
your
graves,
and
cause
you
to
come
up
out
of
your
graves,
and
bring
you
into
the
land
of
Israel.
037:013
And
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
when
I
have
opened
your
graves,
O
my
people,
and
brought
you
up
out
of
your
graves,
037:014
And
shall
put
my
spirit
in
you,
and
ye
shall
live,
and
I
shall
place
you
in
your
own
land:
then
shall
ye
know
that
I
the
LORD
have
spoken
it,
and
performed
it,
saith
the
LORD.
037:015
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
unto
me,
saying,
037:016
Moreover,
thou
son
of
man,
take
thee
one
stick,
and
write
upon
it,
For
Judah,
and
for
the
children
of
Israel
his
companions:
then
take
another
stick,
and
write
upon
it,
For
Joseph,
the
stick
of
Ephraim
and
for
all
the
house
of
Israel
his
companions:
037:017
And
join
them
one
to
another
into
one
stick;
and
they
shall
become
one
in
thine
hand.
037:018
And
when
the
children
of
thy
people
shall
speak
unto
thee,
saying,
Wilt
thou
not
shew
us
what
thou
meanest
by
these?
037:019
Say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
take
the
stick
of
Joseph,
which
is
in
the
hand
of
Ephraim,
and
the
tribes
of
Israel
his
fellows,
and
will
put
them
with
him,
even
with
the
stick
of
Judah,
and
make
them
one
stick,
and
they
shall
be
one
in
mine
hand.
037:020
And
the
sticks
whereon
thou
writest
shall
be
in
thine
hand
before
their
eyes.
037:021
And
say
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
will
take
the
children
of
Israel
from
among
the
heathen,
whither
they
be
gone,
and
will
gather
them
on
every
side,
and
bring
them
into
their
own
land:
037:022
And
I
will
make
them
one
nation
in
the
land
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel;
and
one
king
shall
be
king
to
them
all:
and
they
shall
be
no
more
two
nations,
neither
shall
they
be
divided
into
two
kingdoms
any
more
at
all.
037:023
Neither
shall
they
defile
themselves
any
more
with
their
idols,
nor
with
their
detestable
things,
nor
with
any
of
their
transgressions:
but
I
will
save
them
out
of
all
their
dwellingplaces,
wherein
they
have
sinned,
and
will
cleanse
them:
so
shall
they
be
my
people,
and
I
will
be
their
God.
037:024
And
David
my
servant
shall
be
king
over
them;
and
they
all
shall
have
one
shepherd:
they
shall
also
walk
in
my
judgments,
and
observe
my
statutes,
and
do
them.
037:025
And
they
shall
dwell
in
the
land
that
I
have
given
unto
Jacob
my
servant,
wherein
your
fathers
have
dwelt;
and
they
shall
dwell
therein,
even
they,
and
their
children,
and
their
children's
children
for
ever:
and
my
servant
David
shall
be
their
prince
for
ever.
037:026
Moreover
I
will
make
a
covenant
of
peace
with
them;
it
shall
be
an
everlasting
covenant
with
them:
and
I
will
place
them,
and
multiply
them,
and
will
set
my
sanctuary
in
the
midst
of
them
for
evermore.
037:027
My
tabernacle
also
shall
be
with
them:
yea,
I
will
be
their
God,
and
they
shall
be
my
people.
037:028
And
the
heathen
shall
know
that
I
the
LORD
do
sanctify
Israel,
when
my
sanctuary
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
them
for
evermore.
038:001
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
038:002
Son
of
man,
set
thy
face
against
Gog,
the
land
of
Magog,
the
chief
prince
of
Meshech
and
Tubal,
and
prophesy
against
him,
038:003
And
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
O
Gog,
the
chief
prince
of
Meshech
and
Tubal:
038:004
And
I
will
turn
thee
back,
and
put
hooks
into
thy
jaws,
and
I
will
bring
thee
forth,
and
all
thine
army,
horses
and
horsemen,
all
of
them
clothed
with
all
sorts
of
armour,
even
a
great
company
with
bucklers
and
shields,
all
of
them
handling
swords:
038:005
Persia,
Ethiopia,
and
Libya
with
them;
all
of
them
with
shield
and
helmet:
038:006
Gomer,
and
all
his
bands;
the
house
of
Togarmah
of
the
north
quarters,
and
all
his
bands:
and
many
people
with
thee.
038:007
Be
thou
prepared,
and
prepare
for
thyself,
thou,
and
all
thy
company
that
are
assembled
unto
thee,
and
be
thou
a
guard
unto
them.
038:008
After
many
days
thou
shalt
be
visited:
in
the
latter
years
thou
shalt
come
into
the
land
that
is
brought
back
from
the
sword,
and
is
gathered
out
of
many
people,
against
the
mountains
of
Israel,
which
have
been
always
waste:
but
it
is
brought
forth
out
of
the
nations,
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
all
of
them.
038:009
Thou
shalt
ascend
and
come
like
a
storm,
thou
shalt
be
like
a
cloud
to
cover
the
land,
thou,
and
all
thy
bands,
and
many
people
with
thee.
038:010
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
It
shall
also
come
to
pass,
that
at
the
same
time
shall
things
come
into
thy
mind,
and
thou
shalt
think
an
evil
thought:
038:011
And
thou
shalt
say,
I
will
go
up
to
the
land
of
unwalled
villages;
I
will
go
to
them
that
are
at
rest,
that
dwell
safely,
all
of
them
dwelling
without
walls,
and
having
neither
bars
nor
gates,
038:012
To
take
a
spoil,
and
to
take
a
prey;
to
turn
thine
hand
upon
the
desolate
places
that
are
now
inhabited,
and
upon
the
people
that
are
gathered
out
of
the
nations,
which
have
gotten
cattle
and
goods,
that
dwell
in
the
midst
of
the
land.
038:013
Sheba,
and
Dedan,
and
the
merchants
of
Tarshish,
with
all
the
young
lions
thereof,
shall
say
unto
thee,
Art
thou
come
to
take
a
spoil?
hast
thou
gathered
thy
company
to
take
a
prey?
to
carry
away
silver
and
gold,
to
take
away
cattle
and
goods,
to
take
a
great
spoil?
038:014
Therefore,
son
of
man,
prophesy
and
say
unto
Gog,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
In
that
day
when
my
people
of
Israel
dwelleth
safely,
shalt
thou
not
know
it?
038:015
And
thou
shalt
come
from
thy
place
out
of
the
north
parts,
thou,
and
many
people
with
thee,
all
of
them
riding
upon
horses,
a
great
company,
and
a
mighty
army:
038:016
And
thou
shalt
come
up
against
my
people
of
Israel,
as
a
cloud
to
cover
the
land;
it
shall
be
in
the
latter
days,
and
I
will
bring
thee
against
my
land,
that
the
heathen
may
know
me,
when
I
shall
be
sanctified
in
thee,
O
Gog,
before
their
eyes.
038:017
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Art
thou
he
of
whom
I
have
spoken
in
old
time
by
my
servants
the
prophets
of
Israel,
which
prophesied
in
those
days
many
years
that
I
would
bring
thee
against
them?
038:018
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
at
the
same
time
when
Gog
shall
come
against
the
land
of
Israel,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
that
my
fury
shall
come
up
in
my
face.
038:019
For
in
my
jealousy
and
in
the
fire
of
my
wrath
have
I
spoken,
Surely
in
that
day
there
shall
be
a
great
shaking
in
the
land
of
Israel;
038:020
So
that
the
fishes
of
the
sea,
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven,
and
the
beasts
of
the
field,
and
all
creeping
things
that
creep
upon
the
earth,
and
all
the
men
that
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth,
shall
shake
at
my
presence,
and
the
mountains
shall
be
thrown
down,
and
the
steep
places
shall
fall,
and
every
wall
shall
fall
to
the
ground.
038:021
And
I
will
call
for
a
sword
against
him
throughout
all
my
mountains,
saith
the
Lord
GOD:
every
man's
sword
shall
be
against
his
brother.
038:022
And
I
will
plead
against
him
with
pestilence
and
with
blood;
and
I
will
rain
upon
him,
and
upon
his
bands,
and
upon
the
many
people
that
are
with
him,
an
overflowing
rain,
and
great
hailstones,
fire,
and
brimstone.
038:023
Thus
will
I
magnify
myself,
and
sanctify
myself;
and
I
will
be
known
in
the
eyes
of
many
nations,
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
039:001
Therefore,
thou
son
of
man,
prophesy
against
Gog,
and
say,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
O
Gog,
the
chief
prince
of
Meshech
and
Tubal:
039:002
And
I
will
turn
thee
back,
and
leave
but
the
sixth
part
of
thee,
and
will
cause
thee
to
come
up
from
the
north
parts,
and
will
bring
thee
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel:
039:003
And
I
will
smite
thy
bow
out
of
thy
left
hand,
and
will
cause
thine
arrows
to
fall
out
of
thy
right
hand.
039:004
Thou
shalt
fall
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel,
thou,
and
all
thy
bands,
and
the
people
that
is
with
thee:
I
will
give
thee
unto
the
ravenous
birds
of
every
sort,
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
to
be
devoured.
039:005
Thou
shalt
fall
upon
the
open
field:
for
I
have
spoken
it,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
039:006
And
I
will
send
a
fire
on
Magog,
and
among
them
that
dwell
carelessly
in
the
isles:
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD.
039:007
So
will
I
make
my
holy
name
known
in
the
midst
of
my
people
Israel;
and
I
will
not
let
them
pollute
my
holy
name
any
more:
and
the
heathen
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD,
the
Holy
One
in
Israel.
039:008
Behold,
it
is
come,
and
it
is
done,
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
this
is
the
day
whereof
I
have
spoken.
039:009
And
they
that
dwell
in
the
cities
of
Israel
shall
go
forth,
and
shall
set
on
fire
and
burn
the
weapons,
both
the
shields
and
the
bucklers,
the
bows
and
the
arrows,
and
the
handstaves,
and
the
spears,
and
they
shall
burn
them
with
fire
seven
years:
039:010
So
that
they
shall
take
no
wood
out
of
the
field,
neither
cut
down
any
out
of
the
forests;
for
they
shall
burn
the
weapons
with
fire:
and
they
shall
spoil
those
that
spoiled
them,
and
rob
those
that
robbed
them,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
039:011
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
I
will
give
unto
Gog
a
place
there
of
graves
in
Israel,
the
valley
of
the
passengers
on
the
east
of
the
sea:
and
it
shall
stop
the
noses
of
the
passengers:
and
there
shall
they
bury
Gog
and
all
his
multitude:
and
they
shall
call
it
The
valley
of
Hamongog.
039:012
And
seven
months
shall
the
house
of
Israel
be
burying
of
them,
that
they
may
cleanse
the
land.
039:013
Yea,
all
the
people
of
the
land
shall
bury
them;
and
it
shall
be
to
them
a
renown
the
day
that
I
shall
be
glorified,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
039:014
And
they
shall
sever
out
men
of
continual
employment,
passing
through
the
land
to
bury
with
the
passengers
those
that
remain
upon
the
face
of
the
earth,
to
cleanse
it:
after
the
end
of
seven
months
shall
they
search.
039:015
And
the
passengers
that
pass
through
the
land,
when
any
seeth
a
man's
bone,
then
shall
he
set
up
a
sign
by
it,
till
the
buriers
have
buried
it
in
the
valley
of
Hamongog.
039:016
And
also
the
name
of
the
city
shall
be
Hamonah.
Thus
shall
they
cleanse
the
land.
039:017
And,
thou
son
of
man,
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Speak
unto
every
feathered
fowl,
and
to
every
beast
of
the
field,
Assemble
yourselves,
and
come;
gather
yourselves
on
every
side
to
my
sacrifice
that
I
do
sacrifice
for
you,
even
a
great
sacrifice
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel,
that
ye
may
eat
flesh,
and
drink
blood.
039:018
Ye
shall
eat
the
flesh
of
the
mighty,
and
drink
the
blood
of
the
princes
of
the
earth,
of
rams,
of
lambs,
and
of
goats,
of
bullocks,
all
of
them
fatlings
of
Bashan.
039:019
And
ye
shall
eat
fat
till
ye
be
full,
and
drink
blood
till
ye
be
drunken,
of
my
sacrifice
which
I
have
sacrificed
for
you.
039:020
Thus
ye
shall
be
filled
at
my
table
with
horses
and
chariots,
with
mighty
men,
and
with
all
men
of
war,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
039:021
And
I
will
set
my
glory
among
the
heathen,
and
all
the
heathen
shall
see
my
judgment
that
I
have
executed,
and
my
hand
that
I
have
laid
upon
them.
039:022
So
the
house
of
Israel
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
their
God
from
that
day
and
forward.
039:023
And
the
heathen
shall
know
that
the
house
of
Israel
went
into
captivity
for
their
iniquity:
because
they
trespassed
against
me,
therefore
hid
I
my
face
from
them,
and
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies:
so
fell
they
all
by
the
sword.
039:024
According
to
their
uncleanness
and
according
to
their
transgressions
have
I
done
unto
them,
and
hid
my
face
from
them.
039:025
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Now
will
I
bring
again
the
captivity
of
Jacob,
and
have
mercy
upon
the
whole
house
of
Israel,
and
will
be
jealous
for
my
holy
name;
039:026
After
that
they
have
borne
their
shame,
and
all
their
trespasses
whereby
they
have
trespassed
against
me,
when
they
dwelt
safely
in
their
land,
and
none
made
them
afraid.
039:027
When
I
have
brought
them
again
from
the
people,
and
gathered
them
out
of
their
enemies'
lands,
and
am
sanctified
in
them
in
the
sight
of
many
nations;
039:028
Then
shall
they
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
their
God,
which
caused
them
to
be
led
into
captivity
among
the
heathen:
but
I
have
gathered
them
unto
their
own
land,
and
have
left
none
of
them
any
more
there.
039:029
Neither
will
I
hide
my
face
any
more
from
them:
for
I
have
poured
out
my
spirit
upon
the
house
of
Israel,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
040:001
In
the
five
and
twentieth
year
of
our
captivity,
in
the
beginning
of
the
year,
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month,
in
the
fourteenth
year
after
that
the
city
was
smitten,
in
the
selfsame
day
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
upon
me,
and
brought
me
thither.
040:002
In
the
visions
of
God
brought
he
me
into
the
land
of
Israel,
and
set
me
upon
a
very
high
mountain,
by
which
was
as
the
frame
of
a
city
on
the
south.
040:003
And
he
brought
me
thither,
and,
behold,
there
was
a
man,
whose
appearance
was
like
the
appearance
of
brass,
with
a
line
of
flax
in
his
hand,
and
a
measuring
reed;
and
he
stood
in
the
gate.
040:004
And
the
man
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
behold
with
thine
eyes,
and
hear
with
thine
ears,
and
set
thine
heart
upon
all
that
I
shall
shew
thee;
for
to
the
intent
that
I
might
shew
them
unto
thee
art
thou
brought
hither:
declare
all
that
thou
seest
to
the
house
of
Israel.
040:005
And
behold
a
wall
on
the
outside
of
the
house
round
about,
and
in
the
man's
hand
a
measuring
reed
of
six
cubits
long
by
the
cubit
and
an
hand
breadth:
so
he
measured
the
breadth
of
the
building,
one
reed;
and
the
height,
one
reed.
040:006
Then
came
he
unto
the
gate
which
looketh
toward
the
east,
and
went
up
the
stairs
thereof,
and
measured
the
threshold
of
the
gate,
which
was
one
reed
broad;
and
the
other
threshold
of
the
gate,
which
was
one
reed
broad.
040:007
And
every
little
chamber
was
one
reed
long,
and
one
reed
broad;
and
between
the
little
chambers
were
five
cubits;
and
the
threshold
of
the
gate
by
the
porch
of
the
gate
within
was
one
reed.
040:008
He
measured
also
the
porch
of
the
gate
within,
one
reed.
040:009
Then
measured
he
the
porch
of
the
gate,
eight
cubits;
and
the
posts
thereof,
two
cubits;
and
the
porch
of
the
gate
was
inward.
040:010
And
the
little
chambers
of
the
gate
eastward
were
three
on
this
side,
and
three
on
that
side;
they
three
were
of
one
measure:
and
the
posts
had
one
measure
on
this
side
and
on
that
side.
040:011
And
he
measured
the
breadth
of
the
entry
of
the
gate,
ten
cubits;
and
the
length
of
the
gate,
thirteen
cubits.
040:012
The
space
also
before
the
little
chambers
was
one
cubit
on
this
side,
and
the
space
was
one
cubit
on
that
side:
and
the
little
chambers
were
six
cubits
on
this
side,
and
six
cubits
on
that
side.
040:013
He
measured
then
the
gate
from
the
roof
of
one
little
chamber
to
the
roof
of
another:
the
breadth
was
five
and
twenty
cubits,
door
against
door.
040:014
He
made
also
posts
of
threescore
cubits,
even
unto
the
post
of
the
court
round
about
the
gate.
040:015
And
from
the
face
of
the
gate
of
the
entrance
unto
the
face
of
the
porch
of
the
inner
gate
were
fifty
cubits.
040:016
And
there
were
narrow
windows
to
the
little
chambers,
and
to
their
posts
within
the
gate
round
about,
and
likewise
to
the
arches:
and
windows
were
round
about
inward:
and
upon
each
post
were
palm
trees.
040:017
Then
brought
he
me
into
the
outward
court,
and,
lo,
there
were
chambers,
and
a
pavement
made
for
the
court
round
about:
thirty
chambers
were
upon
the
pavement.
040:018
And
the
pavement
by
the
side
of
the
gates
over
against
the
length
of
the
gates
was
the
lower
pavement.
040:019
Then
he
measured
the
breadth
from
the
forefront
of
the
lower
gate
unto
the
forefront
of
the
inner
court
without,
an
hundred
cubits
eastward
and
northward.
040:020
And
the
gate
of
the
outward
court
that
looked
toward
the
north,
he
measured
the
length
thereof,
and
the
breadth
thereof.
040:021
And
the
little
chambers
thereof
were
three
on
this
side
and
three
on
that
side;
and
the
posts
thereof
and
the
arches
thereof
were
after
the
measure
of
the
first
gate:
the
length
thereof
was
fifty
cubits,
and
the
breadth
five
and
twenty
cubits.
040:022
And
their
windows,
and
their
arches,
and
their
palm
trees,
were
after
the
measure
of
the
gate
that
looketh
toward
the
east;
and
they
went
up
unto
it
by
seven
steps;
and
the
arches
thereof
were
before
them.
040:023
And
the
gate
of
the
inner
court
was
over
against
the
gate
toward
the
north,
and
toward
the
east;
and
he
measured
from
gate
to
gate
an
hundred
cubits.
040:024
After
that
he
brought
me
toward
the
south,
and
behold
a
gate
toward
the
south:
and
he
measured
the
posts
thereof
and
the
arches
thereof
according
to
these
measures.
040:025
And
there
were
windows
in
it
and
in
the
arches
thereof
round
about,
like
those
windows:
the
length
was
fifty
cubits,
and
the
breadth
five
and
twenty
cubits.
040:026
And
there
were
seven
steps
to
go
up
to
it,
and
the
arches
thereof
were
before
them:
and
it
had
palm
trees,
one
on
this
side,
and
another
on
that
side,
upon
the
posts
thereof.
040:027
And
there
was
a
gate
in
the
inner
court
toward
the
south:
and
he
measured
from
gate
to
gate
toward
the
south
an
hundred
cubits.
040:028
And
he
brought
me
to
the
inner
court
by
the
south
gate:
and
he
measured
the
south
gate
according
to
these
measures;
040:029
And
the
little
chambers
thereof,
and
the
posts
thereof,
and
the
arches
thereof,
according
to
these
measures:
and
there
were
windows
in
it
and
in
the
arches
thereof
round
about:
it
was
fifty
cubits
long,
and
five
and
twenty
cubits
broad.
040:030
And
the
arches
round
about
were
five
and
twenty
cubits
long,
and
five
cubits
broad.
040:031
And
the
arches
thereof
were
