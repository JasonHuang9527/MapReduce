toward
the
utter
court;
and
palm
trees
were
upon
the
posts
thereof:
and
the
going
up
to
it
had
eight
steps.
040:032
And
he
brought
me
into
the
inner
court
toward
the
east:
and
he
measured
the
gate
according
to
these
measures.
040:033
And
the
little
chambers
thereof,
and
the
posts
thereof,
and
the
arches
thereof,
were
according
to
these
measures:
and
there
were
windows
therein
and
in
the
arches
thereof
round
about:
it
was
fifty
cubits
long,
and
five
and
twenty
cubits
broad.
040:034
And
the
arches
thereof
were
toward
the
outward
court;
and
palm
trees
were
upon
the
posts
thereof,
on
this
side,
and
on
that
side:
and
the
going
up
to
it
had
eight
steps.
040:035
And
he
brought
me
to
the
north
gate,
and
measured
it
according
to
these
measures;
040:036
The
little
chambers
thereof,
the
posts
thereof,
and
the
arches
thereof,
and
the
windows
to
it
round
about:
the
length
was
fifty
cubits,
and
the
breadth
five
and
twenty
cubits.
040:037
And
the
posts
thereof
were
toward
the
utter
court;
and
palm
trees
were
upon
the
posts
thereof,
on
this
side,
and
on
that
side:
and
the
going
up
to
it
had
eight
steps.
040:038
And
the
chambers
and
the
entries
thereof
were
by
the
posts
of
the
gates,
where
they
washed
the
burnt
offering.
040:039
And
in
the
porch
of
the
gate
were
two
tables
on
this
side,
and
two
tables
on
that
side,
to
slay
thereon
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sin
offering
and
the
trespass
offering.
040:040
And
at
the
side
without,
as
one
goeth
up
to
the
entry
of
the
north
gate,
were
two
tables;
and
on
the
other
side,
which
was
at
the
porch
of
the
gate,
were
two
tables.
040:041
Four
tables
were
on
this
side,
and
four
tables
on
that
side,
by
the
side
of
the
gate;
eight
tables,
whereupon
they
slew
their
sacrifices.
040:042
And
the
four
tables
were
of
hewn
stone
for
the
burnt
offering,
of
a
cubit
and
an
half
long,
and
a
cubit
and
an
half
broad,
and
one
cubit
high:
whereupon
also
they
laid
the
instruments
wherewith
they
slew
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sacrifice.
040:043
And
within
were
hooks,
an
hand
broad,
fastened
round
about:
and
upon
the
tables
was
the
flesh
of
the
offering.
040:044
And
without
the
inner
gate
were
the
chambers
of
the
singers
in
the
inner
court,
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
north
gate;
and
their
prospect
was
toward
the
south:
one
at
the
side
of
the
east
gate
having
the
prospect
toward
the
north.
040:045
And
he
said
unto
me,
This
chamber,
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
south,
is
for
the
priests,
the
keepers
of
the
charge
of
the
house.
040:046
And
the
chamber
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
north
is
for
the
priests,
the
keepers
of
the
charge
of
the
altar:
these
are
the
sons
of
Zadok
among
the
sons
of
Levi,
which
come
near
to
the
LORD
to
minister
unto
him.
040:047
So
he
measured
the
court,
an
hundred
cubits
long,
and
an
hundred
cubits
broad,
foursquare;
and
the
altar
that
was
before
the
house.
040:048
And
he
brought
me
to
the
porch
of
the
house,
and
measured
each
post
of
the
porch,
five
cubits
on
this
side,
and
five
cubits
on
that
side:
and
the
breadth
of
the
gate
was
three
cubits
on
this
side,
and
three
cubits
on
that
side.
040:049
The
length
of
the
porch
was
twenty
cubits,
and
the
breadth
eleven
cubits,
and
he
brought
me
by
the
steps
whereby
they
went
up
to
it:
and
there
were
pillars
by
the
posts,
one
on
this
side,
and
another
on
that
side.
041:001
Afterward
he
brought
me
to
the
temple,
and
measured
the
posts,
six
cubits
broad
on
the
one
side,
and
six
cubits
broad
on
the
other
side,
which
was
the
breadth
of
the
tabernacle.
041:002
And
the
breadth
of
the
door
was
ten
cubits;
and
the
sides
of
the
door
were
five
cubits
on
the
one
side,
and
five
cubits
on
the
other
side:
and
he
measured
the
length
thereof,
forty
cubits:
and
the
breadth,
twenty
cubits.
041:003
Then
went
he
inward,
and
measured
the
post
of
the
door,
two
cubits;
and
the
door,
six
cubits;
and
the
breadth
of
the
door,
seven
cubits.
041:004
So
he
measured
the
length
thereof,
twenty
cubits;
and
the
breadth,
twenty
cubits,
before
the
temple:
and
he
said
unto
me,
This
is
the
most
holy
place.
041:005
After
he
measured
the
wall
of
the
house,
six
cubits;
and
the
breadth
of
every
side
chamber,
four
cubits,
round
about
the
house
on
every
side.
041:006
And
the
side
chambers
were
three,
one
over
another,
and
thirty
in
order;
and
they
entered
into
the
wall
which
was
of
the
house
for
the
side
chambers
round
about,
that
they
might
have
hold,
but
they
had
not
hold
in
the
wall
of
the
house.
041:007
And
there
was
an
enlarging,
and
a
winding
about
still
upward
to
the
side
chambers:
for
the
winding
about
of
the
house
went
still
upward
round
about
the
house:
therefore
the
breadth
of
the
house
was
still
upward,
and
so
increased
from
the
lowest
chamber
to
the
highest
by
the
midst.
041:008
I
saw
also
the
height
of
the
house
round
about:
the
foundations
of
the
side
chambers
were
a
full
reed
of
six
great
cubits.
041:009
The
thickness
of
the
wall,
which
was
for
the
side
chamber
without,
was
five
cubits:
and
that
which
was
left
was
the
place
of
the
side
chambers
that
were
within.
041:010
And
between
the
chambers
was
the
wideness
of
twenty
cubits
round
about
the
house
on
every
side.
041:011
And
the
doors
of
the
side
chambers
were
toward
the
place
that
was
left,
one
door
toward
the
north,
and
another
door
toward
the
south:
and
the
breadth
of
the
place
that
was
left
was
five
cubits
round
about.
041:012
Now
the
building
that
was
before
the
separate
place
at
the
end
toward
the
west
was
seventy
cubits
broad;
and
the
wall
of
the
building
was
five
cubits
thick
round
about,
and
the
length
thereof
ninety
cubits.
041:013
So
he
measured
the
house,
an
hundred
cubits
long;
and
the
separate
place,
and
the
building,
with
the
walls
thereof,
an
hundred
cubits
long;
041:014
Also
the
breadth
of
the
face
of
the
house,
and
of
the
separate
place
toward
the
east,
an
hundred
cubits.
041:015
And
he
measured
the
length
of
the
building
over
against
the
separate
place
which
was
behind
it,
and
the
galleries
thereof
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
side,
an
hundred
cubits,
with
the
inner
temple,
and
the
porches
of
the
court;
041:016
The
door
posts,
and
the
narrow
windows,
and
the
galleries
round
about
on
their
three
stories,
over
against
the
door,
cieled
with
wood
round
about,
and
from
the
ground
up
to
the
windows,
and
the
windows
were
covered;
041:017
To
that
above
the
door,
even
unto
the
inner
house,
and
without,
and
by
all
the
wall
round
about
within
and
without,
by
measure.
041:018
And
it
was
made
with
cherubims
and
palm
trees,
so
that
a
palm
tree
was
between
a
cherub
and
a
cherub;
and
every
cherub
had
two
faces;
041:019
So
that
the
face
of
a
man
was
toward
the
palm
tree
on
the
one
side,
and
the
face
of
a
young
lion
toward
the
palm
tree
on
the
other
side:
it
was
made
through
all
the
house
round
about.
041:020
From
the
ground
unto
above
the
door
were
cherubims
and
palm
trees
made,
and
on
the
wall
of
the
temple.
041:021
The
posts
of
the
temple
were
squared,
and
the
face
of
the
sanctuary;
the
appearance
of
the
one
as
the
appearance
of
the
other.
041:022
The
altar
of
wood
was
three
cubits
high,
and
the
length
thereof
two
cubits;
and
the
corners
thereof,
and
the
length
thereof,
and
the
walls
thereof,
were
of
wood:
and
he
said
unto
me,
This
is
the
table
that
is
before
the
LORD.
041:023
And
the
temple
and
the
sanctuary
had
two
doors.
041:024
And
the
doors
had
two
leaves
apiece,
two
turning
leaves;
two
leaves
for
the
one
door,
and
two
leaves
for
the
other
door.
041:025
And
there
were
made
on
them,
on
the
doors
of
the
temple,
cherubims
and
palm
trees,
like
as
were
made
upon
the
walls;
and
there
were
thick
planks
upon
the
face
of
the
porch
without.
041:026
And
there
were
narrow
windows
and
palm
trees
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
side,
on
the
sides
of
the
porch,
and
upon
the
side
chambers
of
the
house,
and
thick
planks.
042:001
Then
he
brought
me
forth
into
the
utter
court,
the
way
toward
the
north:
and
he
brought
me
into
the
chamber
that
was
over
against
the
separate
place,
and
which
was
before
the
building
toward
the
north.
042:002
Before
the
length
of
an
hundred
cubits
was
the
north
door,
and
the
breadth
was
fifty
cubits.
042:003
Over
against
the
twenty
cubits
which
were
for
the
inner
court,
and
over
against
the
pavement
which
was
for
the
utter
court,
was
gallery
against
gallery
in
three
stories.
042:004
And
before
the
chambers
was
a
walk
to
ten
cubits
breadth
inward,
a
way
of
one
cubit;
and
their
doors
toward
the
north.
042:005
Now
the
upper
chambers
were
shorter:
for
the
galleries
were
higher
than
these,
than
the
lower,
and
than
the
middlemost
of
the
building.
042:006
For
they
were
in
three
stories,
but
had
not
pillars
as
the
pillars
of
the
courts:
therefore
the
building
was
straitened
more
than
the
lowest
and
the
middlemost
from
the
ground.
042:007
And
the
wall
that
was
without
over
against
the
chambers,
toward
the
utter
court
on
the
forepart
of
the
chambers,
the
length
thereof
was
fifty
cubits.
042:008
For
the
length
of
the
chambers
that
were
in
the
utter
court
was
fifty
cubits:
and,
lo,
before
the
temple
were
an
hundred
cubits.
042:009
And
from
under
these
chambers
was
the
entry
on
the
east
side,
as
one
goeth
into
them
from
the
utter
court.
042:010
The
chambers
were
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
of
the
court
toward
the
east,
over
against
the
separate
place,
and
over
against
the
building.
042:011
And
the
way
before
them
was
like
the
appearance
of
the
chambers
which
were
toward
the
north,
as
long
as
they,
and
as
broad
as
they:
and
all
their
goings
out
were
both
according
to
their
fashions,
and
according
to
their
doors.
042:012
And
according
to
the
doors
of
the
chambers
that
were
toward
the
south
was
a
door
in
the
head
of
the
way,
even
the
way
directly
before
the
wall
toward
the
east,
as
one
entereth
into
them.
042:013
Then
said
he
unto
me,
The
north
chambers
and
the
south
chambers,
which
are
before
the
separate
place,
they
be
holy
chambers,
where
the
priests
that
approach
unto
the
LORD
shall
eat
the
most
holy
things:
there
shall
they
lay
the
most
holy
things,
and
the
meat
offering,
and
the
sin
offering,
and
the
trespass
offering;
for
the
place
is
holy.
042:014
When
the
priests
enter
therein,
then
shall
they
not
go
out
of
the
holy
place
into
the
utter
court,
but
there
they
shall
lay
their
garments
wherein
they
minister;
for
they
are
holy;
and
shall
put
on
other
garments,
and
shall
approach
to
those
things
which
are
for
the
people.
042:015
Now
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
measuring
the
inner
house,
he
brought
me
forth
toward
the
gate
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
east,
and
measured
it
round
about.
042:016
He
measured
the
east
side
with
the
measuring
reed,
five
hundred
reeds,
with
the
measuring
reed
round
about.
042:017
He
measured
the
north
side,
five
hundred
reeds,
with
the
measuring
reed
round
about.
042:018
He
measured
the
south
side,
five
hundred
reeds,
with
the
measuring
reed.
042:019
He
turned
about
to
the
west
side,
and
measured
five
hundred
reeds
with
the
measuring
reed.
042:020
He
measured
it
by
the
four
sides:
it
had
a
wall
round
about,
five
hundred
reeds
long,
and
five
hundred
broad,
to
make
a
separation
between
the
sanctuary
and
the
profane
place.
043:001
Afterward
he
brought
me
to
the
gate,
even
the
gate
that
looketh
toward
the
east:
043:002
And,
behold,
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
came
from
the
way
of
the
east:
and
his
voice
was
like
a
noise
of
many
waters:
and
the
earth
shined
with
his
glory.
043:003
And
it
was
according
to
the
appearance
of
the
vision
which
I
saw,
even
according
to
the
vision
that
I
saw
when
I
came
to
destroy
the
city:
and
the
visions
were
like
the
vision
that
I
saw
by
the
river
Chebar;
and
I
fell
upon
my
face.
043:004
And
the
glory
of
the
LORD
came
into
the
house
by
the
way
of
the
gate
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
east.
043:005
So
the
spirit
took
me
up,
and
brought
me
into
the
inner
court;
and,
behold,
the
glory
of
the
LORD
filled
the
house.
043:006
And
I
heard
him
speaking
unto
me
out
of
the
house;
and
the
man
stood
by
me.
043:007
And
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
the
place
of
my
throne,
and
the
place
of
the
soles
of
my
feet,
where
I
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
Israel
for
ever,
and
my
holy
name,
shall
the
house
of
Israel
no
more
defile,
neither
they,
nor
their
kings,
by
their
whoredom,
nor
by
the
carcases
of
their
kings
in
their
high
places.
043:008
In
their
setting
of
their
threshold
by
my
thresholds,
and
their
post
by
my
posts,
and
the
wall
between
me
and
them,
they
have
even
defiled
my
holy
name
by
their
abominations
that
they
have
committed:
wherefore
I
have
consumed
them
in
mine
anger.
043:009
Now
let
them
put
away
their
whoredom,
and
the
carcases
of
their
kings,
far
from
me,
and
I
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
them
for
ever.
043:010
Thou
son
of
man,
shew
the
house
to
the
house
of
Israel,
that
they
may
be
ashamed
of
their
iniquities:
and
let
them
measure
the
pattern.
043:011
And
if
they
be
ashamed
of
all
that
they
have
done,
shew
them
the
form
of
the
house,
and
the
fashion
thereof,
and
the
goings
out
thereof,
and
the
comings
in
thereof,
and
all
the
forms
thereof,
and
all
the
ordinances
thereof,
and
all
the
forms
thereof,
and
all
the
laws
thereof:
and
write
it
in
their
sight,
that
they
may
keep
the
whole
form
thereof,
and
all
the
ordinances
thereof,
and
do
them.
043:012
This
is
the
law
of
the
house;
Upon
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
whole
limit
thereof
round
about
shall
be
most
holy.
Behold,
this
is
the
law
of
the
house.
043:013
And
these
are
the
measures
of
the
altar
after
the
cubits:
The
cubit
is
a
cubit
and
an
hand
breadth;
even
the
bottom
shall
be
a
cubit,
and
the
breadth
a
cubit,
and
the
border
thereof
by
the
edge
thereof
round
about
shall
be
a
span:
and
this
shall
be
the
higher
place
of
the
altar.
043:014
And
from
the
bottom
upon
the
ground
even
to
the
lower
settle
shall
be
two
cubits,
and
the
breadth
one
cubit;
and
from
the
lesser
settle
even
to
the
greater
settle
shall
be
four
cubits,
and
the
breadth
one
cubit.
043:015
So
the
altar
shall
be
four
cubits;
and
from
the
altar
and
upward
shall
be
four
horns.
043:016
And
the
altar
shall
be
twelve
cubits
long,
twelve
broad,
square
in
the
four
squares
thereof.
043:017
And
the
settle
shall
be
fourteen
cubits
long
and
fourteen
broad
in
the
four
squares
thereof;
and
the
border
about
it
shall
be
half
a
cubit;
and
the
bottom
thereof
shall
be
a
cubit
about;
and
his
stairs
shall
look
toward
the
east.
043:018
And
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
These
are
the
ordinances
of
the
altar
in
the
day
when
they
shall
make
it,
to
offer
burnt
offerings
thereon,
and
to
sprinkle
blood
thereon.
043:019
And
thou
shalt
give
to
the
priests
the
Levites
that
be
of
the
seed
of
Zadok,
which
approach
unto
me,
to
minister
unto
me,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
a
young
bullock
for
a
sin
offering.
043:020
And
thou
shalt
take
of
the
blood
thereof,
and
put
it
on
the
four
horns
of
it,
and
on
the
four
corners
of
the
settle,
and
upon
the
border
round
about:
thus
shalt
thou
cleanse
and
purge
it.
043:021
Thou
shalt
take
the
bullock
also
of
the
sin
offering,
and
he
shall
burn
it
in
the
appointed
place
of
the
house,
without
the
sanctuary.
043:022
And
on
the
second
day
thou
shalt
offer
a
kid
of
the
goats
without
blemish
for
a
sin
offering;
and
they
shall
cleanse
the
altar,
as
they
did
cleanse
it
with
the
bullock.
043:023
When
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
cleansing
it,
thou
shalt
offer
a
young
bullock
without
blemish,
and
a
ram
out
of
the
flock
without
blemish.
043:024
And
thou
shalt
offer
them
before
the
LORD,
and
the
priests
shall
cast
salt
upon
them,
and
they
shall
offer
them
up
for
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
LORD.
043:025
Seven
days
shalt
thou
prepare
every
day
a
goat
for
a
sin
offering:
they
shall
also
prepare
a
young
bullock,
and
a
ram
out
of
the
flock,
without
blemish.
043:026
Seven
days
shall
they
purge
the
altar
and
purify
it;
and
they
shall
consecrate
themselves.
043:027
And
when
these
days
are
expired,
it
shall
be,
that
upon
the
eighth
day,
and
so
forward,
the
priests
shall
make
your
burnt
offerings
upon
the
altar,
and
your
peace
offerings;
and
I
will
accept
you,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
044:001
Then
he
brought
me
back
the
way
of
the
gate
of
the
outward
sanctuary
which
looketh
toward
the
east;
and
it
was
shut.
044:002
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
me;
This
gate
shall
be
shut,
it
shall
not
be
opened,
and
no
man
shall
enter
in
by
it;
because
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel,
hath
entered
in
by
it,
therefore
it
shall
be
shut.
044:003
It
is
for
the
prince;
the
prince,
he
shall
sit
in
it
to
eat
bread
before
the
LORD;
he
shall
enter
by
the
way
of
the
porch
of
that
gate,
and
shall
go
out
by
the
way
of
the
same.
044:004
Then
brought
he
me
the
way
of
the
north
gate
before
the
house:
and
I
looked,
and,
behold,
the
glory
of
the
LORD
filled
the
house
of
the
LORD:
and
I
fell
upon
my
face.
044:005
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
mark
well,
and
behold
with
thine
eyes,
and
hear
with
thine
ears
all
that
I
say
unto
thee
concerning
all
the
ordinances
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
all
the
laws
thereof;
and
mark
well
the
entering
in
of
the
house,
with
every
going
forth
of
the
sanctuary.
044:006
And
thou
shalt
say
to
the
rebellious,
even
to
the
house
of
Israel,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
O
ye
house
of
Israel,
let
it
suffice
you
of
all
your
abominations,
044:007
In
that
ye
have
brought
into
my
sanctuary
strangers,
uncircumcised
in
heart,
and
uncircumcised
in
flesh,
to
be
in
my
sanctuary,
to
pollute
it,
even
my
house,
when
ye
offer
my
bread,
the
fat
and
the
blood,
and
they
have
broken
my
covenant
because
of
all
your
abominations.
044:008
And
ye
have
not
kept
the
charge
of
mine
holy
things:
but
ye
have
set
keepers
of
my
charge
in
my
sanctuary
for
yourselves.
044:009
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
No
stranger,
uncircumcised
in
heart,
nor
uncircumcised
in
flesh,
shall
enter
into
my
sanctuary,
of
any
stranger
that
is
among
the
children
of
Israel.
044:010
And
the
Levites
that
are
gone
away
far
from
me,
when
Israel
went
astray,
which
went
astray
away
from
me
after
their
idols;
they
shall
even
bear
their
iniquity.
044:011
Yet
they
shall
be
ministers
in
my
sanctuary,
having
charge
at
the
gates
of
the
house,
and
ministering
to
the
house:
they
shall
slay
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sacrifice
for
the
people,
and
they
shall
stand
before
them
to
minister
unto
them.
044:012
Because
they
ministered
unto
them
before
their
idols,
and
caused
the
house
of
Israel
to
fall
into
iniquity;
therefore
have
I
lifted
up
mine
hand
against
them,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
and
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity.
044:013
And
they
shall
not
come
near
unto
me,
to
do
the
office
of
a
priest
unto
me,
nor
to
come
near
to
any
of
my
holy
things,
in
the
most
holy
place:
but
they
shall
bear
their
shame,
and
their
abominations
which
they
have
committed.
044:014
But
I
will
make
them
keepers
of
the
charge
of
the
house,
for
all
the
service
thereof,
and
for
all
that
shall
be
done
therein.
044:015
But
the
priests
the
Levites,
the
sons
of
Zadok,
that
kept
the
charge
of
my
sanctuary
when
the
children
of
Israel
went
astray
from
me,
they
shall
come
near
to
me
to
minister
unto
me,
and
they
shall
stand
before
me
to
offer
unto
me
the
fat
and
the
blood,
saith
the
Lord
GOD:
044:016
They
shall
enter
into
my
sanctuary,
and
they
shall
come
near
to
my
table,
to
minister
unto
me,
and
they
shall
keep
my
charge.
044:017
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
when
they
enter
in
at
the
gates
of
the
inner
court,
they
shall
be
clothed
with
linen
garments;
and
no
wool
shall
come
upon
them,
whiles
they
minister
in
the
gates
of
the
inner
court,
and
within.
044:018
They
shall
have
linen
bonnets
upon
their
heads,
and
shall
have
linen
breeches
upon
their
loins;
they
shall
not
gird
themselves
with
any
thing
that
causeth
sweat.
044:019
And
when
they
go
forth
into
the
utter
court,
even
into
the
utter
court
to
the
people,
they
shall
put
off
their
garments
wherein
they
ministered,
and
lay
them
in
the
holy
chambers,
and
they
shall
put
on
other
garments;
and
they
shall
not
sanctify
the
people
with
their
garments.
044:020
Neither
shall
they
shave
their
heads,
nor
suffer
their
locks
to
grow
long;
they
shall
only
poll
their
heads.
044:021
Neither
shall
any
priest
drink
wine,
when
they
enter
into
the
inner
court.
044:022
Neither
shall
they
take
for
their
wives
a
widow,
nor
her
that
is
put
away:
but
they
shall
take
maidens
of
the
seed
of
the
house
of
Israel,
or
a
widow
that
had
a
priest
before.
044:023
And
they
shall
teach
my
people
the
difference
between
the
holy
and
profane,
and
cause
them
to
discern
between
the
unclean
and
the
clean.
044:024
And
in
controversy
they
shall
stand
in
judgment;
and
they
shall
judge
it
according
to
my
judgments:
and
they
shall
keep
my
laws
and
my
statutes
in
all
mine
assemblies;
and
they
shall
hallow
my
sabbaths.
044:025
And
they
shall
come
at
no
dead
person
to
defile
themselves:
but
for
father,
or
for
mother,
or
for
son,
or
for
daughter,
for
brother,
or
for
sister
that
hath
had
no
husband,
they
may
defile
themselves.
044:026
And
after
he
is
cleansed,
they
shall
reckon
unto
him
seven
days.
044:027
And
in
the
day
that
he
goeth
into
the
sanctuary,
unto
the
inner
court,
to
minister
in
the
sanctuary,
he
shall
offer
his
sin
offering,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
044:028
And
it
shall
be
unto
them
for
an
inheritance:
I
am
their
inheritance:
and
ye
shall
give
them
no
possession
in
Israel:
I
am
their
possession.
044:029
They
shall
eat
the
meat
offering,
and
the
sin
offering,
and
the
trespass
offering:
and
every
dedicated
thing
in
Israel
shall
be
theirs.
044:030
And
the
first
of
all
the
firstfruits
of
all
things,
and
every
oblation
of
all,
of
every
sort
of
your
oblations,
shall
be
the
priest's:
ye
shall
also
give
unto
the
priest
the
first
of
your
dough,
that
he
may
cause
the
blessing
to
rest
in
thine
house.
044:031
The
priests
shall
not
eat
of
any
thing
that
is
dead
of
itself,
or
torn,
whether
it
be
fowl
or
beast.
045:001
Moreover,
when
ye
shall
divide
by
lot
the
land
for
inheritance,
ye
shall
offer
an
oblation
unto
the
LORD,
an
holy
portion
of
the
land:
the
length
shall
be
the
length
of
five
and
twenty
thousand
reeds,
and
the
breadth
shall
be
ten
thousand.
This
shall
be
holy
in
all
the
borders
thereof
round
about.
045:002
Of
this
there
shall
be
for
the
sanctuary
five
hundred
in
length,
with
five
hundred
