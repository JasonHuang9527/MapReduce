in
breadth,
square
round
about;
and
fifty
cubits
round
about
for
the
suburbs
thereof.
045:003
And
of
this
measure
shalt
thou
measure
the
length
of
five
and
twenty
thousand,
and
the
breadth
of
ten
thousand:
and
in
it
shall
be
the
sanctuary
and
the
most
holy
place.
045:004
The
holy
portion
of
the
land
shall
be
for
the
priests
the
ministers
of
the
sanctuary,
which
shall
come
near
to
minister
unto
the
LORD:
and
it
shall
be
a
place
for
their
houses,
and
an
holy
place
for
the
sanctuary.
045:005
And
the
five
and
twenty
thousand
of
length,
and
the
ten
thousand
of
breadth
shall
also
the
Levites,
the
ministers
of
the
house,
have
for
themselves,
for
a
possession
for
twenty
chambers.
045:006
And
ye
shall
appoint
the
possession
of
the
city
five
thousand
broad,
and
five
and
twenty
thousand
long,
over
against
the
oblation
of
the
holy
portion:
it
shall
be
for
the
whole
house
of
Israel.
045:007
And
a
portion
shall
be
for
the
prince
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
oblation
of
the
holy
portion,
and
of
the
possession
of
the
city,
before
the
oblation
of
the
holy
portion,
and
before
the
possession
of
the
city,
from
the
west
side
westward,
and
from
the
east
side
eastward:
and
the
length
shall
be
over
against
one
of
the
portions,
from
the
west
border
unto
the
east
border.
045:008
In
the
land
shall
be
his
possession
in
Israel:
and
my
princes
shall
no
more
oppress
my
people;
and
the
rest
of
the
land
shall
they
give
to
the
house
of
Israel
according
to
their
tribes.
045:009
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
Let
it
suffice
you,
O
princes
of
Israel:
remove
violence
and
spoil,
and
execute
judgment
and
justice,
take
away
your
exactions
from
my
people,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
045:010
Ye
shall
have
just
balances,
and
a
just
ephah,
and
a
just
bath.
045:011
The
ephah
and
the
bath
shall
be
of
one
measure,
that
the
bath
may
contain
the
tenth
part
of
an
homer,
and
the
ephah
the
tenth
part
of
an
homer:
the
measure
thereof
shall
be
after
the
homer.
045:012
And
the
shekel
shall
be
twenty
gerahs:
twenty
shekels,
five
and
twenty
shekels,
fifteen
shekels,
shall
be
your
maneh.
045:013
This
is
the
oblation
that
ye
shall
offer;
the
sixth
part
of
an
ephah
of
an
homer
of
wheat,
and
ye
shall
give
the
sixth
part
of
an
ephah
of
an
homer
of
barley:
045:014
Concerning
the
ordinance
of
oil,
the
bath
of
oil,
ye
shall
offer
the
tenth
part
of
a
bath
out
of
the
cor,
which
is
an
homer
of
ten
baths;
for
ten
baths
are
an
homer:
045:015
And
one
lamb
out
of
the
flock,
out
of
two
hundred,
out
of
the
fat
pastures
of
Israel;
for
a
meat
offering,
and
for
a
burnt
offering,
and
for
peace
offerings,
to
make
reconciliation
for
them,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
045:016
All
the
people
of
the
land
shall
give
this
oblation
for
the
prince
in
Israel.
045:017
And
it
shall
be
the
prince's
part
to
give
burnt
offerings,
and
meat
offerings,
and
drink
offerings,
in
the
feasts,
and
in
the
new
moons,
and
in
the
sabbaths,
in
all
solemnities
of
the
house
of
Israel:
he
shall
prepare
the
sin
offering,
and
the
meat
offering,
and
the
burnt
offering,
and
the
peace
offerings,
to
make
reconciliation
for
the
house
of
Israel.
045:018
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
In
the
first
month,
in
the
first
day
of
the
month,
thou
shalt
take
a
young
bullock
without
blemish,
and
cleanse
the
sanctuary:
045:019
And
the
priest
shall
take
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering,
and
put
it
upon
the
posts
of
the
house,
and
upon
the
four
corners
of
the
settle
of
the
altar,
and
upon
the
posts
of
the
gate
of
the
inner
court.
045:020
And
so
thou
shalt
do
the
seventh
day
of
the
month
for
every
one
that
erreth,
and
for
him
that
is
simple:
so
shall
ye
reconcile
the
house.
045:021
In
the
first
month,
in
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month,
ye
shall
have
the
passover,
a
feast
of
seven
days;
unleavened
bread
shall
be
eaten.
045:022
And
upon
that
day
shall
the
prince
prepare
for
himself
and
for
all
the
people
of
the
land
a
bullock
for
a
sin
offering.
045:023
And
seven
days
of
the
feast
he
shall
prepare
a
burnt
offering
to
the
LORD,
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
without
blemish
daily
the
seven
days;
and
a
kid
of
the
goats
daily
for
a
sin
offering.
045:024
And
he
shall
prepare
a
meat
offering
of
an
ephah
for
a
bullock,
and
an
ephah
for
a
ram,
and
an
hin
of
oil
for
an
ephah.
045:025
In
the
seventh
month,
in
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month,
shall
he
do
the
like
in
the
feast
of
the
seven
days,
according
to
the
sin
offering,
according
to
the
burnt
offering,
and
according
to
the
meat
offering,
and
according
to
the
oil.
046:001
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
The
gate
of
the
inner
court
that
looketh
toward
the
east
shall
be
shut
the
six
working
days;
but
on
the
sabbath
it
shall
be
opened,
and
in
the
day
of
the
new
moon
it
shall
be
opened.
046:002
And
the
prince
shall
enter
by
the
way
of
the
porch
of
that
gate
without,
and
shall
stand
by
the
post
of
the
gate,
and
the
priests
shall
prepare
his
burnt
offering
and
his
peace
offerings,
and
he
shall
worship
at
the
threshold
of
the
gate:
then
he
shall
go
forth;
but
the
gate
shall
not
be
shut
until
the
evening.
046:003
Likewise
the
people
of
the
land
shall
worship
at
the
door
of
this
gate
before
the
LORD
in
the
sabbaths
and
in
the
new
moons.
046:004
And
the
burnt
offering
that
the
prince
shall
offer
unto
the
LORD
in
the
sabbath
day
shall
be
six
lambs
without
blemish,
and
a
ram
without
blemish.
046:005
And
the
meat
offering
shall
be
an
ephah
for
a
ram,
and
the
meat
offering
for
the
lambs
as
he
shall
be
able
to
give,
and
an
hin
of
oil
to
an
ephah.
046:006
And
in
the
day
of
the
new
moon
it
shall
be
a
young
bullock
without
blemish,
and
six
lambs,
and
a
ram:
they
shall
be
without
blemish.
046:007
And
he
shall
prepare
a
meat
offering,
an
ephah
for
a
bullock,
and
an
ephah
for
a
ram,
and
for
the
lambs
according
as
his
hand
shall
attain
unto,
and
an
hin
of
oil
to
an
ephah.
046:008
And
when
the
prince
shall
enter,
he
shall
go
in
by
the
way
of
the
porch
of
that
gate,
and
he
shall
go
forth
by
the
way
thereof.
046:009
But
when
the
people
of
the
land
shall
come
before
the
LORD
in
the
solemn
feasts,
he
that
entereth
in
by
the
way
of
the
north
gate
to
worship
shall
go
out
by
the
way
of
the
south
gate;
and
he
that
entereth
by
the
way
of
the
south
gate
shall
go
forth
by
the
way
of
the
north
gate:
he
shall
not
return
by
the
way
of
the
gate
whereby
he
came
in,
but
shall
go
forth
over
against
it.
046:010
And
the
prince
in
the
midst
of
them,
when
they
go
in,
shall
go
in;
and
when
they
go
forth,
shall
go
forth.
046:011
And
in
the
feasts
and
in
the
solemnities
the
meat
offering
shall
be
an
ephah
to
a
bullock,
and
an
ephah
to
a
ram,
and
to
the
lambs
as
he
is
able
to
give,
and
an
hin
of
oil
to
an
ephah.
046:012
Now
when
the
prince
shall
prepare
a
voluntary
burnt
offering
or
peace
offerings
voluntarily
unto
the
LORD,
one
shall
then
open
him
the
gate
that
looketh
toward
the
east,
and
he
shall
prepare
his
burnt
offering
and
his
peace
offerings,
as
he
did
on
the
sabbath
day:
then
he
shall
go
forth;
and
after
his
going
forth
one
shall
shut
the
gate.
046:013
Thou
shalt
daily
prepare
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
LORD
of
a
lamb
of
the
first
year
without
blemish:
thou
shalt
prepare
it
every
morning.
046:014
And
thou
shalt
prepare
a
meat
offering
for
it
every
morning,
the
sixth
part
of
an
ephah,
and
the
third
part
of
an
hin
of
oil,
to
temper
with
the
fine
flour;
a
meat
offering
continually
by
a
perpetual
ordinance
unto
the
LORD.
046:015
Thus
shall
they
prepare
the
lamb,
and
the
meat
offering,
and
the
oil,
every
morning
for
a
continual
burnt
offering.
046:016
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
If
the
prince
give
a
gift
unto
any
of
his
sons,
the
inheritance
thereof
shall
be
his
sons';
it
shall
be
their
possession
by
inheritance.
046:017
But
if
he
give
a
gift
of
his
inheritance
to
one
of
his
servants,
then
it
shall
be
his
to
the
year
of
liberty;
after
it
shall
return
to
the
prince:
but
his
inheritance
shall
be
his
sons'
for
them.
046:018
Moreover
the
prince
shall
not
take
of
the
people's
inheritance
by
oppression,
to
thrust
them
out
of
their
possession;
but
he
shall
give
his
sons
inheritance
out
of
his
own
possession:
that
my
people
be
not
scattered
every
man
from
his
possession.
046:019
After
he
brought
me
through
the
entry,
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
gate,
into
the
holy
chambers
of
the
priests,
which
looked
toward
the
north:
and,
behold,
there
was
a
place
on
the
two
sides
westward.
046:020
Then
said
he
unto
me,
This
is
the
place
where
the
priests
shall
boil
the
trespass
offering
and
the
sin
offering,
where
they
shall
bake
the
meat
offering;
that
they
bear
them
not
out
into
the
utter
court,
to
sanctify
the
people.
046:021
Then
he
brought
me
forth
into
the
utter
court,
and
caused
me
to
pass
by
the
four
corners
of
the
court;
and,
behold,
in
every
corner
of
the
court
there
was
a
court.
046:022
In
the
four
corners
of
the
court
there
were
courts
joined
of
forty
cubits
long
and
thirty
broad:
these
four
corners
were
of
one
measure.
046:023
And
there
was
a
row
of
building
round
about
in
them,
round
about
them
four,
and
it
was
made
with
boiling
places
under
the
rows
round
about.
046:024
Then
said
he
unto
me,
These
are
the
places
of
them
that
boil,
where
the
ministers
of
the
house
shall
boil
the
sacrifice
of
the
people.
047:001
Afterward
he
brought
me
again
unto
the
door
of
the
house;
and,
behold,
waters
issued
out
from
under
the
threshold
of
the
house
eastward:
for
the
forefront
of
the
house
stood
toward
the
east,
and
the
waters
came
down
from
under
from
the
right
side
of
the
house,
at
the
south
side
of
the
altar.
047:002
Then
brought
he
me
out
of
the
way
of
the
gate
northward,
and
led
me
about
the
way
without
unto
the
utter
gate
by
the
way
that
looketh
eastward;
and,
behold,
there
ran
out
waters
on
the
right
side.
047:003
And
when
the
man
that
had
the
line
in
his
hand
went
forth
eastward,
he
measured
a
thousand
cubits,
and
he
brought
me
through
the
waters;
the
waters
were
to
the
ankles.
047:004
Again
he
measured
a
thousand,
and
brought
me
through
the
waters;
the
waters
were
to
the
knees.
Again
he
measured
a
thousand,
and
brought
me
through;
the
waters
were
to
the
loins.
047:005
Afterward
he
measured
a
thousand;
and
it
was
a
river
that
I
could
not
pass
over:
for
the
waters
were
risen,
waters
to
swim
in,
a
river
that
could
not
be
passed
over.
047:006
And
he
said
unto
me,
Son
of
man,
hast
thou
seen
this?
Then
he
brought
me,
and
caused
me
to
return
to
the
brink
of
the
river.
047:007
Now
when
I
had
returned,
behold,
at
the
bank
of
the
river
were
very
many
trees
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other.
047:008
Then
said
he
unto
me,
These
waters
issue
out
toward
the
east
country,
and
go
down
into
the
desert,
and
go
into
the
sea:
which
being
brought
forth
into
the
sea,
the
waters
shall
be
healed.
047:009
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
every
thing
that
liveth,
which
moveth,
whithersoever
the
rivers
shall
come,
shall
live:
and
there
shall
be
a
very
great
multitude
of
fish,
because
these
waters
shall
come
thither:
for
they
shall
be
healed;
and
every
thing
shall
live
whither
the
river
cometh.
047:010
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
the
fishers
shall
stand
upon
it
from
Engedi
even
unto
Eneglaim;
they
shall
be
a
place
to
spread
forth
nets;
their
fish
shall
be
according
to
their
kinds,
as
the
fish
of
the
great
sea,
exceeding
many.
047:011
But
the
miry
places
thereof
and
the
marishes
thereof
shall
not
be
healed;
they
shall
be
given
to
salt.
047:012
And
by
the
river
upon
the
bank
thereof,
on
this
side
and
on
that
side,
shall
grow
all
trees
for
meat,
whose
leaf
shall
not
fade,
neither
shall
the
fruit
thereof
be
consumed:
it
shall
bring
forth
new
fruit
according
to
his
months,
because
their
waters
they
issued
out
of
the
sanctuary:
and
the
fruit
thereof
shall
be
for
meat,
and
the
leaf
thereof
for
medicine.
047:013
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
This
shall
be
the
border,
whereby
ye
shall
inherit
the
land
according
to
the
twelve
tribes
of
Israel:
Joseph
shall
have
two
portions.
047:014
And
ye
shall
inherit
it,
one
as
well
as
another:
concerning
the
which
I
lifted
up
mine
hand
to
give
it
unto
your
fathers:
and
this
land
shall
fall
unto
you
for
inheritance.
047:015
And
this
shall
be
the
border
of
the
land
toward
the
north
side,
from
the
great
sea,
the
way
of
Hethlon,
as
men
go
to
Zedad;
047:016
Hamath,
Berothah,
Sibraim,
which
is
between
the
border
of
Damascus
and
the
border
of
Hamath;
Hazarhatticon,
which
is
by
the
coast
of
Hauran.
047:017
And
the
border
from
the
sea
shall
be
Hazarenan,
the
border
of
Damascus,
and
the
north
northward,
and
the
border
of
Hamath.
And
this
is
the
north
side.
047:018
And
the
east
side
ye
shall
measure
from
Hauran,
and
from
Damascus,
and
from
Gilead,
and
from
the
land
of
Israel
by
Jordan,
from
the
border
unto
the
east
sea.
And
this
is
the
east
side.
047:019
And
the
south
side
southward,
from
Tamar
even
to
the
waters
of
strife
in
Kadesh,
the
river
to
the
great
sea.
And
this
is
the
south
side
southward.
047:020
The
west
side
also
shall
be
the
great
sea
from
the
border,
till
a
man
come
over
against
Hamath.
This
is
the
west
side.
047:021
So
shall
ye
divide
this
land
unto
you
according
to
the
tribes
of
Israel.
047:022
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
ye
shall
divide
it
by
lot
for
an
inheritance
unto
you,
and
to
the
strangers
that
sojourn
among
you,
which
shall
beget
children
among
you:
and
they
shall
be
unto
you
as
born
in
the
country
among
the
children
of
Israel;
they
shall
have
inheritance
with
you
among
the
tribes
of
Israel.
047:023
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
in
what
tribe
the
stranger
sojourneth,
there
shall
ye
give
him
his
inheritance,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
048:001
Now
these
are
the
names
of
the
tribes.
From
the
north
end
to
the
coast
of
the
way
of
Hethlon,
as
one
goeth
to
Hamath,
Hazarenan,
the
border
of
Damascus
northward,
to
the
coast
of
Hamath;
for
these
are
his
sides
east
and
west;
a
portion
for
Dan.
048:002
And
by
the
border
of
Dan,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
a
portion
for
Asher.
048:003
And
by
the
border
of
Asher,
from
the
east
side
even
unto
the
west
side,
a
portion
for
Naphtali.
048:004
And
by
the
border
of
Naphtali,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
a
portion
for
Manasseh.
048:005
And
by
the
border
of
Manasseh,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
a
portion
for
Ephraim.
048:006
And
by
the
border
of
Ephraim,
from
the
east
side
even
unto
the
west
side,
a
portion
for
Reuben.
048:007
And
by
the
border
of
Reuben,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
a
portion
for
Judah.
048:008
And
by
the
border
of
Judah,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
shall
be
the
offering
which
ye
shall
offer
of
five
and
twenty
thousand
reeds
in
breadth,
and
in
length
as
one
of
the
other
parts,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side:
and
the
sanctuary
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
it.
048:009
The
oblation
that
ye
shall
offer
unto
the
LORD
shall
be
of
five
and
twenty
thousand
in
length,
and
of
ten
thousand
in
breadth.
048:010
And
for
them,
even
for
the
priests,
shall
be
this
holy
oblation;
toward
the
north
five
and
twenty
thousand
in
length,
and
toward
the
west
ten
thousand
in
breadth,
and
toward
the
east
ten
thousand
in
breadth,
and
toward
the
south
five
and
twenty
thousand
in
length:
and
the
sanctuary
of
the
LORD
shall
be
in
the
midst
thereof.
048:011
It
shall
be
for
the
priests
that
are
sanctified
of
the
sons
of
Zadok;
which
have
kept
my
charge,
which
went
not
astray
when
the
children
of
Israel
went
astray,
as
the
Levites
went
astray.
048:012
And
this
oblation
of
the
land
that
is
offered
shall
be
unto
them
a
thing
most
holy
by
the
border
of
the
Levites.
048:013
And
over
against
the
border
of
the
priests
the
Levites
shall
have
five
and
twenty
thousand
in
length,
and
ten
thousand
in
breadth:
all
the
length
shall
be
five
and
twenty
thousand,
and
the
breadth
ten
thousand.
048:014
And
they
shall
not
sell
of
it,
neither
exchange,
nor
alienate
the
firstfruits
of
the
land:
for
it
is
holy
unto
the
LORD.
048:015
And
the
five
thousand,
that
are
left
in
the
breadth
over
against
the
five
and
twenty
thousand,
shall
be
a
profane
place
for
the
city,
for
dwelling,
and
for
suburbs:
and
the
city
shall
be
in
the
midst
thereof.
048:016
And
these
shall
be
the
measures
thereof;
the
north
side
four
thousand
and
five
hundred,
and
the
south
side
four
thousand
and
five
hundred,
and
on
the
east
side
four
thousand
and
five
hundred,
and
the
west
side
four
thousand
and
five
hundred.
048:017
And
the
suburbs
of
the
city
shall
be
toward
the
north
two
hundred
and
fifty,
and
toward
the
south
two
hundred
and
fifty,
and
toward
the
east
two
hundred
and
fifty,
and
toward
the
west
two
hundred
and
fifty.
048:018
And
the
residue
in
length
over
against
the
oblation
of
the
holy
portion
shall
be
ten
thousand
eastward,
and
ten
thousand
westward:
and
it
shall
be
over
against
the
oblation
of
the
holy
portion;
and
the
increase
thereof
shall
be
for
food
unto
them
that
serve
the
city.
048:019
And
they
that
serve
the
city
shall
serve
it
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel.
048:020
All
the
oblation
shall
be
five
and
twenty
thousand
by
five
and
twenty
thousand:
ye
shall
offer
the
holy
oblation
foursquare,
with
the
possession
of
the
city.
048:021
And
the
residue
shall
be
for
the
prince,
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
of
the
holy
oblation,
and
of
the
possession
of
the
city,
over
against
the
five
and
twenty
thousand
of
the
oblation
toward
the
east
border,
and
westward
over
against
the
five
and
twenty
thousand
toward
the
west
border,
over
against
the
portions
for
the
prince:
and
it
shall
be
the
holy
oblation;
and
the
sanctuary
of
the
house
shall
be
in
the
midst
thereof.
048:022
Moreover
from
the
possession
of
the
Levites,
and
from
the
possession
of
the
city,
being
in
the
midst
of
that
which
is
the
prince's,
between
the
border
of
Judah
and
the
border
of
Benjamin,
shall
be
for
the
prince.
048:023
As
for
the
rest
of
the
tribes,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
Benjamin
shall
have
a
portion.
048:024
And
by
the
border
of
Benjamin,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
Simeon
shall
have
a
portion.
048:025
And
by
the
border
of
Simeon,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
Issachar
a
portion.
048:026
And
by
the
border
of
Issachar,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
Zebulun
a
portion.
048:027
And
by
the
border
of
Zebulun,
from
the
east
side
unto
the
west
side,
Gad
a
portion.
048:028
And
by
the
border
of
Gad,
at
the
south
side
southward,
the
border
shall
be
even
from
Tamar
unto
the
waters
of
strife
in
Kadesh,
and
to
the
river
toward
the
great
sea.
048:029
This
is
the
land
which
ye
shall
divide
by
lot
unto
the
tribes
of
Israel
for
inheritance,
and
these
are
their
portions,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
048:030
And
these
are
the
goings
out
of
the
city
on
the
north
side,
four
thousand
and
five
hundred
measures.
048:031
And
the
gates
of
the
city
shall
be
after
the
names
of
the
tribes
of
Israel:
three
gates
northward;
one
gate
of
Reuben,
one
gate
of
Judah,
one
gate
of
Levi.
048:032
And
at
the
east
side
four
thousand
and
five
hundred:
and
three
gates;
and
one
gate
of
Joseph,
one
gate
of
Benjamin,
one
gate
of
Dan.
048:033
And
at
the
south
side
four
thousand
and
five
hundred
measures:
and
three
gates;
one
gate
of
Simeon,
one
gate
of
Issachar,
one
gate
of
Zebulun.
048:034
At
the
west
side
four
thousand
and
five
hundred,
with
their
three
gates;
one
gate
of
Gad,
one
gate
of
Asher,
one
gate
of
Naphtali.
048:035
It
was
round
about
eighteen
thousand
measures:
and
the
name
of
the
city
from
that
day
shall
be,
The
LORD
is
there.
Book
27	Daniel
001:001
In
the
third
year
of
the
reign
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah
came
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
unto
Jerusalem,
and
besieged
it.
001:002
And
the
Lord
gave
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah
into
his
hand,
with
part
of
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
God:
which
he
carried
into
the
land
of
Shinar
to
the
house
of
his
god;
and
he
brought
the
vessels
into
the
treasure
house
of
his
god.
001:003
And
the
king
spake
unto
Ashpenaz
the
master
of
his
eunuchs,
that
he
should
bring
certain
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
of
the
king's
seed,
and
of
the
princes;
001:004
Children
in
whom
was
no
blemish,
but
well
favoured,
and
skilful
in
all
wisdom,
and
cunning
in
knowledge,
and
understanding
science,
and
such
as
had
ability
in
them
to
stand
in
the
king's
palace,
and
whom
they
might
teach
the
learning
and
the
tongue
of
the
Chaldeans.
001:005
And
the
king
appointed
them
a
daily
provision
of
the
king's
meat,
and
of
the
wine
which
he
drank:
so
nourishing
them
three
years,
that
at
the
end
thereof
they
might
stand
before
the
king.
001:006
Now
among
these
were
of
the
children
of
Judah,
Daniel,
Hananiah,
Mishael,
and
Azariah:
001:007
Unto
whom
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
gave
names:
for
he
gave
unto
Daniel
the
name
of
Belteshazzar;
and
to
Hananiah,
of
Shadrach;
and
to
Mishael,
of
Meshach;
and
to
Azariah,
of
Abednego.
001:008
But
Daniel
purposed
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
defile
himself
with
the
portion
of
the
king's
meat,
nor
with
the
wine
which
he
drank:
therefore
he
requested
of
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
that
he
might
not
defile
himself.
001:009
Now
God
had
brought
Daniel
into
favour
and
tender
love
with
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs.
001:010
And
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
said
unto
Daniel,
I
fear
my
lord
the
king,
who
hath
appointed
your
meat
and
your
drink:
for
why
should
he
see
your
faces
worse
liking
than
the
children
which
are
of
your
sort?
then
shall
ye
make
me
endanger
my
head
to
the
king.
001:011
Then
said
Daniel
to
Melzar,
whom
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
had
set
over
Daniel,
Hananiah,
Mishael,
and
Azariah,
001:012
Prove
thy
servants,
I
beseech
thee,
ten
days;
and
let
them
give
us
pulse
to
eat,
and
water
to
drink.
001:013
Then
let
our
countenances
be
looked
upon
before
thee,
and
the
countenance
of
the
children
that
eat
of
the
portion
of
the
king's
meat:
and
as
thou
seest,
deal
with
thy
servants.
001:014
So
he
consented
to
them
in
this
matter,
and
proved
them
ten
days.
001:015
And
at
the
end
of
ten
days
their
countenances
appeared
fairer
and
fatter
in
flesh
than
all
the
children
which
did
eat
the
portion
of
the
king's
meat.
001:016
Thus
Melzar
took
away
the
portion
of
their
