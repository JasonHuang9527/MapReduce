meat,
and
the
wine
that
they
should
drink;
and
gave
them
pulse.
001:017
As
for
these
four
children,
God
gave
them
knowledge
and
skill
in
all
learning
and
wisdom:
and
Daniel
had
understanding
in
all
visions
and
dreams.
001:018
Now
at
the
end
of
the
days
that
the
king
had
said
he
should
bring
them
in,
then
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
brought
them
in
before
Nebuchadnezzar.
001:019
And
the
king
communed
with
them;
and
among
them
all
was
found
none
like
Daniel,
Hananiah,
Mishael,
and
Azariah:
therefore
stood
they
before
the
king.
001:020
And
in
all
matters
of
wisdom
and
understanding,
that
the
king
enquired
of
them,
he
found
them
ten
times
better
than
all
the
magicians
and
astrologers
that
were
in
all
his
realm.
001:021
And
Daniel
continued
even
unto
the
first
year
of
king
Cyrus.
002:001
And
in
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar
dreamed
dreams,
wherewith
his
spirit
was
troubled,
and
his
sleep
brake
from
him.
002:002
Then
the
king
commanded
to
call
the
magicians,
and
the
astrologers,
and
the
sorcerers,
and
the
Chaldeans,
for
to
shew
the
king
his
dreams.
So
they
came
and
stood
before
the
king.
002:003
And
the
king
said
unto
them,
I
have
dreamed
a
dream,
and
my
spirit
was
troubled
to
know
the
dream.
002:004
Then
spake
the
Chaldeans
to
the
king
in
Syriack,
O
king,
live
for
ever:
tell
thy
servants
the
dream,
and
we
will
shew
the
interpretation.
002:005
The
king
answered
and
said
to
the
Chaldeans,
The
thing
is
gone
from
me:
if
ye
will
not
make
known
unto
me
the
dream,
with
the
interpretation
thereof,
ye
shall
be
cut
in
pieces,
and
your
houses
shall
be
made
a
dunghill.
002:006
But
if
ye
shew
the
dream,
and
the
interpretation
thereof,
ye
shall
receive
of
me
gifts
and
rewards
and
great
honour:
therefore
shew
me
the
dream,
and
the
interpretation
thereof.
002:007
They
answered
again
and
said,
Let
the
king
tell
his
servants
the
dream,
and
we
will
shew
the
interpretation
of
it.
002:008
The
king
answered
and
said,
I
know
of
certainty
that
ye
would
gain
the
time,
because
ye
see
the
thing
is
gone
from
me.
002:009
But
if
ye
will
not
make
known
unto
me
the
dream,
there
is
but
one
decree
for
you:
for
ye
have
prepared
lying
and
corrupt
words
to
speak
before
me,
till
the
time
be
changed:
therefore
tell
me
the
dream,
and
I
shall
know
that
ye
can
shew
me
the
interpretation
thereof.
002:010
The
Chaldeans
answered
before
the
king,
and
said,
There
is
not
a
man
upon
the
earth
that
can
shew
the
king's
matter:
therefore
there
is
no
king,
lord,
nor
ruler,
that
asked
such
things
at
any
magician,
or
astrologer,
or
Chaldean.
002:011
And
it
is
a
rare
thing
that
the
king
requireth,
and
there
is
none
other
that
can
shew
it
before
the
king,
except
the
gods,
whose
dwelling
is
not
with
flesh.
002:012
For
this
cause
the
king
was
angry
and
very
furious,
and
commanded
to
destroy
all
the
wise
men
of
Babylon.
002:013
And
the
decree
went
forth
that
the
wise
men
should
be
slain;
and
they
sought
Daniel
and
his
fellows
to
be
slain.
002:014
Then
Daniel
answered
with
counsel
and
wisdom
to
Arioch
the
captain
of
the
king's
guard,
which
was
gone
forth
to
slay
the
wise
men
of
Babylon:
002:015
He
answered
and
said
to
Arioch
the
king's
captain,
Why
is
the
decree
so
hasty
from
the
king?
Then
Arioch
made
the
thing
known
to
Daniel.
002:016
Then
Daniel
went
in,
and
desired
of
the
king
that
he
would
give
him
time,
and
that
he
would
shew
the
king
the
interpretation.
002:017
Then
Daniel
went
to
his
house,
and
made
the
thing
known
to
Hananiah,
Mishael,
and
Azariah,
his
companions:
002:018
That
they
would
desire
mercies
of
the
God
of
heaven
concerning
this
secret;
that
Daniel
and
his
fellows
should
not
perish
with
the
rest
of
the
wise
men
of
Babylon.
002:019
Then
was
the
secret
revealed
unto
Daniel
in
a
night
vision.
Then
Daniel
blessed
the
God
of
heaven.
002:020
Daniel
answered
and
said,
Blessed
be
the
name
of
God
for
ever
and
ever:
for
wisdom
and
might
are
his:
002:021
And
he
changeth
the
times
and
the
seasons:
he
removeth
kings,
and
setteth
up
kings:
he
giveth
wisdom
unto
the
wise,
and
knowledge
to
them
that
know
understanding:
002:022
He
revealeth
the
deep
and
secret
things:
he
knoweth
what
is
in
the
darkness,
and
the
light
dwelleth
with
him.
002:023
I
thank
thee,
and
praise
thee,
O
thou
God
of
my
fathers,
who
hast
given
me
wisdom
and
might,
and
hast
made
known
unto
me
now
what
we
desired
of
thee:
for
thou
hast
now
made
known
unto
us
the
king's
matter.
002:024
Therefore
Daniel
went
in
unto
Arioch,
whom
the
king
had
ordained
to
destroy
the
wise
men
of
Babylon:
he
went
and
said
thus
unto
him;
Destroy
not
the
wise
men
of
Babylon:
bring
me
in
before
the
king,
and
I
will
shew
unto
the
king
the
interpretation.
002:025
Then
Arioch
brought
in
Daniel
before
the
king
in
haste,
and
said
thus
unto
him,
I
have
found
a
man
of
the
captives
of
Judah,
that
will
make
known
unto
the
king
the
interpretation.
002:026
The
king
answered
and
said
to
Daniel,
whose
name
was
Belteshazzar,
Art
thou
able
to
make
known
unto
me
the
dream
which
I
have
seen,
and
the
interpretation
thereof?
002:027
Daniel
answered
in
the
presence
of
the
king,
and
said,
The
secret
which
the
king
hath
demanded
cannot
the
wise
men,
the
astrologers,
the
magicians,
the
soothsayers,
shew
unto
the
king;
002:028
But
there
is
a
God
in
heaven
that
revealeth
secrets,
and
maketh
known
to
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar
what
shall
be
in
the
latter
days.
Thy
dream,
and
the
visions
of
thy
head
upon
thy
bed,
are
these;
002:029
As
for
thee,
O
king,
thy
thoughts
came
into
thy
mind
upon
thy
bed,
what
should
come
to
pass
hereafter:
and
he
that
revealeth
secrets
maketh
known
to
thee
what
shall
come
to
pass.
002:030
But
as
for
me,
this
secret
is
not
revealed
to
me
for
any
wisdom
that
I
have
more
than
any
living,
but
for
their
sakes
that
shall
make
known
the
interpretation
to
the
king,
and
that
thou
mightest
know
the
thoughts
of
thy
heart.
002:031
Thou,
O
king,
sawest,
and
behold
a
great
image.
This
great
image,
whose
brightness
was
excellent,
stood
before
thee;
and
the
form
thereof
was
terrible.
002:032
This
image's
head
was
of
fine
gold,
his
breast
and
his
arms
of
silver,
his
belly
and
his
thighs
of
brass,
002:033
His
legs
of
iron,
his
feet
part
of
iron
and
part
of
clay.
002:034
Thou
sawest
till
that
a
stone
was
cut
out
without
hands,
which
smote
the
image
upon
his
feet
that
were
of
iron
and
clay,
and
brake
them
to
pieces.
002:035
Then
was
the
iron,
the
clay,
the
brass,
the
silver,
and
the
gold,
broken
to
pieces
together,
and
became
like
the
chaff
of
the
summer
threshingfloors;
and
the
wind
carried
them
away,
that
no
place
was
found
for
them:
and
the
stone
that
smote
the
image
became
a
great
mountain,
and
filled
the
whole
earth.
002:036
This
is
the
dream;
and
we
will
tell
the
interpretation
thereof
before
the
king.
002:037
Thou,
O
king,
art
a
king
of
kings:
for
the
God
of
heaven
hath
given
thee
a
kingdom,
power,
and
strength,
and
glory.
002:038
And
wheresoever
the
children
of
men
dwell,
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
hath
he
given
into
thine
hand,
and
hath
made
thee
ruler
over
them
all.
Thou
art
this
head
of
gold.
002:039
And
after
thee
shall
arise
another
kingdom
inferior
to
thee,
and
another
third
kingdom
of
brass,
which
shall
bear
rule
over
all
the
earth.
002:040
And
the
fourth
kingdom
shall
be
strong
as
iron:
forasmuch
as
iron
breaketh
in
pieces
and
subdueth
all
things:
and
as
iron
that
breaketh
all
these,
shall
it
break
in
pieces
and
bruise.
002:041
And
whereas
thou
sawest
the
feet
and
toes,
part
of
potters'
clay,
and
part
of
iron,
the
kingdom
shall
be
divided;
but
there
shall
be
in
it
of
the
strength
of
the
iron,
forasmuch
as
thou
sawest
the
iron
mixed
with
miry
clay.
002:042
And
as
the
toes
of
the
feet
were
part
of
iron,
and
part
of
clay,
so
the
kingdom
shall
be
partly
strong,
and
partly
broken.
002:043
And
whereas
thou
sawest
iron
mixed
with
miry
clay,
they
shall
mingle
themselves
with
the
seed
of
men:
but
they
shall
not
cleave
one
to
another,
even
as
iron
is
not
mixed
with
clay.
002:044
And
in
the
days
of
these
kings
shall
the
God
of
heaven
set
up
a
kingdom,
which
shall
never
be
destroyed:
and
the
kingdom
shall
not
be
left
to
other
people,
but
it
shall
break
in
pieces
and
consume
all
these
kingdoms,
and
it
shall
stand
for
ever.
002:045
Forasmuch
as
thou
sawest
that
the
stone
was
cut
out
of
the
mountain
without
hands,
and
that
it
brake
in
pieces
the
iron,
the
brass,
the
clay,
the
silver,
and
the
gold;
the
great
God
hath
made
known
to
the
king
what
shall
come
to
pass
hereafter:
and
the
dream
is
certain,
and
the
interpretation
thereof
sure.
002:046
Then
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar
fell
upon
his
face,
and
worshipped
Daniel,
and
commanded
that
they
should
offer
an
oblation
and
sweet
odours
unto
him.
002:047
The
king
answered
unto
Daniel,
and
said,
Of
a
truth
it
is,
that
your
God
is
a
God
of
gods,
and
a
Lord
of
kings,
and
a
revealer
of
secrets,
seeing
thou
couldest
reveal
this
secret.
002:048
Then
the
king
made
Daniel
a
great
man,
and
gave
him
many
great
gifts,
and
made
him
ruler
over
the
whole
province
of
Babylon,
and
chief
of
the
governors
over
all
the
wise
men
of
Babylon.
002:049
Then
Daniel
requested
of
the
king,
and
he
set
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
over
the
affairs
of
the
province
of
Babylon:
but
Daniel
sat
in
the
gate
of
the
king.
003:001
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
made
an
image
of
gold,
whose
height
was
threescore
cubits,
and
the
breadth
thereof
six
cubits:
he
set
it
up
in
the
plain
of
Dura,
in
the
province
of
Babylon.
003:002
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
sent
to
gather
together
the
princes,
the
governors,
and
the
captains,
the
judges,
the
treasurers,
the
counsellors,
the
sheriffs,
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces,
to
come
to
the
dedication
of
the
image
which
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up.
003:003
Then
the
princes,
the
governors,
and
captains,
the
judges,
the
treasurers,
the
counsellors,
the
sheriffs,
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces,
were
gathered
together
unto
the
dedication
of
the
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up;
and
they
stood
before
the
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
had
set
up.
003:004
Then
an
herald
cried
aloud,
To
you
it
is
commanded,
O
people,
nations,
and
languages,
003:005
That
at
what
time
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet,
flute,
harp,
sackbut,
psaltery,
dulcimer,
and
all
kinds
of
musick,
ye
fall
down
and
worship
the
golden
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
hath
set
up:
003:006
And
whoso
falleth
not
down
and
worshippeth
shall
the
same
hour
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace.
003:007
Therefore
at
that
time,
when
all
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
cornet,
flute,
harp,
sackbut,
psaltery,
and
all
kinds
of
musick,
all
the
people,
the
nations,
and
the
languages,
fell
down
and
worshipped
the
golden
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up.
003:008
Wherefore
at
that
time
certain
Chaldeans
came
near,
and
accused
the
Jews.
003:009
They
spake
and
said
to
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar,
O
king,
live
for
ever.
003:010
Thou,
O
king,
hast
made
a
decree,
that
every
man
that
shall
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet,
flute,
harp,
sackbut,
psaltery,
and
dulcimer,
and
all
kinds
of
musick,
shall
fall
down
and
worship
the
golden
image:
003:011
And
whoso
falleth
not
down
and
worshippeth,
that
he
should
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace.
003:012
There
are
certain
Jews
whom
thou
hast
set
over
the
affairs
of
the
province
of
Babylon,
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego;
these
men,
O
king,
have
not
regarded
thee:
they
serve
not
thy
gods,
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
set
up.
003:013
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
in
his
rage
and
fury
commanded
to
bring
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego.
Then
they
brought
these
men
before
the
king.
003:014
Nebuchadnezzar
spake
and
said
unto
them,
Is
it
true,
O
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
do
not
ye
serve
my
gods,
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
I
have
set
up?
003:015
Now
if
ye
be
ready
that
at
what
time
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet,
flute,
harp,
sackbut,
psaltery,
and
dulcimer,
and
all
kinds
of
musick,
ye
fall
down
and
worship
the
image
which
I
have
made;
well:
but
if
ye
worship
not,
ye
shall
be
cast
the
same
hour
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace;
and
who
is
that
God
that
shall
deliver
you
out
of
my
hands?
003:016
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
answered
and
said
to
the
king,
O
Nebuchadnezzar,
we
are
not
careful
to
answer
thee
in
this
matter.
003:017
If
it
be
so,
our
God
whom
we
serve
is
able
to
deliver
us
from
the
burning
fiery
furnace,
and
he
will
deliver
us
out
of
thine
hand,
O
king.
003:018
But
if
not,
be
it
known
unto
thee,
O
king,
that
we
will
not
serve
thy
gods,
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
set
up.
003:019
Then
was
Nebuchadnezzar
full
of
fury,
and
the
form
of
his
visage
was
changed
against
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego:
therefore
he
spake,
and
commanded
that
they
should
heat
the
furnace
one
seven
times
more
than
it
was
wont
to
be
heated.
003:020
And
he
commanded
the
most
mighty
men
that
were
in
his
army
to
bind
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
and
to
cast
them
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace.
003:021
Then
these
men
were
bound
in
their
coats,
their
hosen,
and
their
hats,
and
their
other
garments,
and
were
cast
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace.
003:022
Therefore
because
the
king's
commandment
was
urgent,
and
the
furnace
exceeding
hot,
the
flames
of
the
fire
slew
those
men
that
took
up
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego.
003:023
And
these
three
men,
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
fell
down
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace.
003:024
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
was
astonied,
and
rose
up
in
haste,
and
spake,
and
said
unto
his
counsellors,
Did
not
we
cast
three
men
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
fire?
They
answered
and
said
unto
the
king,
True,
O
king.
003:025
He
answered
and
said,
Lo,
I
see
four
men
loose,
walking
in
the
midst
of
the
fire,
and
they
have
no
hurt;
and
the
form
of
the
fourth
is
like
the
Son
of
God.
003:026
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
came
near
to
the
mouth
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace,
and
spake,
and
said,
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
ye
servants
of
the
most
high
God,
come
forth,
and
come
hither.
Then
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
came
forth
of
the
midst
of
the
fire.
003:027
And
the
princes,
governors,
and
captains,
and
the
king's
counsellors,
being
gathered
together,
saw
these
men,
upon
whose
bodies
the
fire
had
no
power,
nor
was
an
hair
of
their
head
singed,
neither
were
their
coats
changed,
nor
the
smell
of
fire
had
passed
on
them.
003:028
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
spake,
and
said,
Blessed
be
the
God
of
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
who
hath
sent
his
angel,
and
delivered
his
servants
that
trusted
in
him,
and
have
changed
the
king's
word,
and
yielded
their
bodies,
that
they
might
not
serve
nor
worship
any
god,
except
their
own
God.
003:029
Therefore
I
make
a
decree,
That
every
people,
nation,
and
language,
which
speak
any
thing
amiss
against
the
God
of
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
shall
be
cut
in
pieces,
and
their
houses
shall
be
made
a
dunghill:
because
there
is
no
other
God
that
can
deliver
after
this
sort.
003:030
Then
the
king
promoted
Shadrach,
Meshach,
and
Abednego,
in
the
province
of
Babylon.
004:001
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king,
unto
all
people,
nations,
and
languages,
that
dwell
in
all
the
earth;
Peace
be
multiplied
unto
you.
004:002
I
thought
it
good
to
shew
the
signs
and
wonders
that
the
high
God
hath
wrought
toward
me.
004:003
How
great
are
his
signs!
and
how
mighty
are
his
wonders!
his
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom,
and
his
dominion
is
from
generation
to
generation.
004:004
I
Nebuchadnezzar
was
at
rest
in
mine
house,
and
flourishing
in
my
palace:
004:005
I
saw
a
dream
which
made
me
afraid,
and
the
thoughts
upon
my
bed
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
me.
004:006
Therefore
made
I
a
decree
to
bring
in
all
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
before
me,
that
they
might
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
of
the
dream.
004:007
Then
came
in
the
magicians,
the
astrologers,
the
Chaldeans,
and
the
soothsayers:
and
I
told
the
dream
before
them;
but
they
did
not
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
thereof.
004:008
But
at
the
last
Daniel
came
in
before
me,
whose
name
was
Belteshazzar,
according
to
the
name
of
my
God,
and
in
whom
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods:
and
before
him
I
told
the
dream,
saying,
004:009
O
Belteshazzar,
master
of
the
magicians,
because
I
know
that
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
is
in
thee,
and
no
secret
troubleth
thee,
tell
me
the
visions
of
my
dream
that
I
have
seen,
and
the
interpretation
thereof.
004:010
Thus
were
the
visions
of
mine
head
in
my
bed;
I
saw,
and
behold
a
tree
in
the
midst
of
the
earth,
and
the
height
thereof
was
great.
004:011
The
tree
grew,
and
was
strong,
and
the
height
thereof
reached
unto
heaven,
and
the
sight
thereof
to
the
end
of
all
the
earth:
004:012
The
leaves
thereof
were
fair,
and
the
fruit
thereof
much,
and
in
it
was
meat
for
all:
the
beasts
of
the
field
had
shadow
under
it,
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
dwelt
in
the
boughs
thereof,
and
all
flesh
was
fed
of
it.
004:013
I
saw
in
the
visions
of
my
head
upon
my
bed,
and,
behold,
a
watcher
and
an
holy
one
came
down
from
heaven;
004:014
He
cried
aloud,
and
said
thus,
Hew
down
the
tree,
and
cut
off
his
branches,
shake
off
his
leaves,
and
scatter
his
fruit:
let
the
beasts
get
away
from
under
it,
and
the
fowls
from
his
branches:
004:015
Nevertheless
leave
the
stump
of
his
roots
in
the
earth,
even
with
a
band
of
iron
and
brass,
in
the
tender
grass
of
the
field;
and
let
it
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven,
and
let
his
portion
be
with
the
beasts
in
the
grass
of
the
earth:
004:016
Let
his
heart
be
changed
from
man's,
and
let
a
beast's
heart
be
given
unto
him;
and
let
seven
times
pass
over
him.
004:017
This
matter
is
by
the
decree
of
the
watchers,
and
the
demand
by
the
word
of
the
holy
ones:
to
the
intent
that
the
living
may
know
that
the
most
High
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men,
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will,
and
setteth
up
over
it
the
basest
of
men.
004:018
This
dream
I
king
Nebuchadnezzar
have
seen.
Now
thou,
O
Belteshazzar,
declare
the
interpretation
thereof,
forasmuch
as
all
the
wise
men
of
my
kingdom
are
not
able
to
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation:
but
thou
art
able;
for
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
is
in
thee.
004:019
Then
Daniel,
whose
name
was
Belteshazzar,
was
astonied
for
one
hour,
and
his
thoughts
troubled
him.
The
king
spake,
and
said,
Belteshazzar,
let
not
the
dream,
or
the
interpretation
thereof,
trouble
thee.
Belteshazzar
answered
and
said,
My
lord,
the
dream
be
to
them
that
hate
thee,
and
the
interpretation
thereof
to
thine
enemies.
004:020
The
tree
that
thou
sawest,
which
grew,
and
was
strong,
whose
height
reached
unto
the
heaven,
and
the
sight
thereof
to
all
the
earth;
004:021
Whose
leaves
were
fair,
and
the
fruit
thereof
much,
and
in
it
was
meat
for
all;
under
which
the
beasts
of
the
field
dwelt,
and
upon
whose
branches
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
had
their
habitation:
004:022
It
is
thou,
O
king,
that
art
grown
and
become
strong:
for
thy
greatness
is
grown,
and
reacheth
unto
heaven,
and
thy
dominion
to
the
end
of
the
earth.
004:023
And
whereas
the
king
saw
a
watcher
and
an
holy
one
coming
down
from
heaven,
and
saying,
Hew
the
tree
down,
and
destroy
it;
yet
leave
the
stump
of
the
roots
thereof
in
the
earth,
even
with
a
band
of
iron
and
brass,
in
the
tender
grass
of
the
field;
and
let
it
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven,
and
let
his
portion
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field,
till
seven
times
pass
over
him;
004:024
This
is
the
interpretation,
O
king,
and
this
is
the
decree
of
the
most
High,
which
is
come
upon
my
lord
the
king:
004:025
That
they
shall
drive
thee
from
men,
and
thy
dwelling
shall
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field,
and
they
shall
make
thee
to
eat
grass
as
oxen,
and
they
shall
wet
thee
with
the
dew
of
heaven,
and
seven
times
shall
pass
over
thee,
till
thou
know
that
the
most
High
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men,
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will.
004:026
And
whereas
they
commanded
to
leave
the
stump
of
the
tree
roots;
thy
kingdom
shall
be
sure
unto
thee,
after
that
thou
shalt
have
known
that
the
heavens
do
rule.
004:027
Wherefore,
O
king,
let
my
counsel
be
acceptable
unto
thee,
and
break
off
thy
sins
by
righteousness,
and
thine
iniquities
by
shewing
mercy
to
the
poor;
if
it
may
be
a
lengthening
of
thy
tranquillity.
004:028
All
this
came
upon
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar.
004:029
At
the
end
of
twelve
months
he
walked
in
the
palace
of
the
kingdom
of
Babylon.
004:030
The
king
spake,
and
said,
Is
not
this
great
Babylon,
that
I
have
built
for
the
house
of
the
kingdom
by
the
might
of
my
power,
and
for
the
honour
of
my
majesty?
004:031
While
the
word
was
in
the
king's
mouth,
there
fell
a
voice
from
heaven,
saying,
O
king
Nebuchadnezzar,
to
thee
it
is
spoken;
The
kingdom
is
departed
from
thee.
004:032
And
they
shall
drive
thee
from
men,
and
thy
dwelling
shall
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field:
they
shall
make
thee
to
eat
grass
as
oxen,
and
seven
times
shall
pass
over
thee,
until
thou
know
that
the
most
High
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men,
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will.
004:033
The
same
hour
was
the
thing
fulfilled
upon
Nebuchadnezzar:
and
he
was
driven
from
men,
and
did
eat
grass
as
oxen,
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven,
till
his
hairs
were
grown
like
eagles'
feathers,
and
his
nails
like
birds'
claws.
004:034
And
at
the
end
of
the
days
I
Nebuchadnezzar
lifted
up
mine
eyes
unto
heaven,
and
mine
understanding
returned
unto
me,
and
I
blessed
the
most
High,
and
I
praised
and
honoured
him
that
liveth
for
ever,
whose
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion,
and
his
kingdom
is
from
generation
to
generation:
004:035
And
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
reputed
as
nothing:
and
he
doeth
according
to
his
will
in
the
army
of
heaven,
and
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth:
and
none
can
stay
his
hand,
or
say
unto
him,
What
doest
thou?
004:036
At
the
same
time
my
reason
returned
unto
me;
and
for
the
glory
of
my
kingdom,
mine
honour
and
brightness
returned
unto
me;
and
my
counsellors
and
my
lords
sought
unto
me;
and
I
was
established
in
my
kingdom,
and
excellent
majesty
was
added
unto
me.
004:037
Now
I
Nebuchadnezzar
praise
and
extol
and
honour
the
King
of
heaven,
all
whose
works
are
truth,
and
his
ways
judgment:
and
those
that
walk
in
pride
he
is
able
to
abase.
005:001
Belshazzar
the
king
made
a
great
feast
to
a
thousand
of
his
lords,
and
drank
wine
before
the
thousand.
005:002
Belshazzar,
whiles
he
tasted
the
wine,
commanded
to
bring
the
golden
and
silver
vessels
which
his
father
Nebuchadnezzar
had
taken
out
of
the
temple
which
was
in
Jerusalem;
that
the
king,
and
his
princes,
his
wives,
and
his
concubines,
