might
drink
therein.
005:003
Then
they
brought
the
golden
vessels
that
were
taken
out
of
the
temple
of
the
house
of
God
which
was
at
Jerusalem;
and
the
king,
and
his
princes,
his
wives,
and
his
concubines,
drank
in
them.
005:004
They
drank
wine,
and
praised
the
gods
of
gold,
and
of
silver,
of
brass,
of
iron,
of
wood,
and
of
stone.
005:005
In
the
same
hour
came
forth
fingers
of
a
man's
hand,
and
wrote
over
against
the
candlestick
upon
the
plaister
of
the
wall
of
the
king's
palace:
and
the
king
saw
the
part
of
the
hand
that
wrote.
005:006
Then
the
king's
countenance
was
changed,
and
his
thoughts
troubled
him,
so
that
the
joints
of
his
loins
were
loosed,
and
his
knees
smote
one
against
another.
005:007
The
king
cried
aloud
to
bring
in
the
astrologers,
the
Chaldeans,
and
the
soothsayers.
And
the
king
spake,
and
said
to
the
wise
men
of
Babylon,
Whosoever
shall
read
this
writing,
and
shew
me
the
interpretation
thereof,
shall
be
clothed
with
scarlet,
and
have
a
chain
of
gold
about
his
neck,
and
shall
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom.
005:008
Then
came
in
all
the
king's
wise
men:
but
they
could
not
read
the
writing,
nor
make
known
to
the
king
the
interpretation
thereof.
005:009
Then
was
king
Belshazzar
greatly
troubled,
and
his
countenance
was
changed
in
him,
and
his
lords
were
astonied.
005:010
Now
the
queen
by
reason
of
the
words
of
the
king
and
his
lords
came
into
the
banquet
house:
and
the
queen
spake
and
said,
O
king,
live
for
ever:
let
not
thy
thoughts
trouble
thee,
nor
let
thy
countenance
be
changed:
005:011
There
is
a
man
in
thy
kingdom,
in
whom
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods;
and
in
the
days
of
thy
father
light
and
understanding
and
wisdom,
like
the
wisdom
of
the
gods,
was
found
in
him;
whom
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar
thy
father,
the
king,
I
say,
thy
father,
made
master
of
the
magicians,
astrologers,
Chaldeans,
and
soothsayers;
005:012
Forasmuch
as
an
excellent
spirit,
and
knowledge,
and
understanding,
interpreting
of
dreams,
and
shewing
of
hard
sentences,
and
dissolving
of
doubts,
were
found
in
the
same
Daniel,
whom
the
king
named
Belteshazzar:
now
let
Daniel
be
called,
and
he
will
shew
the
interpretation.
005:013
Then
was
Daniel
brought
in
before
the
king.
And
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
Daniel,
Art
thou
that
Daniel,
which
art
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
Judah,
whom
the
king
my
father
brought
out
of
Jewry?
005:014
I
have
even
heard
of
thee,
that
the
spirit
of
the
gods
is
in
thee,
and
that
light
and
understanding
and
excellent
wisdom
is
found
in
thee.
005:015
And
now
the
wise
men,
the
astrologers,
have
been
brought
in
before
me,
that
they
should
read
this
writing,
and
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
thereof:
but
they
could
not
shew
the
interpretation
of
the
thing:
005:016
And
I
have
heard
of
thee,
that
thou
canst
make
interpretations,
and
dissolve
doubts:
now
if
thou
canst
read
the
writing,
and
make
known
to
me
the
interpretation
thereof,
thou
shalt
be
clothed
with
scarlet,
and
have
a
chain
of
gold
about
thy
neck,
and
shalt
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom.
005:017
Then
Daniel
answered
and
said
before
the
king,
Let
thy
gifts
be
to
thyself,
and
give
thy
rewards
to
another;
yet
I
will
read
the
writing
unto
the
king,
and
make
known
to
him
the
interpretation.
005:018
O
thou
king,
the
most
high
God
gave
Nebuchadnezzar
thy
father
a
kingdom,
and
majesty,
and
glory,
and
honour:
005:019
And
for
the
majesty
that
he
gave
him,
all
people,
nations,
and
languages,
trembled
and
feared
before
him:
whom
he
would
he
slew;
and
whom
he
would
he
kept
alive;
and
whom
he
would
he
set
up;
and
whom
he
would
he
put
down.
005:020
But
when
his
heart
was
lifted
up,
and
his
mind
hardened
in
pride,
he
was
deposed
from
his
kingly
throne,
and
they
took
his
glory
from
him:
005:021
And
he
was
driven
from
the
sons
of
men;
and
his
heart
was
made
like
the
beasts,
and
his
dwelling
was
with
the
wild
asses:
they
fed
him
with
grass
like
oxen,
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven;
till
he
knew
that
the
most
high
God
ruled
in
the
kingdom
of
men,
and
that
he
appointeth
over
it
whomsoever
he
will.
005:022
And
thou
his
son,
O
Belshazzar,
hast
not
humbled
thine
heart,
though
thou
knewest
all
this;
005:023
But
hast
lifted
up
thyself
against
the
Lord
of
heaven;
and
they
have
brought
the
vessels
of
his
house
before
thee,
and
thou,
and
thy
lords,
thy
wives,
and
thy
concubines,
have
drunk
wine
in
them;
and
thou
hast
praised
the
gods
of
silver,
and
gold,
of
brass,
iron,
wood,
and
stone,
which
see
not,
nor
hear,
nor
know:
and
the
God
in
whose
hand
thy
breath
is,
and
whose
are
all
thy
ways,
hast
thou
not
glorified:
005:024
Then
was
the
part
of
the
hand
sent
from
him;
and
this
writing
was
written.
005:025
And
this
is
the
writing
that
was
written,
MENE,
MENE,
TEKEL,
UPHARSIN.
005:026
This
is
the
interpretation
of
the
thing:
MENE;
God
hath
numbered
thy
kingdom,
and
finished
it.
005:027
TEKEL;
Thou
art
weighed
in
the
balances,
and
art
found
wanting.
005:028
PERES;
Thy
kingdom
is
divided,
and
given
to
the
Medes
and
Persians.
005:029
Then
commanded
Belshazzar,
and
they
clothed
Daniel
with
scarlet,
and
put
a
chain
of
gold
about
his
neck,
and
made
a
proclamation
concerning
him,
that
he
should
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom.
005:030
In
that
night
was
Belshazzar
the
king
of
the
Chaldeans
slain.
005:031
And
Darius
the
Median
took
the
kingdom,
being
about
threescore
and
two
years
old.
006:001
It
pleased
Darius
to
set
over
the
kingdom
an
hundred
and
twenty
princes,
which
should
be
over
the
whole
kingdom;
006:002
And
over
these
three
presidents;
of
whom
Daniel
was
first:
that
the
princes
might
give
accounts
unto
them,
and
the
king
should
have
no
damage.
006:003
Then
this
Daniel
was
preferred
above
the
presidents
and
princes,
because
an
excellent
spirit
was
in
him;
and
the
king
thought
to
set
him
over
the
whole
realm.
006:004
Then
the
presidents
and
princes
sought
to
find
occasion
against
Daniel
concerning
the
kingdom;
but
they
could
find
none
occasion
nor
fault;
forasmuch
as
he
was
faithful,
neither
was
there
any
error
or
fault
found
in
him.
006:005
Then
said
these
men,
We
shall
not
find
any
occasion
against
this
Daniel,
except
we
find
it
against
him
concerning
the
law
of
his
God.
006:006
Then
these
presidents
and
princes
assembled
together
to
the
king,
and
said
thus
unto
him,
King
Darius,
live
for
ever.
006:007
All
the
presidents
of
the
kingdom,
the
governors,
and
the
princes,
the
counsellors,
and
the
captains,
have
consulted
together
to
establish
a
royal
statute,
and
to
make
a
firm
decree,
that
whosoever
shall
ask
a
petition
of
any
God
or
man
for
thirty
days,
save
of
thee,
O
king,
he
shall
be
cast
into
the
den
of
lions.
006:008
Now,
O
king,
establish
the
decree,
and
sign
the
writing,
that
it
be
not
changed,
according
to
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
Persians,
which
altereth
not.
006:009
Wherefore
king
Darius
signed
the
writing
and
the
decree.
006:010
Now
when
Daniel
knew
that
the
writing
was
signed,
he
went
into
his
house;
and
his
windows
being
open
in
his
chamber
toward
Jerusalem,
he
kneeled
upon
his
knees
three
times
a
day,
and
prayed,
and
gave
thanks
before
his
God,
as
he
did
aforetime.
006:011
Then
these
men
assembled,
and
found
Daniel
praying
and
making
supplication
before
his
God.
006:012
Then
they
came
near,
and
spake
before
the
king
concerning
the
king's
decree;
Hast
thou
not
signed
a
decree,
that
every
man
that
shall
ask
a
petition
of
any
God
or
man
within
thirty
days,
save
of
thee,
O
king,
shall
be
cast
into
the
den
of
lions?
The
king
answered
and
said,
The
thing
is
true,
according
to
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
Persians,
which
altereth
not.
006:013
Then
answered
they
and
said
before
the
king,
That
Daniel,
which
is
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
Judah,
regardeth
not
thee,
O
king,
nor
the
decree
that
thou
hast
signed,
but
maketh
his
petition
three
times
a
day.
006:014
Then
the
king,
when
he
heard
these
words,
was
sore
displeased
with
himself,
and
set
his
heart
on
Daniel
to
deliver
him:
and
he
laboured
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
to
deliver
him.
006:015
Then
these
men
assembled
unto
the
king,
and
said
unto
the
king,
Know,
O
king,
that
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
Persians
is,
That
no
decree
nor
statute
which
the
king
establisheth
may
be
changed.
006:016
Then
the
king
commanded,
and
they
brought
Daniel,
and
cast
him
into
the
den
of
lions.
Now
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
Daniel,
Thy
God
whom
thou
servest
continually,
he
will
deliver
thee.
006:017
And
a
stone
was
brought,
and
laid
upon
the
mouth
of
the
den;
and
the
king
sealed
it
with
his
own
signet,
and
with
the
signet
of
his
lords;
that
the
purpose
might
not
be
changed
concerning
Daniel.
006:018
Then
the
king
went
to
his
palace,
and
passed
the
night
fasting:
neither
were
instruments
of
musick
brought
before
him:
and
his
sleep
went
from
him.
006:019
Then
the
king
arose
very
early
in
the
morning,
and
went
in
haste
unto
the
den
of
lions.
006:020
And
when
he
came
to
the
den,
he
cried
with
a
lamentable
voice
unto
Daniel:
and
the
king
spake
and
said
to
Daniel,
O
Daniel,
servant
of
the
living
God,
is
thy
God,
whom
thou
servest
continually,
able
to
deliver
thee
from
the
lions?
006:021
Then
said
Daniel
unto
the
king,
O
king,
live
for
ever.
006:022
My
God
hath
sent
his
angel,
and
hath
shut
the
lions'
mouths,
that
they
have
not
hurt
me:
forasmuch
as
before
him
innocency
was
found
in
me;
and
also
before
thee,
O
king,
have
I
done
no
hurt.
006:023
Then
was
the
king
exceedingly
glad
for
him,
and
commanded
that
they
should
take
Daniel
up
out
of
the
den.
So
Daniel
was
taken
up
out
of
the
den,
and
no
manner
of
hurt
was
found
upon
him,
because
he
believed
in
his
God.
006:024
And
the
king
commanded,
and
they
brought
those
men
which
had
accused
Daniel,
and
they
cast
them
into
the
den
of
lions,
them,
their
children,
and
their
wives;
and
the
lions
had
the
mastery
of
them,
and
brake
all
their
bones
in
pieces
or
ever
they
came
at
the
bottom
of
the
den.
006:025
Then
king
Darius
wrote
unto
all
people,
nations,
and
languages,
that
dwell
in
all
the
earth;
Peace
be
multiplied
unto
you.
006:026
I
make
a
decree,
That
in
every
dominion
of
my
kingdom
men
tremble
and
fear
before
the
God
of
Daniel:
for
he
is
the
living
God,
and
stedfast
for
ever,
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed,
and
his
dominion
shall
be
even
unto
the
end.
006:027
He
delivereth
and
rescueth,
and
he
worketh
signs
and
wonders
in
heaven
and
in
earth,
who
hath
delivered
Daniel
from
the
power
of
the
lions.
006:028
So
this
Daniel
prospered
in
the
reign
of
Darius,
and
in
the
reign
of
Cyrus
the
Persian.
007:001
In
the
first
year
of
Belshazzar
king
of
Babylon
Daniel
had
a
dream
and
visions
of
his
head
upon
his
bed:
then
he
wrote
the
dream,
and
told
the
sum
of
the
matters.
007:002
Daniel
spake
and
said,
I
saw
in
my
vision
by
night,
and,
behold,
the
four
winds
of
the
heaven
strove
upon
the
great
sea.
007:003
And
four
great
beasts
came
up
from
the
sea,
diverse
one
from
another.
007:004
The
first
was
like
a
lion,
and
had
eagle's
wings:
I
beheld
till
the
wings
thereof
were
plucked,
and
it
was
lifted
up
from
the
earth,
and
made
stand
upon
the
feet
as
a
man,
and
a
man's
heart
was
given
to
it.
007:005
And
behold
another
beast,
a
second,
like
to
a
bear,
and
it
raised
up
itself
on
one
side,
and
it
had
three
ribs
in
the
mouth
of
it
between
the
teeth
of
it:
and
they
said
thus
unto
it,
Arise,
devour
much
flesh.
007:006
After
this
I
beheld,
and
lo
another,
like
a
leopard,
which
had
upon
the
back
of
it
four
wings
of
a
fowl;
the
beast
had
also
four
heads;
and
dominion
was
given
to
it.
007:007
After
this
I
saw
in
the
night
visions,
and
behold
a
fourth
beast,
dreadful
and
terrible,
and
strong
exceedingly;
and
it
had
great
iron
teeth:
it
devoured
and
brake
in
pieces,
and
stamped
the
residue
with
the
feet
of
it:
and
it
was
diverse
from
all
the
beasts
that
were
before
it;
and
it
had
ten
horns.
007:008
I
considered
the
horns,
and,
behold,
there
came
up
among
them
another
little
horn,
before
whom
there
were
three
of
the
first
horns
plucked
up
by
the
roots:
and,
behold,
in
this
horn
were
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
man,
and
a
mouth
speaking
great
things.
007:009
I
beheld
till
the
thrones
were
cast
down,
and
the
Ancient
of
days
did
sit,
whose
garment
was
white
as
snow,
and
the
hair
of
his
head
like
the
pure
wool:
his
throne
was
like
the
fiery
flame,
and
his
wheels
as
burning
fire.
007:010
A
fiery
stream
issued
and
came
forth
from
before
him:
thousand
thousands
ministered
unto
him,
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
stood
before
him:
the
judgment
was
set,
and
the
books
were
opened.
007:011
I
beheld
then
because
of
the
voice
of
the
great
words
which
the
horn
spake:
I
beheld
even
till
the
beast
was
slain,
and
his
body
destroyed,
and
given
to
the
burning
flame.
007:012
As
concerning
the
rest
of
the
beasts,
they
had
their
dominion
taken
away:
yet
their
lives
were
prolonged
for
a
season
and
time.
007:013
I
saw
in
the
night
visions,
and,
behold,
one
like
the
Son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
heaven,
and
came
to
the
Ancient
of
days,
and
they
brought
him
near
before
him.
007:014
And
there
was
given
him
dominion,
and
glory,
and
a
kingdom,
that
all
people,
nations,
and
languages,
should
serve
him:
his
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion,
which
shall
not
pass
away,
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed.
007:015
I
Daniel
was
grieved
in
my
spirit
in
the
midst
of
my
body,
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
me.
007:016
I
came
near
unto
one
of
them
that
stood
by,
and
asked
him
the
truth
of
all
this.
So
he
told
me,
and
made
me
know
the
interpretation
of
the
things.
007:017
These
great
beasts,
which
are
four,
are
four
kings,
which
shall
arise
out
of
the
earth.
007:018
But
the
saints
of
the
most
High
shall
take
the
kingdom,
and
possess
the
kingdom
for
ever,
even
for
ever
and
ever.
007:019
Then
I
would
know
the
truth
of
the
fourth
beast,
which
was
diverse
from
all
the
others,
exceeding
dreadful,
whose
teeth
were
of
iron,
and
his
nails
of
brass;
which
devoured,
brake
in
pieces,
and
stamped
the
residue
with
his
feet;
007:020
And
of
the
ten
horns
that
were
in
his
head,
and
of
the
other
which
came
up,
and
before
whom
three
fell;
even
of
that
horn
that
had
eyes,
and
a
mouth
that
spake
very
great
things,
whose
look
was
more
stout
than
his
fellows.
007:021
I
beheld,
and
the
same
horn
made
war
with
the
saints,
and
prevailed
against
them;
007:022
Until
the
Ancient
of
days
came,
and
judgment
was
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
High;
and
the
time
came
that
the
saints
possessed
the
kingdom.
007:023
Thus
he
said,
The
fourth
beast
shall
be
the
fourth
kingdom
upon
earth,
which
shall
be
diverse
from
all
kingdoms,
and
shall
devour
the
whole
earth,
and
shall
tread
it
down,
and
break
it
in
pieces.
007:024
And
the
ten
horns
out
of
this
kingdom
are
ten
kings
that
shall
arise:
and
another
shall
rise
after
them;
and
he
shall
be
diverse
from
the
first,
and
he
shall
subdue
three
kings.
007:025
And
he
shall
speak
great
words
against
the
most
High,
and
shall
wear
out
the
saints
of
the
most
High,
and
think
to
change
times
and
laws:
and
they
shall
be
given
into
his
hand
until
a
time
and
times
and
the
dividing
of
time.
007:026
But
the
judgment
shall
sit,
and
they
shall
take
away
his
dominion,
to
consume
and
to
destroy
it
unto
the
end.
007:027
And
the
kingdom
and
dominion,
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
heaven,
shall
be
given
to
the
people
of
the
saints
of
the
most
High,
whose
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom,
and
all
dominions
shall
serve
and
obey
him.
007:028
Hitherto
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
As
for
me
Daniel,
my
cogitations
much
troubled
me,
and
my
countenance
changed
in
me:
but
I
kept
the
matter
in
my
heart.
008:001
In
the
third
year
of
the
reign
of
king
Belshazzar
a
vision
appeared
unto
me,
even
unto
me
Daniel,
after
that
which
appeared
unto
me
at
the
first.
008:002
And
I
saw
in
a
vision;
and
it
came
to
pass,
when
I
saw,
that
I
was
at
Shushan
in
the
palace,
which
is
in
the
province
of
Elam;
and
I
saw
in
a
vision,
and
I
was
by
the
river
of
Ulai.
008:003
Then
I
lifted
up
mine
eyes,
and
saw,
and,
behold,
there
stood
before
the
river
a
ram
which
had
two
horns:
and
the
two
horns
were
high;
but
one
was
higher
than
the
other,
and
the
higher
came
up
last.
008:004
I
saw
the
ram
pushing
westward,
and
northward,
and
southward;
so
that
no
beasts
might
stand
before
him,
neither
was
there
any
that
could
deliver
out
of
his
hand;
but
he
did
according
to
his
will,
and
became
great.
008:005
And
as
I
was
considering,
behold,
an
he
goat
came
from
the
west
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth,
and
touched
not
the
ground:
and
the
goat
had
a
notable
horn
between
his
eyes.
008:006
And
he
came
to
the
ram
that
had
two
horns,
which
I
had
seen
standing
before
the
river,
and
ran
unto
him
in
the
fury
of
his
power.
008:007
And
I
saw
him
come
close
unto
the
ram,
and
he
was
moved
with
choler
against
him,
and
smote
the
ram,
and
brake
his
two
horns:
and
there
was
no
power
in
the
ram
to
stand
before
him,
but
he
cast
him
down
to
the
ground,
and
stamped
upon
him:
and
there
was
none
that
could
deliver
the
ram
out
of
his
hand.
008:008
Therefore
the
he
goat
waxed
very
great:
and
when
he
was
strong,
the
great
horn
was
broken;
and
for
it
came
up
four
notable
ones
toward
the
four
winds
of
heaven.
008:009
And
out
of
one
of
them
came
forth
a
little
horn,
which
waxed
exceeding
great,
toward
the
south,
and
toward
the
east,
and
toward
the
pleasant
land.
008:010
And
it
waxed
great,
even
to
the
host
of
heaven;
and
it
cast
down
some
of
the
host
and
of
the
stars
to
the
ground,
and
stamped
upon
them.
008:011
Yea,
he
magnified
himself
even
to
the
prince
of
the
host,
and
by
him
the
daily
sacrifice
was
taken
away,
and
the
place
of
the
sanctuary
was
cast
down.
008:012
And
an
host
was
given
him
against
the
daily
sacrifice
by
reason
of
transgression,
and
it
cast
down
the
truth
to
the
ground;
and
it
practised,
and
prospered.
008:013
Then
I
heard
one
saint
speaking,
and
another
saint
said
unto
that
certain
saint
which
spake,
How
long
shall
be
the
vision
concerning
the
daily
sacrifice,
and
the
transgression
of
desolation,
to
give
both
the
sanctuary
and
the
host
to
be
trodden
under
foot?
008:014
And
he
said
unto
me,
Unto
two
thousand
and
three
hundred
days;
then
shall
the
sanctuary
be
cleansed.
008:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
I,
even
I
Daniel,
had
seen
the
vision,
and
sought
for
the
meaning,
then,
behold,
there
stood
before
me
as
the
appearance
of
a
man.
008:016
And
I
heard
a
man's
voice
between
the
banks
of
Ulai,
which
called,
and
said,
Gabriel,
make
this
man
to
understand
the
vision.
008:017
So
he
came
near
where
I
stood:
and
when
he
came,
I
was
afraid,
and
fell
upon
my
face:
but
he
said
unto
me,
Understand,
O
son
of
man:
for
at
the
time
of
the
end
shall
be
the
vision.
008:018
Now
as
he
was
speaking
with
me,
I
was
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
face
toward
the
ground:
but
he
touched
me,
and
set
me
upright.
008:019
And
he
said,
Behold,
I
will
make
thee
know
what
shall
be
in
the
last
end
of
the
indignation:
for
at
the
time
appointed
the
end
shall
be.
008:020
The
ram
which
thou
sawest
having
two
horns
are
the
kings
of
Media
and
Persia.
008:021
And
the
rough
goat
is
the
king
of
Grecia:
and
the
great
horn
that
is
between
his
eyes
is
the
first
king.
008:022
Now
that
being
broken,
whereas
four
stood
up
for
it,
four
kingdoms
shall
stand
up
out
of
the
nation,
but
not
in
his
power.
008:023
And
in
the
latter
time
of
their
kingdom,
when
the
transgressors
are
come
to
the
full,
a
king
of
fierce
countenance,
and
understanding
dark
sentences,
shall
stand
up.
008:024
And
his
power
shall
be
mighty,
but
not
by
his
own
power:
and
he
shall
destroy
wonderfully,
and
shall
prosper,
and
practise,
and
shall
destroy
the
mighty
and
the
holy
people.
008:025
And
through
his
policy
also
he
shall
cause
craft
to
prosper
in
his
hand;
and
he
shall
magnify
himself
in
his
heart,
and
by
peace
shall
destroy
many:
he
shall
also
stand
up
against
the
Prince
of
princes;
but
he
shall
be
broken
without
hand.
008:026
And
the
vision
of
the
evening
and
the
morning
which
was
told
is
true:
wherefore
shut
thou
up
the
vision;
for
it
shall
be
for
many
days.
008:027
And
I
Daniel
fainted,
and
was
sick
certain
days;
afterward
I
rose
up,
and
did
the
king's
business;
and
I
was
astonished
at
the
vision,
but
none
understood
it.
009:001
In
the
first
year
of
Darius
the
son
of
Ahasuerus,
of
the
seed
of
the
Medes,
which
was
made
king
over
the
realm
of
the
Chaldeans;
009:002
In
the
first
year
of
his
reign
I
Daniel
understood
by
books
the
number
of
the
years,
whereof
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet,
that
he
would
accomplish
seventy
years
in
the
desolations
of
Jerusalem.
009:003
And
I
set
my
face
unto
the
Lord
God,
to
seek
by
prayer
and
supplications,
with
fasting,
and
sackcloth,
and
ashes:
009:004
And
I
prayed
unto
the
LORD
my
God,
and
made
my
confession,
and
said,
O
Lord,
the
great
and
dreadful
God,
keeping
the
covenant
and
mercy
to
them
that
love
him,
and
to
them
that
keep
his
commandments;
009:005
We
have
sinned,
and
have
committed
iniquity,
and
have
done
wickedly,
and
have
rebelled,
even
by
departing
from
thy
precepts
and
from
thy
judgments:
009:006
Neither
have
we
hearkened
unto
thy
servants
the
prophets,
which
spake
in
thy
name
to
our
kings,
our
princes,
and
our
fathers,
and
to
all
the
people
of
the
land.
009:007
O
LORD,
righteousness
belongeth
unto
thee,
but
unto
us
confusion
of
faces,
as
at
this
day;
to
the
men
of
Judah,
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
and
unto
all
Israel,
that
are
near,
and
that
are
far
off,
through
all
the
countries
whither
thou
hast
driven
them,
because
of
their
trespass
that
they
have
trespassed
against
thee.
009:008
O
Lord,
to
us
belongeth
confusion
of
face,
to
our
kings,
to
our
princes,
and
to
our
fathers,
because
we
have
sinned
against
thee.
009:009
To
the
Lord
our
God
belong
mercies
and
forgivenesses,
though
we
have
rebelled
against
him;
009:010
Neither
have
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
LORD
our
God,
to
walk
in
his
laws,
which
he
set
before
us
by
his
servants
the
prophets.
009:011
Yea,
all
Israel
have
transgressed
thy
law,
even
by
departing,
that
they
might
not
obey
thy
voice;
therefore
the
curse
is
poured
upon
us,
and
the
oath
that
is
written
in
the
law
of
Moses
the
servant
of
God,
because
we
have
sinned
against
him.
009:012
And
he
hath
confirmed
his
words,
