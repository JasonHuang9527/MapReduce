which
he
spake
against
us,
and
against
our
judges
that
judged
us,
by
bringing
upon
us
a
great
evil:
for
under
the
whole
heaven
hath
not
been
done
as
hath
been
done
upon
Jerusalem.
009:013
As
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
Moses,
all
this
evil
is
come
upon
us:
yet
made
we
not
our
prayer
before
the
LORD
our
God,
that
we
might
turn
from
our
iniquities,
and
understand
thy
truth.
009:014
Therefore
hath
the
LORD
watched
upon
the
evil,
and
brought
it
upon
us:
for
the
LORD
our
God
is
righteous
in
all
his
works
which
he
doeth:
for
we
obeyed
not
his
voice.
009:015
And
now,
O
Lord
our
God,
that
hast
brought
thy
people
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
hand,
and
hast
gotten
thee
renown,
as
at
this
day;
we
have
sinned,
we
have
done
wickedly.
009:016
O
LORD,
according
to
all
thy
righteousness,
I
beseech
thee,
let
thine
anger
and
thy
fury
be
turned
away
from
thy
city
Jerusalem,
thy
holy
mountain:
because
for
our
sins,
and
for
the
iniquities
of
our
fathers,
Jerusalem
and
thy
people
are
become
a
reproach
to
all
that
are
about
us.
009:017
Now
therefore,
O
our
God,
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
servant,
and
his
supplications,
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
sanctuary
that
is
desolate,
for
the
Lord's
sake.
009:018
O
my
God,
incline
thine
ear,
and
hear;
open
thine
eyes,
and
behold
our
desolations,
and
the
city
which
is
called
by
thy
name:
for
we
do
not
present
our
supplications
before
thee
for
our
righteousnesses,
but
for
thy
great
mercies.
009:019
O
Lord,
hear;
O
Lord,
forgive;
O
Lord,
hearken
and
do;
defer
not,
for
thine
own
sake,
O
my
God:
for
thy
city
and
thy
people
are
called
by
thy
name.
009:020
And
whiles
I
was
speaking,
and
praying,
and
confessing
my
sin
and
the
sin
of
my
people
Israel,
and
presenting
my
supplication
before
the
LORD
my
God
for
the
holy
mountain
of
my
God;
009:021
Yea,
whiles
I
was
speaking
in
prayer,
even
the
man
Gabriel,
whom
I
had
seen
in
the
vision
at
the
beginning,
being
caused
to
fly
swiftly,
touched
me
about
the
time
of
the
evening
oblation.
009:022
And
he
informed
me,
and
talked
with
me,
and
said,
O
Daniel,
I
am
now
come
forth
to
give
thee
skill
and
understanding.
009:023
At
the
beginning
of
thy
supplications
the
commandment
came
forth,
and
I
am
come
to
shew
thee;
for
thou
art
greatly
beloved:
therefore
understand
the
matter,
and
consider
the
vision.
009:024
Seventy
weeks
are
determined
upon
thy
people
and
upon
thy
holy
city,
to
finish
the
transgression,
and
to
make
an
end
of
sins,
and
to
make
reconciliation
for
iniquity,
and
to
bring
in
everlasting
righteousness,
and
to
seal
up
the
vision
and
prophecy,
and
to
anoint
the
most
Holy.
009:025
Know
therefore
and
understand,
that
from
the
going
forth
of
the
commandment
to
restore
and
to
build
Jerusalem
unto
the
Messiah
the
Prince
shall
be
seven
weeks,
and
threescore
and
two
weeks:
the
street
shall
be
built
again,
and
the
wall,
even
in
troublous
times.
009:026
And
after
threescore
and
two
weeks
shall
Messiah
be
cut
off,
but
not
for
himself:
and
the
people
of
the
prince
that
shall
come
shall
destroy
the
city
and
the
sanctuary;
and
the
end
thereof
shall
be
with
a
flood,
and
unto
the
end
of
the
war
desolations
are
determined.
009:027
And
he
shall
confirm
the
covenant
with
many
for
one
week:
and
in
the
midst
of
the
week
he
shall
cause
the
sacrifice
and
the
oblation
to
cease,
and
for
the
overspreading
of
abominations
he
shall
make
it
desolate,
even
until
the
consummation,
and
that
determined
shall
be
poured
upon
the
desolate.
010:001
In
the
third
year
of
Cyrus
king
of
Persia
a
thing
was
revealed
unto
Daniel,
whose
name
was
called
Belteshazzar;
and
the
thing
was
true,
but
the
time
appointed
was
long:
and
he
understood
the
thing,
and
had
understanding
of
the
vision.
010:002
In
those
days
I
Daniel
was
mourning
three
full
weeks.
010:003
I
ate
no
pleasant
bread,
neither
came
flesh
nor
wine
in
my
mouth,
neither
did
I
anoint
myself
at
all,
till
three
whole
weeks
were
fulfilled.
010:004
And
in
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
first
month,
as
I
was
by
the
side
of
the
great
river,
which
is
Hiddekel;
010:005
Then
I
lifted
up
mine
eyes,
and
looked,
and
behold
a
certain
man
clothed
in
linen,
whose
loins
were
girded
with
fine
gold
of
Uphaz:
010:006
His
body
also
was
like
the
beryl,
and
his
face
as
the
appearance
of
lightning,
and
his
eyes
as
lamps
of
fire,
and
his
arms
and
his
feet
like
in
colour
to
polished
brass,
and
the
voice
of
his
words
like
the
voice
of
a
multitude.
010:007
And
I
Daniel
alone
saw
the
vision:
for
the
men
that
were
with
me
saw
not
the
vision;
but
a
great
quaking
fell
upon
them,
so
that
they
fled
to
hide
themselves.
010:008
Therefore
I
was
left
alone,
and
saw
this
great
vision,
and
there
remained
no
strength
in
me:
for
my
comeliness
was
turned
in
me
into
corruption,
and
I
retained
no
strength.
010:009
Yet
heard
I
the
voice
of
his
words:
and
when
I
heard
the
voice
of
his
words,
then
was
I
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
face,
and
my
face
toward
the
ground.
010:010
And,
behold,
an
hand
touched
me,
which
set
me
upon
my
knees
and
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands.
010:011
And
he
said
unto
me,
O
Daniel,
a
man
greatly
beloved,
understand
the
words
that
I
speak
unto
thee,
and
stand
upright:
for
unto
thee
am
I
now
sent.
And
when
he
had
spoken
this
word
unto
me,
I
stood
trembling.
010:012
Then
said
he
unto
me,
Fear
not,
Daniel:
for
from
the
first
day
that
thou
didst
set
thine
heart
to
understand,
and
to
chasten
thyself
before
thy
God,
thy
words
were
heard,
and
I
am
come
for
thy
words.
010:013
But
the
prince
of
the
kingdom
of
Persia
withstood
me
one
and
twenty
days:
but,
lo,
Michael,
one
of
the
chief
princes,
came
to
help
me;
and
I
remained
there
with
the
kings
of
Persia.
010:014
Now
I
am
come
to
make
thee
understand
what
shall
befall
thy
people
in
the
latter
days:
for
yet
the
vision
is
for
many
days.
010:015
And
when
he
had
spoken
such
words
unto
me,
I
set
my
face
toward
the
ground,
and
I
became
dumb.
010:016
And,
behold,
one
like
the
similitude
of
the
sons
of
men
touched
my
lips:
then
I
opened
my
mouth,
and
spake,
and
said
unto
him
that
stood
before
me,
O
my
lord,
by
the
vision
my
sorrows
are
turned
upon
me,
and
I
have
retained
no
strength.
010:017
For
how
can
the
servant
of
this
my
lord
talk
with
this
my
lord?
for
as
for
me,
straightway
there
remained
no
strength
in
me,
neither
is
there
breath
left
in
me.
010:018
Then
there
came
again
and
touched
me
one
like
the
appearance
of
a
man,
and
he
strengthened
me,
010:019
And
said,
O
man
greatly
beloved,
fear
not:
peace
be
unto
thee,
be
strong,
yea,
be
strong.
And
when
he
had
spoken
unto
me,
I
was
strengthened,
and
said,
Let
my
lord
speak;
for
thou
hast
strengthened
me.
010:020
Then
said
he,
Knowest
thou
wherefore
I
come
unto
thee?
and
now
will
I
return
to
fight
with
the
prince
of
Persia:
and
when
I
am
gone
forth,
lo,
the
prince
of
Grecia
shall
come.
010:021
But
I
will
shew
thee
that
which
is
noted
in
the
scripture
of
truth:
and
there
is
none
that
holdeth
with
me
in
these
things,
but
Michael
your
prince.
011:001
Also
I
in
the
first
year
of
Darius
the
Mede,
even
I,
stood
to
confirm
and
to
strengthen
him.
011:002
And
now
will
I
shew
thee
the
truth.
Behold,
there
shall
stand
up
yet
three
kings
in
Persia;
and
the
fourth
shall
be
far
richer
than
they
all:
and
by
his
strength
through
his
riches
he
shall
stir
up
all
against
the
realm
of
Grecia.
011:003
And
a
mighty
king
shall
stand
up,
that
shall
rule
with
great
dominion,
and
do
according
to
his
will.
011:004
And
when
he
shall
stand
up,
his
kingdom
shall
be
broken,
and
shall
be
divided
toward
the
four
winds
of
heaven;
and
not
to
his
posterity,
nor
according
to
his
dominion
which
he
ruled:
for
his
kingdom
shall
be
plucked
up,
even
for
others
beside
those.
011:005
And
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
strong,
and
one
of
his
princes;
and
he
shall
be
strong
above
him,
and
have
dominion;
his
dominion
shall
be
a
great
dominion.
011:006
And
in
the
end
of
years
they
shall
join
themselves
together;
for
the
king's
daughter
of
the
south
shall
come
to
the
king
of
the
north
to
make
an
agreement:
but
she
shall
not
retain
the
power
of
the
arm;
neither
shall
he
stand,
nor
his
arm:
but
she
shall
be
given
up,
and
they
that
brought
her,
and
he
that
begat
her,
and
he
that
strengthened
her
in
these
times.
011:007
But
out
of
a
branch
of
her
roots
shall
one
stand
up
in
his
estate,
which
shall
come
with
an
army,
and
shall
enter
into
the
fortress
of
the
king
of
the
north,
and
shall
deal
against
them,
and
shall
prevail:
011:008
And
shall
also
carry
captives
into
Egypt
their
gods,
with
their
princes,
and
with
their
precious
vessels
of
silver
and
of
gold;
and
he
shall
continue
more
years
than
the
king
of
the
north.
011:009
So
the
king
of
the
south
shall
come
into
his
kingdom,
and
shall
return
into
his
own
land.
011:010
But
his
sons
shall
be
stirred
up,
and
shall
assemble
a
multitude
of
great
forces:
and
one
shall
certainly
come,
and
overflow,
and
pass
through:
then
shall
he
return,
and
be
stirred
up,
even
to
his
fortress.
011:011
And
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
moved
with
choler,
and
shall
come
forth
and
fight
with
him,
even
with
the
king
of
the
north:
and
he
shall
set
forth
a
great
multitude;
but
the
multitude
shall
be
given
into
his
hand.
011:012
And
when
he
hath
taken
away
the
multitude,
his
heart
shall
be
lifted
up;
and
he
shall
cast
down
many
ten
thousands:
but
he
shall
not
be
strengthened
by
it.
011:013
For
the
king
of
the
north
shall
return,
and
shall
set
forth
a
multitude
greater
than
the
former,
and
shall
certainly
come
after
certain
years
with
a
great
army
and
with
much
riches.
011:014
And
in
those
times
there
shall
many
stand
up
against
the
king
of
the
south:
also
the
robbers
of
thy
people
shall
exalt
themselves
to
establish
the
vision;
but
they
shall
fall.
011:015
So
the
king
of
the
north
shall
come,
and
cast
up
a
mount,
and
take
the
most
fenced
cities:
and
the
arms
of
the
south
shall
not
withstand,
neither
his
chosen
people,
neither
shall
there
be
any
strength
to
withstand.
011:016
But
he
that
cometh
against
him
shall
do
according
to
his
own
will,
and
none
shall
stand
before
him:
and
he
shall
stand
in
the
glorious
land,
which
by
his
hand
shall
be
consumed.
011:017
He
shall
also
set
his
face
to
enter
with
the
strength
of
his
whole
kingdom,
and
upright
ones
with
him;
thus
shall
he
do:
and
he
shall
give
him
the
daughter
of
women,
corrupting
her:
but
she
shall
not
stand
on
his
side,
neither
be
for
him.
011:018
After
this
shall
he
turn
his
face
unto
the
isles,
and
shall
take
many:
but
a
prince
for
his
own
behalf
shall
cause
the
reproach
offered
by
him
to
cease;
without
his
own
reproach
he
shall
cause
it
to
turn
upon
him.
011:019
Then
he
shall
turn
his
face
toward
the
fort
of
his
own
land:
but
he
shall
stumble
and
fall,
and
not
be
found.
011:020
Then
shall
stand
up
in
his
estate
a
raiser
of
taxes
in
the
glory
of
the
kingdom:
but
within
few
days
he
shall
be
destroyed,
neither
in
anger,
nor
in
battle.
011:021
And
in
his
estate
shall
stand
up
a
vile
person,
to
whom
they
shall
not
give
the
honour
of
the
kingdom:
but
he
shall
come
in
peaceably,
and
obtain
the
kingdom
by
flatteries.
011:022
And
with
the
arms
of
a
flood
shall
they
be
overflown
from
before
him,
and
shall
be
broken;
yea,
also
the
prince
of
the
covenant.
011:023
And
after
the
league
made
with
him
he
shall
work
deceitfully:
for
he
shall
come
up,
and
shall
become
strong
with
a
small
people.
011:024
He
shall
enter
peaceably
even
upon
the
fattest
places
of
the
province;
and
he
shall
do
that
which
his
fathers
have
not
done,
nor
his
fathers'
fathers;
he
shall
scatter
among
them
the
prey,
and
spoil,
and
riches:
yea,
and
he
shall
forecast
his
devices
against
the
strong
holds,
even
for
a
time.
011:025
And
he
shall
stir
up
his
power
and
his
courage
against
the
king
of
the
south
with
a
great
army;
and
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
stirred
up
to
battle
with
a
very
great
and
mighty
army;
but
he
shall
not
stand:
for
they
shall
forecast
devices
against
him.
011:026
Yea,
they
that
feed
of
the
portion
of
his
meat
shall
destroy
him,
and
his
army
shall
overflow:
and
many
shall
fall
down
slain.
011:027
And
both
of
these
kings'
hearts
shall
be
to
do
mischief,
and
they
shall
speak
lies
at
one
table;
but
it
shall
not
prosper:
for
yet
the
end
shall
be
at
the
time
appointed.
011:028
Then
shall
he
return
into
his
land
with
great
riches;
and
his
heart
shall
be
against
the
holy
covenant;
and
he
shall
do
exploits,
and
return
to
his
own
land.
011:029
At
the
time
appointed
he
shall
return,
and
come
toward
the
south;
but
it
shall
not
be
as
the
former,
or
as
the
latter.
011:030
For
the
ships
of
Chittim
shall
come
against
him:
therefore
he
shall
be
grieved,
and
return,
and
have
indignation
against
the
holy
covenant:
so
shall
he
do;
he
shall
even
return,
and
have
intelligence
with
them
that
forsake
the
holy
covenant.
011:031
And
arms
shall
stand
on
his
part,
and
they
shall
pollute
the
sanctuary
of
strength,
and
shall
take
away
the
daily
sacrifice,
and
they
shall
place
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate.
011:032
And
such
as
do
wickedly
against
the
covenant
shall
he
corrupt
by
flatteries:
but
the
people
that
do
know
their
God
shall
be
strong,
and
do
exploits.
011:033
And
they
that
understand
among
the
people
shall
instruct
many:
yet
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword,
and
by
flame,
by
captivity,
and
by
spoil,
many
days.
011:034
Now
when
they
shall
fall,
they
shall
be
holpen
with
a
little
help:
but
many
shall
cleave
to
them
with
flatteries.
011:035
And
some
of
them
of
understanding
shall
fall,
to
try
them,
and
to
purge,
and
to
make
them
white,
even
to
the
time
of
the
end:
because
it
is
yet
for
a
time
appointed.
011:036
And
the
king
shall
do
according
to
his
will;
and
he
shall
exalt
himself,
and
magnify
himself
above
every
god,
and
shall
speak
marvellous
things
against
the
God
of
gods,
and
shall
prosper
till
the
indignation
be
accomplished:
for
that
that
is
determined
shall
be
done.
011:037
Neither
shall
he
regard
the
God
of
his
fathers,
nor
the
desire
of
women,
nor
regard
any
god:
for
he
shall
magnify
himself
above
all.
011:038
But
in
his
estate
shall
he
honour
the
God
of
forces:
and
a
god
whom
his
fathers
knew
not
shall
he
honour
with
gold,
and
silver,
and
with
precious
stones,
and
pleasant
things.
011:039
Thus
shall
he
do
in
the
most
strong
holds
with
a
strange
god,
whom
he
shall
acknowledge
and
increase
with
glory:
and
he
shall
cause
them
to
rule
over
many,
and
shall
divide
the
land
for
gain.
011:040
And
at
the
time
of
the
end
shall
the
king
of
the
south
push
at
him:
and
the
king
of
the
north
shall
come
against
him
like
a
whirlwind,
with
chariots,
and
with
horsemen,
and
with
many
ships;
and
he
shall
enter
into
the
countries,
and
shall
overflow
and
pass
over.
011:041
He
shall
enter
also
into
the
glorious
land,
and
many
countries
shall
be
overthrown:
but
these
shall
escape
out
of
his
hand,
even
Edom,
and
Moab,
and
the
chief
of
the
children
of
Ammon.
011:042
He
shall
stretch
forth
his
hand
also
upon
the
countries:
and
the
land
of
Egypt
shall
not
escape.
011:043
But
he
shall
have
power
over
the
treasures
of
gold
and
of
silver,
and
over
all
the
precious
things
of
Egypt:
and
the
Libyans
and
the
Ethiopians
shall
be
at
his
steps.
011:044
But
tidings
out
of
the
east
and
out
of
the
north
shall
trouble
him:
therefore
he
shall
go
forth
with
great
fury
to
destroy,
and
utterly
to
make
away
many.
011:045
And
he
shall
plant
the
tabernacles
of
his
palace
between
the
seas
in
the
glorious
holy
mountain;
yet
he
shall
come
to
his
end,
and
none
shall
help
him.
012:001
And
at
that
time
shall
Michael
stand
up,
the
great
prince
which
standeth
for
the
children
of
thy
people:
and
there
shall
be
a
time
of
trouble,
such
as
never
was
since
there
was
a
nation
even
to
that
same
time:
and
at
that
time
thy
people
shall
be
delivered,
every
one
that
shall
be
found
written
in
the
book.
012:002
And
many
of
them
that
sleep
in
the
dust
of
the
earth
shall
awake,
some
to
everlasting
life,
and
some
to
shame
and
everlasting
contempt.
012:003
And
they
that
be
wise
shall
shine
as
the
brightness
of
the
firmament;
and
they
that
turn
many
to
righteousness
as
the
stars
for
ever
and
ever.
012:004
But
thou,
O
Daniel,
shut
up
the
words,
and
seal
the
book,
even
to
the
time
of
the
end:
many
shall
run
to
and
fro,
and
knowledge
shall
be
increased.
012:005
Then
I
Daniel
looked,
and,
behold,
there
stood
other
two,
the
one
on
this
side
of
the
bank
of
the
river,
and
the
other
on
that
side
of
the
bank
of
the
river.
012:006
And
one
said
to
the
man
clothed
in
linen,
which
was
upon
the
waters
of
the
river,
How
long
shall
it
be
to
the
end
of
these
wonders?
012:007
And
I
heard
the
man
clothed
in
linen,
which
was
upon
the
waters
of
the
river,
when
he
held
up
his
right
hand
and
his
left
hand
unto
heaven,
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
that
it
shall
be
for
a
time,
times,
and
an
half;
and
when
he
shall
have
accomplished
to
scatter
the
power
of
the
holy
people,
all
these
things
shall
be
finished.
012:008
And
I
heard,
but
I
understood
not:
then
said
I,
O
my
Lord,
what
shall
be
the
end
of
these
things?
012:009
And
he
said,
Go
thy
way,
Daniel:
for
the
words
are
closed
up
and
sealed
till
the
time
of
the
end.
012:010
Many
shall
be
purified,
and
made
white,
and
tried;
but
the
wicked
shall
do
wickedly:
and
none
of
the
wicked
shall
understand;
but
the
wise
shall
understand.
012:011
And
from
the
time
that
the
daily
sacrifice
shall
be
taken
away,
and
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate
set
up,
there
shall
be
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
ninety
days.
012:012
Blessed
is
he
that
waiteth,
and
cometh
to
the
thousand
three
hundred
and
five
and
thirty
days.
012:013
But
go
thou
thy
way
till
the
end
be:
for
thou
shalt
rest,
and
stand
in
thy
lot
at
the
end
of
the
days.
Book
28	Hosea
001:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
that
came
unto
Hosea,
the
son
of
Beeri,
in
the
days
of
Uzziah,
Jotham,
Ahaz,
and
Hezekiah,
kings
of
Judah,
and
in
the
days
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Joash,
king
of
Israel.
001:002
The
beginning
of
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
Hosea.
And
the
LORD
said
to
Hosea,
Go,
take
unto
thee
a
wife
of
whoredoms
and
children
of
whoredoms:
for
the
land
hath
committed
great
whoredom,
departing
from
the
LORD.
001:003
So
he
went
and
took
Gomer
the
daughter
of
Diblaim;
which
conceived,
and
bare
him
a
son.
001:004
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Call
his
name
Jezreel;
for
yet
a
little
while,
and
I
will
avenge
the
blood
of
Jezreel
upon
the
house
of
Jehu,
and
will
cause
to
cease
the
kingdom
of
the
house
of
Israel.
001:005
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
at
that
day,
that
I
will
break
the
bow
of
Israel,
in
the
valley
of
Jezreel.
001:006
And
she
conceived
again,
and
bare
a
daughter.
And
God
said
unto
him,
Call
her
name
Loruhamah:
for
I
will
no
more
have
mercy
upon
the
house
of
Israel;
but
I
will
utterly
take
them
away.
001:007
But
I
will
have
mercy
upon
the
house
of
Judah,
and
will
save
them
by
the
LORD
their
God,
and
will
not
save
them
by
bow,
nor
by
sword,
nor
by
battle,
by
horses,
nor
by
horsemen.
001:008
Now
when
she
had
weaned
Loruhamah,
she
conceived,
and
bare
a
son.
001:009
Then
said
God,
Call
his
name
Loammi:
for
ye
are
not
my
people,
and
I
will
not
be
your
God.
001:010
Yet
the
number
of
the
children
of
Israel
shall
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea,
which
cannot
be
measured
nor
numbered;
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
in
the
place
where
it
was
said
unto
them,
Ye
are
not
my
people,
there
it
shall
be
said
unto
them,
Ye
are
the
sons
of
the
living
God.
001:011
Then
shall
the
children
of
Judah
and
the
children
of
Israel
be
gathered
together,
and
appoint
themselves
one
head,
and
they
shall
come
up
out
of
the
land:
for
great
shall
be
the
day
of
Jezreel.
002:001
Say
ye
unto
your
brethren,
Ammi;
and
to
your
sisters,
Ruhamah.
002:002
Plead
with
your
mother,
plead:
for
she
is
not
my
wife,
neither
am
I
her
husband:
let
her
therefore
put
away
her
whoredoms
out
of
her
sight,
and
her
adulteries
from
between
her
breasts;
002:003
Lest
I
strip
her
naked,
and
set
her
as
in
the
day
that
she
was
born,
and
make
her
as
a
wilderness,
and
set
her
like
a
dry
land,
and
slay
her
with
thirst.
002:004
And
I
will
not
have
mercy
upon
her
children;
for
they
be
the
children
of
whoredoms.
002:005
For
their
mother
hath
played
the
harlot:
she
that
conceived
them
hath
done
shamefully:
for
she
said,
I
will
go
after
my
lovers,
that
give
me
my
bread
and
my
water,
my
wool
and
my
flax,
mine
oil
and
my
drink.
002:006
Therefore,
behold,
I
will
hedge
up
thy
way
with
thorns,
and
make
a
wall,
that
she
shall
not
find
her
paths.
002:007
And
she
shall
follow
after
her
lovers,
but
she
shall
not
overtake
them;
and
she
shall
seek
them,
but
shall
not
find
them:
then
shall
she
say,
I
will
go
and
return
to
my
first
husband;
for
then
was
it
better
with
me
than
now.
002:008
For
she
did
not
know
that
I
gave
her
corn,
and
wine,
and
oil,
and
multiplied
her
silver
and
gold,
which
they
prepared
for
Baal.
002:009
Therefore
will
I
return,
and
take
away
my
corn
in
the
time
thereof,
and
my
wine
in
the
season
thereof,
and
will
recover
my
wool
and
my
flax
given
to
cover
her
nakedness.
002:010
And
now
will
I
discover
her
lewdness
in
the
sight
of
her
lovers,
and
none
shall
deliver
her
out
of
mine
hand.
002:011
I
will
also
cause
all
her
mirth
to
cease,
her
feast
days,
her
new
moons,
and
her
sabbaths,
and
all
her
solemn
feasts.
002:012
And
I
will
destroy
her
vines
and
her
fig
trees,
whereof
she
hath
said,
These
are
my
rewards
that
my
lovers
have
given
me:
and
I
will
make
them
a
forest,
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
eat
them.
002:013
And
I
will
visit
upon
her
the
days
of
Baalim,
wherein
she
burned
incense
to
them,
and
she
decked
herself
with
her
earrings
and
her
jewels,
and
she
went
after
her
lovers,
and
forgat
me,
saith
the
LORD.
002:014
Therefore,
behold,
I
will
allure
her,
and
bring
her
into
the
wilderness,
and
speak
comfortably
unto
her.
002:015
And
I
will
give
her
her
vineyards
from
thence,
and
the
valley
of
Achor
for
a
door
