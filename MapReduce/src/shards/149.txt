me,
saith
the
LORD.
004:007
And
also
I
have
withholden
the
rain
from
you,
when
there
were
yet
three
months
to
the
harvest:
and
I
caused
it
to
rain
upon
one
city,
and
caused
it
not
to
rain
upon
another
city:
one
piece
was
rained
upon,
and
the
piece
whereupon
it
rained
not
withered.
004:008
So
two
or
three
cities
wandered
unto
one
city,
to
drink
water;
but
they
were
not
satisfied:
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me,
saith
the
LORD.
004:009
I
have
smitten
you
with
blasting
and
mildew:
when
your
gardens
and
your
vineyards
and
your
fig
trees
and
your
olive
trees
increased,
the
palmerworm
devoured
them:
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me,
saith
the
LORD.
004:010
I
have
sent
among
you
the
pestilence
after
the
manner
of
Egypt:
your
young
men
have
I
slain
with
the
sword,
and
have
taken
away
your
horses;
and
I
have
made
the
stink
of
your
camps
to
come
up
unto
your
nostrils:
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me,
saith
the
LORD.
004:011
I
have
overthrown
some
of
you,
as
God
overthrew
Sodom
and
Gomorrah,
and
ye
were
as
a
firebrand
plucked
out
of
the
burning:
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me,
saith
the
LORD.
004:012
Therefore
thus
will
I
do
unto
thee,
O
Israel:
and
because
I
will
do
this
unto
thee,
prepare
to
meet
thy
God,
O
Israel.
004:013
For,
lo,
he
that
formeth
the
mountains,
and
createth
the
wind,
and
declareth
unto
man
what
is
his
thought,
that
maketh
the
morning
darkness,
and
treadeth
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth,
The
LORD,
The
God
of
hosts,
is
his
name.
005:001
Hear
ye
this
word
which
I
take
up
against
you,
even
a
lamentation,
O
house
of
Israel.
005:002
The
virgin
of
Israel
is
fallen;
she
shall
no
more
rise:
she
is
forsaken
upon
her
land;
there
is
none
to
raise
her
up.
005:003
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD;
The
city
that
went
out
by
a
thousand
shall
leave
an
hundred,
and
that
which
went
forth
by
an
hundred
shall
leave
ten,
to
the
house
of
Israel.
005:004
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
unto
the
house
of
Israel,
Seek
ye
me,
and
ye
shall
live:
005:005
But
seek
not
Bethel,
nor
enter
into
Gilgal,
and
pass
not
to
Beersheba:
for
Gilgal
shall
surely
go
into
captivity,
and
Bethel
shall
come
to
nought.
005:006
Seek
the
LORD,
and
ye
shall
live;
lest
he
break
out
like
fire
in
the
house
of
Joseph,
and
devour
it,
and
there
be
none
to
quench
it
in
Bethel.
005:007
Ye
who
turn
judgment
to
wormwood,
and
leave
off
righteousness
in
the
earth,
005:008
Seek
him
that
maketh
the
seven
stars
and
Orion,
and
turneth
the
shadow
of
death
into
the
morning,
and
maketh
the
day
dark
with
night:
that
calleth
for
the
waters
of
the
sea,
and
poureth
them
out
upon
the
face
of
the
earth:
The
LORD
is
his
name:
005:009
That
strengtheneth
the
spoiled
against
the
strong,
so
that
the
spoiled
shall
come
against
the
fortress.
005:010
They
hate
him
that
rebuketh
in
the
gate,
and
they
abhor
him
that
speaketh
uprightly.
005:011
Forasmuch
therefore
as
your
treading
is
upon
the
poor,
and
ye
take
from
him
burdens
of
wheat:
ye
have
built
houses
of
hewn
stone,
but
ye
shall
not
dwell
in
them;
ye
have
planted
pleasant
vineyards,
but
ye
shall
not
drink
wine
of
them.
005:012
For
I
know
your
manifold
transgressions
and
your
mighty
sins:
they
afflict
the
just,
they
take
a
bribe,
and
they
turn
aside
the
poor
in
the
gate
from
their
right.
005:013
Therefore
the
prudent
shall
keep
silence
in
that
time;
for
it
is
an
evil
time.
005:014
Seek
good,
and
not
evil,
that
ye
may
live:
and
so
the
LORD,
the
God
of
hosts,
shall
be
with
you,
as
ye
have
spoken.
005:015
Hate
the
evil,
and
love
the
good,
and
establish
judgment
in
the
gate:
it
may
be
that
the
LORD
God
of
hosts
will
be
gracious
unto
the
remnant
of
Joseph.
005:016
Therefore
the
LORD,
the
God
of
hosts,
the
LORD,
saith
thus;
Wailing
shall
be
in
all
streets;
and
they
shall
say
in
all
the
highways,
Alas!
alas!
and
they
shall
call
the
husbandman
to
mourning,
and
such
as
are
skilful
of
lamentation
to
wailing.
005:017
And
in
all
vineyards
shall
be
wailing:
for
I
will
pass
through
thee,
saith
the
LORD.
005:018
Woe
unto
you
that
desire
the
day
of
the
LORD!
to
what
end
is
it
for
you?
the
day
of
the
LORD
is
darkness,
and
not
light.
005:019
As
if
a
man
did
flee
from
a
lion,
and
a
bear
met
him;
or
went
into
the
house,
and
leaned
his
hand
on
the
wall,
and
a
serpent
bit
him.
005:020
Shall
not
the
day
of
the
LORD
be
darkness,
and
not
light?
even
very
dark,
and
no
brightness
in
it?
005:021
I
hate,
I
despise
your
feast
days,
and
I
will
not
smell
in
your
solemn
assemblies.
005:022
Though
ye
offer
me
burnt
offerings
and
your
meat
offerings,
I
will
not
accept
them:
neither
will
I
regard
the
peace
offerings
of
your
fat
beasts.
005:023
Take
thou
away
from
me
the
noise
of
thy
songs;
for
I
will
not
hear
the
melody
of
thy
viols.
005:024
But
let
judgment
run
down
as
waters,
and
righteousness
as
a
mighty
stream.
005:025
Have
ye
offered
unto
me
sacrifices
and
offerings
in
the
wilderness
forty
years,
O
house
of
Israel?
005:026
But
ye
have
borne
the
tabernacle
of
your
Moloch
and
Chiun
your
images,
the
star
of
your
god,
which
ye
made
to
yourselves.
005:027
Therefore
will
I
cause
you
to
go
into
captivity
beyond
Damascus,
saith
the
LORD,
whose
name
is
The
God
of
hosts.
006:001
Woe
to
them
that
are
at
ease
in
Zion,
and
trust
in
the
mountain
of
Samaria,
which
are
named
chief
of
the
nations,
to
whom
the
house
of
Israel
came!
006:002
Pass
ye
unto
Calneh,
and
see;
and
from
thence
go
ye
to
Hamath
the
great:
then
go
down
to
Gath
of
the
Philistines:
be
they
better
than
these
kingdoms?
or
their
border
greater
than
your
border?
006:003
Ye
that
put
far
away
the
evil
day,
and
cause
the
seat
of
violence
to
come
near;
006:004
That
lie
upon
beds
of
ivory,
and
stretch
themselves
upon
their
couches,
and
eat
the
lambs
out
of
the
flock,
and
the
calves
out
of
the
midst
of
the
stall;
006:005
That
chant
to
the
sound
of
the
viol,
and
invent
to
themselves
instruments
of
musick,
like
David;
006:006
That
drink
wine
in
bowls,
and
anoint
themselves
with
the
chief
ointments:
but
they
are
not
grieved
for
the
affliction
of
Joseph.
006:007
Therefore
now
shall
they
go
captive
with
the
first
that
go
captive,
and
the
banquet
of
them
that
stretched
themselves
shall
be
removed.
006:008
The
Lord
GOD
hath
sworn
by
himself,
saith
the
LORD
the
God
of
hosts,
I
abhor
the
excellency
of
Jacob,
and
hate
his
palaces:
therefore
will
I
deliver
up
the
city
with
all
that
is
therein.
006:009
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
there
remain
ten
men
in
one
house,
that
they
shall
die.
006:010
And
a
man's
uncle
shall
take
him
up,
and
he
that
burneth
him,
to
bring
out
the
bones
out
of
the
house,
and
shall
say
unto
him
that
is
by
the
sides
of
the
house,
Is
there
yet
any
with
thee?
and
he
shall
say,
No.
Then
shall
he
say,
Hold
thy
tongue:
for
we
may
not
make
mention
of
the
name
of
the
LORD.
006:011
For,
behold,
the
LORD
commandeth,
and
he
will
smite
the
great
house
with
breaches,
and
the
little
house
with
clefts.
006:012
Shall
horses
run
upon
the
rock?
will
one
plow
there
with
oxen?
for
ye
have
turned
judgment
into
gall,
and
the
fruit
of
righteousness
into
hemlock:
006:013
Ye
which
rejoice
in
a
thing
of
nought,
which
say,
Have
we
not
taken
to
us
horns
by
our
own
strength?
006:014
But,
behold,
I
will
raise
up
against
you
a
nation,
O
house
of
Israel,
saith
the
LORD
the
God
of
hosts;
and
they
shall
afflict
you
from
the
entering
in
of
Hemath
unto
the
river
of
the
wilderness.
007:001
Thus
hath
the
Lord
GOD
shewed
unto
me;
and,
behold,
he
formed
grasshoppers
in
the
beginning
of
the
shooting
up
of
the
latter
growth;
and,
lo,
it
was
the
latter
growth
after
the
king's
mowings.
007:002
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
eating
the
grass
of
the
land,
then
I
said,
O
Lord
GOD,
forgive,
I
beseech
thee:
by
whom
shall
Jacob
arise?
for
he
is
small.
007:003
The
LORD
repented
for
this:
It
shall
not
be,
saith
the
LORD.
007:004
Thus
hath
the
Lord
GOD
shewed
unto
me:
and,
behold,
the
Lord
GOD
called
to
contend
by
fire,
and
it
devoured
the
great
deep,
and
did
eat
up
a
part.
007:005
Then
said
I,
O
Lord
GOD,
cease,
I
beseech
thee:
by
whom
shall
Jacob
arise?
for
he
is
small.
007:006
The
LORD
repented
for
this:
This
also
shall
not
be,
saith
the
Lord
GOD.
007:007
Thus
he
shewed
me:
and,
behold,
the
LORD
stood
upon
a
wall
made
by
a
plumbline,
with
a
plumbline
in
his
hand.
007:008
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Amos,
what
seest
thou?
And
I
said,
A
plumbline.
Then
said
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
set
a
plumbline
in
the
midst
of
my
people
Israel:
I
will
not
again
pass
by
them
any
more:
007:009
And
the
high
places
of
Isaac
shall
be
desolate,
and
the
sanctuaries
of
Israel
shall
be
laid
waste;
and
I
will
rise
against
the
house
of
Jeroboam
with
the
sword.
007:010
Then
Amaziah
the
priest
of
Bethel
sent
to
Jeroboam
king
of
Israel,
saying,
Amos
hath
conspired
against
thee
in
the
midst
of
the
house
of
Israel:
the
land
is
not
able
to
bear
all
his
words.
007:011
For
thus
Amos
saith,
Jeroboam
shall
die
by
the
sword,
and
Israel
shall
surely
be
led
away
captive
out
of
their
own
land.
007:012
Also
Amaziah
said
unto
Amos,
O
thou
seer,
go,
flee
thee
away
into
the
land
of
Judah,
and
there
eat
bread,
and
prophesy
there:
007:013
But
prophesy
not
again
any
more
at
Bethel:
for
it
is
the
king's
chapel,
and
it
is
the
king's
court.
007:014
Then
answered
Amos,
and
said
to
Amaziah,
I
was
no
prophet,
neither
was
I
a
prophet's
son;
but
I
was
an
herdman,
and
a
gatherer
of
sycomore
fruit:
007:015
And
the
LORD
took
me
as
I
followed
the
flock,
and
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Go,
prophesy
unto
my
people
Israel.
007:016
Now
therefore
hear
thou
the
word
of
the
LORD:
Thou
sayest,
Prophesy
not
against
Israel,
and
drop
not
thy
word
against
the
house
of
Isaac.
007:017
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
Thy
wife
shall
be
an
harlot
in
the
city,
and
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
shall
fall
by
the
sword,
and
thy
land
shall
be
divided
by
line;
and
thou
shalt
die
in
a
polluted
land:
and
Israel
shall
surely
go
into
captivity
forth
of
his
land.
008:001
Thus
hath
the
Lord
GOD
shewed
unto
me:
and
behold
a
basket
of
summer
fruit.
008:002
And
he
said,
Amos,
what
seest
thou?
And
I
said,
A
basket
of
summer
fruit.
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
me,
The
end
is
come
upon
my
people
of
Israel;
I
will
not
again
pass
by
them
any
more.
008:003
And
the
songs
of
the
temple
shall
be
howlings
in
that
day,
saith
the
Lord
GOD:
there
shall
be
many
dead
bodies
in
every
place;
they
shall
cast
them
forth
with
silence.
008:004
Hear
this,
O
ye
that
swallow
up
the
needy,
even
to
make
the
poor
of
the
land
to
fail,
008:005
Saying,
When
will
the
new
moon
be
gone,
that
we
may
sell
corn?
and
the
sabbath,
that
we
may
set
forth
wheat,
making
the
ephah
small,
and
the
shekel
great,
and
falsifying
the
balances
by
deceit?
008:006
That
we
may
buy
the
poor
for
silver,
and
the
needy
for
a
pair
of
shoes;
yea,
and
sell
the
refuse
of
the
wheat?
008:007
The
LORD
hath
sworn
by
the
excellency
of
Jacob,
Surely
I
will
never
forget
any
of
their
works.
008:008
Shall
not
the
land
tremble
for
this,
and
every
one
mourn
that
dwelleth
therein?
and
it
shall
rise
up
wholly
as
a
flood;
and
it
shall
be
cast
out
and
drowned,
as
by
the
flood
of
Egypt.
008:009
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
that
I
will
cause
the
sun
to
go
down
at
noon,
and
I
will
darken
the
earth
in
the
clear
day:
008:010
And
I
will
turn
your
feasts
into
mourning,
and
all
your
songs
into
lamentation;
and
I
will
bring
up
sackcloth
upon
all
loins,
and
baldness
upon
every
head;
and
I
will
make
it
as
the
mourning
of
an
only
son,
and
the
end
thereof
as
a
bitter
day.
008:011
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
Lord
GOD,
that
I
will
send
a
famine
in
the
land,
not
a
famine
of
bread,
nor
a
thirst
for
water,
but
of
hearing
the
words
of
the
LORD:
008:012
And
they
shall
wander
from
sea
to
sea,
and
from
the
north
even
to
the
east,
they
shall
run
to
and
fro
to
seek
the
word
of
the
LORD,
and
shall
not
find
it.
008:013
In
that
day
shall
the
fair
virgins
and
young
men
faint
for
thirst.
008:014
They
that
swear
by
the
sin
of
Samaria,
and
say,
Thy
god,
O
Dan,
liveth;
and,
The
manner
of
Beersheba
liveth;
even
they
shall
fall,
and
never
rise
up
again.
009:001
I
saw
the
LORD
standing
upon
the
altar:
and
he
said,
Smite
the
lintel
of
the
door,
that
the
posts
may
shake:
and
cut
them
in
the
head,
all
of
them;
and
I
will
slay
the
last
of
them
with
the
sword:
he
that
fleeth
of
them
shall
not
flee
away,
and
he
that
escapeth
of
them
shall
not
be
delivered.
009:002
Though
they
dig
into
hell,
thence
shall
mine
hand
take
them;
though
they
climb
up
to
heaven,
thence
will
I
bring
them
down:
009:003
And
though
they
hide
themselves
in
the
top
of
Carmel,
I
will
search
and
take
them
out
thence;
and
though
they
be
hid
from
my
sight
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea,
thence
will
I
command
the
serpent,
and
he
shall
bite
them:
009:004
And
though
they
go
into
captivity
before
their
enemies,
thence
will
I
command
the
sword,
and
it
shall
slay
them:
and
I
will
set
mine
eyes
upon
them
for
evil,
and
not
for
good.
009:005
And
the
Lord
GOD
of
hosts
is
he
that
toucheth
the
land,
and
it
shall
melt,
and
all
that
dwell
therein
shall
mourn:
and
it
shall
rise
up
wholly
like
a
flood;
and
shall
be
drowned,
as
by
the
flood
of
Egypt.
009:006
It
is
he
that
buildeth
his
stories
in
the
heaven,
and
hath
founded
his
troop
in
the
earth;
he
that
calleth
for
the
waters
of
the
sea,
and
poureth
them
out
upon
the
face
of
the
earth:
The
LORD
is
his
name.
009:007
Are
ye
not
as
children
of
the
Ethiopians
unto
me,
O
children
of
Israel?
saith
the
LORD.
Have
not
I
brought
up
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt?
and
the
Philistines
from
Caphtor,
and
the
Syrians
from
Kir?
009:008
Behold,
the
eyes
of
the
Lord
GOD
are
upon
the
sinful
kingdom,
and
I
will
destroy
it
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth;
saving
that
I
will
not
utterly
destroy
the
house
of
Jacob,
saith
the
LORD.
009:009
For,
lo,
I
will
command,
and
I
will
sift
the
house
of
Israel
among
all
nations,
like
as
corn
is
sifted
in
a
sieve,
yet
shall
not
the
least
grain
fall
upon
the
earth.
009:010
All
the
sinners
of
my
people
shall
die
by
the
sword,
which
say,
The
evil
shall
not
overtake
nor
prevent
us.
009:011
In
that
day
will
I
raise
up
the
tabernacle
of
David
that
is
fallen,
and
close
up
the
breaches
thereof;
and
I
will
raise
up
his
ruins,
and
I
will
build
it
as
in
the
days
of
old:
009:012
That
they
may
possess
the
remnant
of
Edom,
and
of
all
the
heathen,
which
are
called
by
my
name,
saith
the
LORD
that
doeth
this.
009:013
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
LORD,
that
the
plowman
shall
overtake
the
reaper,
and
the
treader
of
grapes
him
that
soweth
seed;
and
the
mountains
shall
drop
sweet
wine,
and
all
the
hills
shall
melt.
009:014
And
I
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
my
people
of
Israel,
and
they
shall
build
the
waste
cities,
and
inhabit
them;
and
they
shall
plant
vineyards,
and
drink
the
wine
thereof;
they
shall
also
make
gardens,
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them.
009:015
And
I
will
plant
them
upon
their
land,
and
they
shall
no
more
be
pulled
up
out
of
their
land
which
I
have
given
them,
saith
the
LORD
thy
God.
Book
31	Obadiah
001:001
The
vision
of
Obadiah.
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
concerning
Edom;
We
have
heard
a
rumour
from
the
LORD,
and
an
ambassador
is
sent
among
the
heathen,
Arise
ye,
and
let
us
rise
up
against
her
in
battle.
001:002
Behold,
I
have
made
thee
small
among
the
heathen:
thou
art
greatly
despised.
001:003
The
pride
of
thine
heart
hath
deceived
thee,
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock,
whose
habitation
is
high;
that
saith
in
his
heart,
Who
shall
bring
me
down
to
the
ground?
001:004
Though
thou
exalt
thyself
as
the
eagle,
and
though
thou
set
thy
nest
among
the
stars,
thence
will
I
bring
thee
down,
saith
the
LORD.
001:005
If
thieves
came
to
thee,
if
robbers
by
night,
(how
art
thou
cut
off!)
would
they
not
have
stolen
till
they
had
enough?
if
the
grapegatherers
came
to
thee,
would
they
not
leave
some
grapes?
001:006
How
are
the
things
of
Esau
searched
out!
how
are
his
hidden
things
sought
up!
001:007
All
the
men
of
thy
confederacy
have
brought
thee
even
to
the
border:
the
men
that
were
at
peace
with
thee
have
deceived
thee,
and
prevailed
against
thee;
that
they
eat
thy
bread
have
laid
a
wound
under
thee:
there
is
none
understanding
in
him.
001:008
Shall
I
not
in
that
day,
saith
the
LORD,
even
destroy
the
wise
men
out
of
Edom,
and
understanding
out
of
the
mount
of
Esau?
001:009
And
thy
mighty
men,
O
Teman,
shall
be
dismayed,
to
the
end
that
every
one
of
the
mount
of
Esau
may
be
cut
off
by
slaughter.
001:010
For
thy
violence
against
thy
brother
Jacob
shame
shall
cover
thee,
and
thou
shalt
be
cut
off
for
ever.
001:011
In
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
on
the
other
side,
in
the
day
that
the
strangers
carried
away
captive
his
forces,
and
foreigners
entered
into
his
gates,
and
cast
lots
upon
Jerusalem,
even
thou
wast
as
one
of
them.
001:012
But
thou
shouldest
not
have
looked
on
the
day
of
thy
brother
in
the
day
that
he
became
a
stranger;
neither
shouldest
thou
have
rejoiced
over
the
children
of
Judah
in
the
day
of
their
destruction;
neither
shouldest
thou
have
spoken
proudly
in
the
day
of
distress.
001:013
Thou
shouldest
not
have
entered
into
the
gate
of
my
people
in
the
day
of
their
calamity;
yea,
thou
shouldest
not
have
looked
on
their
affliction
in
the
day
of
their
calamity,
nor
have
laid
hands
on
their
substance
in
the
day
of
their
calamity;
001:014
Neither
shouldest
thou
have
stood
in
the
crossway,
to
cut
off
those
of
his
that
did
escape;
neither
shouldest
thou
have
delivered
up
those
of
his
that
did
remain
in
the
day
of
distress.
001:015
For
the
day
of
the
LORD
is
near
upon
all
the
heathen:
as
thou
hast
done,
it
shall
be
done
unto
thee:
thy
reward
shall
return
upon
thine
own
head.
001:016
For
as
ye
have
drunk
upon
my
holy
mountain,
so
shall
all
the
heathen
drink
continually,
yea,
they
shall
drink,
and
they
shall
swallow
down,
and
they
shall
be
as
though
they
had
not
been.
001:017
But
upon
mount
Zion
shall
be
deliverance,
and
there
shall
be
holiness;
and
the
house
of
Jacob
shall
possess
their
possessions.
001:018
And
the
house
of
Jacob
shall
be
a
fire,
and
the
house
of
Joseph
a
flame,
and
the
house
of
Esau
for
stubble,
and
they
shall
kindle
in
them,
and
devour
them;
and
there
shall
not
be
any
remaining
of
the
house
of
Esau;
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken
it.
001:019
And
they
of
the
south
shall
possess
the
mount
of
Esau;
and
they
of
the
plain
the
Philistines:
and
they
shall
possess
the
fields
of
Ephraim,
and
the
fields
of
Samaria:
and
Benjamin
shall
possess
Gilead.
001:020
And
the
captivity
of
this
host
of
the
children
of
Israel
shall
possess
that
of
the
Canaanites,
even
unto
Zarephath;
and
the
captivity
of
Jerusalem,
which
is
in
Sepharad,
shall
possess
the
cities
of
the
south.
001:021
And
saviours
shall
come
up
on
mount
Zion
to
judge
the
mount
of
Esau;
and
the
kingdom
shall
be
the
LORD's.
Book
32	Jonah
001:001
Now
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Jonah
the
son
of
Amittai,
saying,
001:002
Arise,
go
to
Nineveh,
that
great
city,
and
cry
against
it;
for
their
wickedness
is
come
up
before
me.
001:003
But
Jonah
rose
up
to
flee
unto
Tarshish
from
the
presence
of
the
LORD,
and
went
down
to
Joppa;
and
he
found
a
ship
going
to
Tarshish:
so
he
paid
the
fare
thereof,
and
went
down
into
it,
to
go
with
them
unto
Tarshish
from
the
presence
of
the
LORD.
001:004
But
the
LORD
sent
out
a
great
wind
into
the
sea,
and
there
was
a
mighty
tempest
in
the
sea,
so
that
the
ship
was
like
to
be
broken.
001:005
Then
the
mariners
were
afraid,
and
cried
every
man
unto
his
god,
and
cast
forth
the
wares
that
were
in
the
ship
into
the
sea,
to
lighten
it
of
them.
But
Jonah
was
gone
down
into
the
sides
of
the
ship;
and
he
lay,
and
was
fast
asleep.
001:006
So
the
shipmaster
came
to
him,
and
said
unto
him,
What
meanest
thou,
O
sleeper?
arise,
call
upon
thy
God,
if
so
be
that
God
will
think
upon
us,
that
we
perish
not.
001:007
And
they
said
every
one
to
his
fellow,
Come,
and
let
us
cast
lots,
that
we
may
know
for
whose
cause
this
evil
is
upon
us.
So
they
cast
lots,
and
the
lot
fell
upon
Jonah.
001:008
Then
said
they
unto
him,
Tell
us,
we
pray
thee,
for
whose
cause
this
evil
is
upon
us;
What
is
thine
occupation?
and
whence
comest
thou?
what
is
thy
country?
and
of
what
people
art
thou?
001:009
And
he
said
unto
them,
I
am
an
Hebrew;
and
I
fear
the
LORD,
the
God
of
heaven,
which
hath
made
the
sea
and
the
dry
land.
001:010
Then
were
the
men
exceedingly
afraid,
and
said
unto
him.
Why
hast
thou
done
this?
For
the
men
knew
that
he
fled
from
the
presence
of
the
LORD,
because
he
had
told
them.
001:011
Then
said
they
unto
him,
What
shall
we
do
unto
thee,
that
the
sea
may
be
calm
unto
us?
for
the
sea
wrought,
and
was
tempestuous.
001:012
And
he
said
unto
them,
Take
me
up,
and
cast
me
forth
into
the
sea;
so
shall
the
sea
be
calm
unto
you:
for
I
know
that
for
my
sake
this
great
tempest
is
upon
you.
001:013
Nevertheless
the
men
rowed
hard
to
bring
it
to
the
land;
but
they
could
not:
for
the
sea
wrought,
and
was
tempestuous
against
them.
001:014
Wherefore
they
cried
unto
the
LORD,
and
said,
We
beseech
thee,
O
LORD,
we
beseech
thee,
let
us
not
perish
for
this
man's
life,
and
lay
not
upon
us
innocent
blood:
for
thou,
O
LORD,
hast
done
as
it
pleased
thee.
001:015
So
they
look
up
Jonah,
and
cast
him
forth
into
the
sea:
and
the
sea
ceased
from
her
raging.
001:016
Then
the
men
feared
the
LORD
exceedingly,
and
offered
a
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD,
and
made
vows.
001:017
Now
the
LORD
had
prepared
a
great
fish
to
swallow
up
Jonah.
And
Jonah
was
in
the
belly
of
the
fish
three
days
and
three
nights.
002:001
Then
Jonah
prayed
unto
the
LORD
his
God
out
of
the
fish's
belly,
002:002
And
said,
I
