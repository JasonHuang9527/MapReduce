thereof,
and
all
the
pins
of
the
court,
shall
be
of
brass.
027:020
And
thou
shalt
command
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
bring
thee
pure
oil
olive
beaten
for
the
light,
to
cause
the
lamp
to
burn
always.
027:021
In
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
without
the
vail,
which
is
before
the
testimony,
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
order
it
from
evening
to
morning
before
the
LORD:
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
unto
their
generations
on
the
behalf
of
the
children
of
Israel.
028:001
And
take
thou
unto
thee
Aaron
thy
brother,
and
his
sons
with
him,
from
among
the
children
of
Israel,
that
he
may
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest's
office,
even
Aaron,
Nadab
and
Abihu,
Eleazar
and
Ithamar,
Aaron's
sons.
028:002
And
thou
shalt
make
holy
garments
for
Aaron
thy
brother
for
glory
and
for
beauty.
028:003
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
all
that
are
wise
hearted,
whom
I
have
filled
with
the
spirit
of
wisdom,
that
they
may
make
Aaron's
garments
to
consecrate
him,
that
he
may
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest's
office.
028:004
And
these
are
the
garments
which
they
shall
make;
a
breastplate,
and
an
ephod,
and
a
robe,
and
a
broidered
coat,
a
mitre,
and
a
girdle:
and
they
shall
make
holy
garments
for
Aaron
thy
brother,
and
his
sons,
that
he
may
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest's
office.
028:005
And
they
shall
take
gold,
and
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
fine
linen.
028:006
And
they
shall
make
the
ephod
of
gold,
of
blue,
and
of
purple,
of
scarlet,
and
fine
twined
linen,
with
cunning
work.
028:007
It
shall
have
the
two
shoulderpieces
thereof
joined
at
the
two
edges
thereof;
and
so
it
shall
be
joined
together.
028:008
And
the
curious
girdle
of
the
ephod,
which
is
upon
it,
shall
be
of
the
same,
according
to
the
work
thereof;
even
of
gold,
of
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
fine
twined
linen.
028:009
And
thou
shalt
take
two
onyx
stones,
and
grave
on
them
the
names
of
the
children
of
Israel:
028:010
Six
of
their
names
on
one
stone,
and
the
other
six
names
of
the
rest
on
the
other
stone,
according
to
their
birth.
028:011
With
the
work
of
an
engraver
in
stone,
like
the
engravings
of
a
signet,
shalt
thou
engrave
the
two
stones
with
the
names
of
the
children
of
Israel:
thou
shalt
make
them
to
be
set
in
ouches
of
gold.
028:012
And
thou
shalt
put
the
two
stones
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
ephod
for
stones
of
memorial
unto
the
children
of
Israel:
and
Aaron
shall
bear
their
names
before
the
LORD
upon
his
two
shoulders
for
a
memorial.
028:013
And
thou
shalt
make
ouches
of
gold;
028:014
And
two
chains
of
pure
gold
at
the
ends;
of
wreathen
work
shalt
thou
make
them,
and
fasten
the
wreathen
chains
to
the
ouches.
028:015
And
thou
shalt
make
the
breastplate
of
judgment
with
cunning
work;
after
the
work
of
the
ephod
thou
shalt
make
it;
of
gold,
of
blue,
and
of
purple,
and
of
scarlet,
and
of
fine
twined
linen,
shalt
thou
make
it.
028:016
Foursquare
it
shall
be
being
doubled;
a
span
shall
be
the
length
thereof,
and
a
span
shall
be
the
breadth
thereof.
028:017
And
thou
shalt
set
in
it
settings
of
stones,
even
four
rows
of
stones:
the
first
row
shall
be
a
sardius,
a
topaz,
and
a
carbuncle:
this
shall
be
the
first
row.
028:018
And
the
second
row
shall
be
an
emerald,
a
sapphire,
and
a
diamond.
028:019
And
the
third
row
a
ligure,
an
agate,
and
an
amethyst.
028:020
And
the
fourth
row
a
beryl,
and
an
onyx,
and
a
jasper:
they
shall
be
set
in
gold
in
their
inclosings.
028:021
And
the
stones
shall
be
with
the
names
of
the
children
of
Israel,
twelve,
according
to
their
names,
like
the
engravings
of
a
signet;
every
one
with
his
name
shall
they
be
according
to
the
twelve
tribes.
028:022
And
thou
shalt
make
upon
the
breastplate
chains
at
the
ends
of
wreathen
work
of
pure
gold.
028:023
And
thou
shalt
make
upon
the
breastplate
two
rings
of
gold,
and
shalt
put
the
two
rings
on
the
two
ends
of
the
breastplate.
028:024
And
thou
shalt
put
the
two
wreathen
chains
of
gold
in
the
two
rings
which
are
on
the
ends
of
the
breastplate.
028:025
And
the
other
two
ends
of
the
two
wreathen
chains
thou
shalt
fasten
in
the
two
ouches,
and
put
them
on
the
shoulderpieces
of
the
ephod
before
it.
028:026
And
thou
shalt
make
two
rings
of
gold,
and
thou
shalt
put
them
upon
the
two
ends
of
the
breastplate
in
the
border
thereof,
which
is
in
the
side
of
the
ephod
inward.
028:027
And
two
other
rings
of
gold
thou
shalt
make,
and
shalt
put
them
on
the
two
sides
of
the
ephod
underneath,
toward
the
forepart
thereof,
over
against
the
other
coupling
thereof,
above
the
curious
girdle
of
the
ephod.
028:028
And
they
shall
bind
the
breastplate
by
the
rings
thereof
unto
the
rings
of
the
ephod
with
a
lace
of
blue,
that
it
may
be
above
the
curious
girdle
of
the
ephod,
and
that
the
breastplate
be
not
loosed
from
the
ephod.
028:029
And
Aaron
shall
bear
the
names
of
the
children
of
Israel
in
the
breastplate
of
judgment
upon
his
heart,
when
he
goeth
in
unto
the
holy
place,
for
a
memorial
before
the
LORD
continually.
028:030
And
thou
shalt
put
in
the
breastplate
of
judgment
the
Urim
and
the
Thummim;
and
they
shall
be
upon
Aaron's
heart,
when
he
goeth
in
before
the
LORD:
and
Aaron
shall
bear
the
judgment
of
the
children
of
Israel
upon
his
heart
before
the
LORD
continually.
028:031
And
thou
shalt
make
the
robe
of
the
ephod
all
of
blue.
028:032
And
there
shall
be
an
hole
in
the
top
of
it,
in
the
midst
thereof:
it
shall
have
a
binding
of
woven
work
round
about
the
hole
of
it,
as
it
were
the
hole
of
an
habergeon,
that
it
be
not
rent.
028:033
And
beneath
upon
the
hem
of
it
thou
shalt
make
pomegranates
of
blue,
and
of
purple,
and
of
scarlet,
round
about
the
hem
thereof;
and
bells
of
gold
between
them
round
about:
028:034
A
golden
bell
and
a
pomegranate,
a
golden
bell
and
a
pomegranate,
upon
the
hem
of
the
robe
round
about.
028:035
And
it
shall
be
upon
Aaron
to
minister:
and
his
sound
shall
be
heard
when
he
goeth
in
unto
the
holy
place
before
the
LORD,
and
when
he
cometh
out,
that
he
die
not.
028:036
And
thou
shalt
make
a
plate
of
pure
gold,
and
grave
upon
it,
like
the
engravings
of
a
signet,
HOLINESS
TO
THE
LORD.
028:037
And
thou
shalt
put
it
on
a
blue
lace,
that
it
may
be
upon
the
mitre;
upon
the
forefront
of
the
mitre
it
shall
be.
028:038
And
it
shall
be
upon
Aaron's
forehead,
that
Aaron
may
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
holy
things,
which
the
children
of
Israel
shall
hallow
in
all
their
holy
gifts;
and
it
shall
be
always
upon
his
forehead,
that
they
may
be
accepted
before
the
LORD.
028:039
And
thou
shalt
embroider
the
coat
of
fine
linen,
and
thou
shalt
make
the
mitre
of
fine
linen,
and
thou
shalt
make
the
girdle
of
needlework.
028:040
And
for
Aaron's
sons
thou
shalt
make
coats,
and
thou
shalt
make
for
them
girdles,
and
bonnets
shalt
thou
make
for
them,
for
glory
and
for
beauty.
028:041
And
thou
shalt
put
them
upon
Aaron
thy
brother,
and
his
sons
with
him;
and
shalt
anoint
them,
and
consecrate
them,
and
sanctify
them,
that
they
may
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest's
office.
028:042
And
thou
shalt
make
them
linen
breeches
to
cover
their
nakedness;
from
the
loins
even
unto
the
thighs
they
shall
reach:
028:043
And
they
shall
be
upon
Aaron,
and
upon
his
sons,
when
they
come
in
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
or
when
they
come
near
unto
the
altar
to
minister
in
the
holy
place;
that
they
bear
not
iniquity,
and
die:
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
unto
him
and
his
seed
after
him.
029:001
And
this
is
the
thing
that
thou
shalt
do
unto
them
to
hallow
them,
to
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest's
office:
Take
one
young
bullock,
and
two
rams
without
blemish,
029:002
And
unleavened
bread,
and
cakes
unleavened
tempered
with
oil,
and
wafers
unleavened
anointed
with
oil:
of
wheaten
flour
shalt
thou
make
them.
029:003
And
thou
shalt
put
them
into
one
basket,
and
bring
them
in
the
basket,
with
the
bullock
and
the
two
rams.
029:004
And
Aaron
and
his
sons
thou
shalt
bring
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
shalt
wash
them
with
water.
029:005
And
thou
shalt
take
the
garments,
and
put
upon
Aaron
the
coat,
and
the
robe
of
the
ephod,
and
the
ephod,
and
the
breastplate,
and
gird
him
with
the
curious
girdle
of
the
ephod:
029:006
And
thou
shalt
put
the
mitre
upon
his
head,
and
put
the
holy
crown
upon
the
mitre.
029:007
Then
shalt
thou
take
the
anointing
oil,
and
pour
it
upon
his
head,
and
anoint
him.
029:008
And
thou
shalt
bring
his
sons,
and
put
coats
upon
them.
029:009
And
thou
shalt
gird
them
with
girdles,
Aaron
and
his
sons,
and
put
the
bonnets
on
them:
and
the
priest's
office
shall
be
theirs
for
a
perpetual
statute:
and
thou
shalt
consecrate
Aaron
and
his
sons.
029:010
And
thou
shalt
cause
a
bullock
to
be
brought
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
put
their
hands
upon
the
head
of
the
bullock.
029:011
And
thou
shalt
kill
the
bullock
before
the
LORD,
by
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
029:012
And
thou
shalt
take
of
the
blood
of
the
bullock,
and
put
it
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar
with
thy
finger,
and
pour
all
the
blood
beside
the
bottom
of
the
altar.
029:013
And
thou
shalt
take
all
the
fat
that
covereth
the
inwards,
and
the
caul
that
is
above
the
liver,
and
the
two
kidneys,
and
the
fat
that
is
upon
them,
and
burn
them
upon
the
altar.
029:014
But
the
flesh
of
the
bullock,
and
his
skin,
and
his
dung,
shalt
thou
burn
with
fire
without
the
camp:
it
is
a
sin
offering.
029:015
Thou
shalt
also
take
one
ram;
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
put
their
hands
upon
the
head
of
the
ram.
029:016
And
thou
shalt
slay
the
ram,
and
thou
shalt
take
his
blood,
and
sprinkle
it
round
about
upon
the
altar.
029:017
And
thou
shalt
cut
the
ram
in
pieces,
and
wash
the
inwards
of
him,
and
his
legs,
and
put
them
unto
his
pieces,
and
unto
his
head.
029:018
And
thou
shalt
burn
the
whole
ram
upon
the
altar:
it
is
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
LORD:
it
is
a
sweet
savour,
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
029:019
And
thou
shalt
take
the
other
ram;
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
put
their
hands
upon
the
head
of
the
ram.
029:020
Then
shalt
thou
kill
the
ram,
and
take
of
his
blood,
and
put
it
upon
the
tip
of
the
right
ear
of
Aaron,
and
upon
the
tip
of
the
right
ear
of
his
sons,
and
upon
the
thumb
of
their
right
hand,
and
upon
the
great
toe
of
their
right
foot,
and
sprinkle
the
blood
upon
the
altar
round
about.
029:021
And
thou
shalt
take
of
the
blood
that
is
upon
the
altar,
and
of
the
anointing
oil,
and
sprinkle
it
upon
Aaron,
and
upon
his
garments,
and
upon
his
sons,
and
upon
the
garments
of
his
sons
with
him:
and
he
shall
be
hallowed,
and
his
garments,
and
his
sons,
and
his
sons'
garments
with
him.
029:022
Also
thou
shalt
take
of
the
ram
the
fat
and
the
rump,
and
the
fat
that
covereth
the
inwards,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver,
and
the
two
kidneys,
and
the
fat
that
is
upon
them,
and
the
right
shoulder;
for
it
is
a
ram
of
consecration:
029:023
And
one
loaf
of
bread,
and
one
cake
of
oiled
bread,
and
one
wafer
out
of
the
basket
of
the
unleavened
bread
that
is
before
the
LORD:
029:024
And
thou
shalt
put
all
in
the
hands
of
Aaron,
and
in
the
hands
of
his
sons;
and
shalt
wave
them
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD.
029:025
And
thou
shalt
receive
them
of
their
hands,
and
burn
them
upon
the
altar
for
a
burnt
offering,
for
a
sweet
savour
before
the
LORD:
it
is
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
029:026
And
thou
shalt
take
the
breast
of
the
ram
of
Aaron's
consecration,
and
wave
it
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD:
and
it
shall
be
thy
part.
029:027
And
thou
shalt
sanctify
the
breast
of
the
wave
offering,
and
the
shoulder
of
the
heave
offering,
which
is
waved,
and
which
is
heaved
up,
of
the
ram
of
the
consecration,
even
of
that
which
is
for
Aaron,
and
of
that
which
is
for
his
sons:
029:028
And
it
shall
be
Aaron's
and
his
sons'
by
a
statute
for
ever
from
the
children
of
Israel:
for
it
is
an
heave
offering:
and
it
shall
be
an
heave
offering
from
the
children
of
Israel
of
the
sacrifice
of
their
peace
offerings,
even
their
heave
offering
unto
the
LORD.
029:029
And
the
holy
garments
of
Aaron
shall
be
his
sons'
after
him,
to
be
anointed
therein,
and
to
be
consecrated
in
them.
029:030
And
that
son
that
is
priest
in
his
stead
shall
put
them
on
seven
days,
when
he
cometh
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
to
minister
in
the
holy
place.
029:031
And
thou
shalt
take
the
ram
of
the
consecration,
and
seethe
his
flesh
in
the
holy
place.
029:032
And
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
eat
the
flesh
of
the
ram,
and
the
bread
that
is
in
the
basket
by
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
029:033
And
they
shall
eat
those
things
wherewith
the
atonement
was
made,
to
consecrate
and
to
sanctify
them:
but
a
stranger
shall
not
eat
thereof,
because
they
are
holy.
029:034
And
if
ought
of
the
flesh
of
the
consecrations,
or
of
the
bread,
remain
unto
the
morning,
then
thou
shalt
burn
the
remainder
with
fire:
it
shall
not
be
eaten,
because
it
is
holy.
029:035
And
thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
Aaron,
and
to
his
sons,
according
to
all
things
which
I
have
commanded
thee:
seven
days
shalt
thou
consecrate
them.
029:036
And
thou
shalt
offer
every
day
a
bullock
for
a
sin
offering
for
atonement:
and
thou
shalt
cleanse
the
altar,
when
thou
hast
made
an
atonement
for
it,
and
thou
shalt
anoint
it,
to
sanctify
it.
029:037
Seven
days
thou
shalt
make
an
atonement
for
the
altar,
and
sanctify
it;
and
it
shall
be
an
altar
most
holy:
whatsoever
toucheth
the
altar
shall
be
holy.
029:038
Now
this
is
that
which
thou
shalt
offer
upon
the
altar;
two
lambs
of
the
first
year
day
by
day
continually.
029:039
The
one
lamb
thou
shalt
offer
in
the
morning;
and
the
other
lamb
thou
shalt
offer
at
even:
029:040
And
with
the
one
lamb
a
tenth
deal
of
flour
mingled
with
the
fourth
part
of
an
hin
of
beaten
oil;
and
the
fourth
part
of
an
hin
of
wine
for
a
drink
offering.
029:041
And
the
other
lamb
thou
shalt
offer
at
even,
and
shalt
do
thereto
according
to
the
meat
offering
of
the
morning,
and
according
to
the
drink
offering
thereof,
for
a
sweet
savour,
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
029:042
This
shall
be
a
continual
burnt
offering
throughout
your
generations
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
the
LORD:
where
I
will
meet
you,
to
speak
there
unto
thee.
029:043
And
there
I
will
meet
with
the
children
of
Israel,
and
the
tabernacle
shall
be
sanctified
by
my
glory.
029:044
And
I
will
sanctify
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
the
altar:
I
will
sanctify
also
both
Aaron
and
his
sons,
to
minister
to
me
in
the
priest's
office.
029:045
And
I
will
dwell
among
the
children
of
Israel,
and
will
be
their
God.
029:046
And
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
their
God,
that
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
that
I
may
dwell
among
them:
I
am
the
LORD
their
God.
030:001
And
thou
shalt
make
an
altar
to
burn
incense
upon:
of
shittim
wood
shalt
thou
make
it.
030:002
A
cubit
shall
be
the
length
thereof,
and
a
cubit
the
breadth
thereof;
foursquare
shall
it
be:
and
two
cubits
shall
be
the
height
thereof:
the
horns
thereof
shall
be
of
the
same.
030:003
And
thou
shalt
overlay
it
with
pure
gold,
the
top
thereof,
and
the
sides
thereof
round
about,
and
the
horns
thereof;
and
thou
shalt
make
unto
it
a
crown
of
gold
round
about.
030:004
And
two
golden
rings
shalt
thou
make
to
it
under
the
crown
of
it,
by
the
two
corners
thereof,
upon
the
two
sides
of
it
shalt
thou
make
it;
and
they
shall
be
for
places
for
the
staves
to
bear
it
withal.
030:005
And
thou
shalt
make
the
staves
of
shittim
wood,
and
overlay
them
with
gold.
030:006
And
thou
shalt
put
it
before
the
vail
that
is
by
the
ark
of
the
testimony,
before
the
mercy
seat
that
is
over
the
testimony,
where
I
will
meet
with
thee.
030:007
And
Aaron
shall
burn
thereon
sweet
incense
every
morning:
when
he
dresseth
the
lamps,
he
shall
burn
incense
upon
it.
030:008
And
when
Aaron
lighteth
the
lamps
at
even,
he
shall
burn
incense
upon
it,
a
perpetual
incense
before
the
LORD
throughout
your
generations.
030:009
Ye
shall
offer
no
strange
incense
thereon,
nor
burnt
sacrifice,
nor
meat
offering;
neither
shall
ye
pour
drink
offering
thereon.
030:010
And
Aaron
shall
make
an
atonement
upon
the
horns
of
it
once
in
a
year
with
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
of
atonements:
once
in
the
year
shall
he
make
atonement
upon
it
throughout
your
generations:
it
is
most
holy
unto
the
LORD.
030:011
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
030:012
When
thou
takest
the
sum
of
the
children
of
Israel
after
their
number,
then
shall
they
give
every
man
a
ransom
for
his
soul
unto
the
LORD,
when
thou
numberest
them;
that
there
be
no
plague
among
them,
when
thou
numberest
them.
030:013
This
they
shall
give,
every
one
that
passeth
among
them
that
are
numbered,
half
a
shekel
after
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary:
(a
shekel
is
twenty
gerahs:)
an
half
shekel
shall
be
the
offering
of
the
LORD.
030:014
Every
one
that
passeth
among
them
that
are
numbered,
from
twenty
years
old
and
above,
shall
give
an
offering
unto
the
LORD.
030:015
The
rich
shall
not
give
more,
and
the
poor
shall
not
give
less
than
half
a
shekel,
when
they
give
an
offering
unto
the
LORD,
to
make
an
atonement
for
your
souls.
030:016
And
thou
shalt
take
the
atonement
money
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
shalt
appoint
it
for
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation;
that
it
may
be
a
memorial
unto
the
children
of
Israel
before
the
LORD,
to
make
an
atonement
for
your
souls.
030:017
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
030:018
Thou
shalt
also
make
a
laver
of
brass,
and
his
foot
also
of
brass,
to
wash
withal:
and
thou
shalt
put
it
between
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
altar,
and
thou
shalt
put
water
therein.
030:019
For
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
wash
their
hands
and
their
feet
thereat:
030:020
When
they
go
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
they
shall
wash
with
water,
that
they
die
not;
or
when
they
come
near
to
the
altar
to
minister,
to
burn
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD:
030:021
So
they
shall
wash
their
hands
and
their
feet,
that
they
die
not:
and
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
to
them,
even
to
him
and
to
his
seed
throughout
their
generations.
030:022
Moreover
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
030:023
Take
thou
also
unto
thee
principal
spices,
of
pure
myrrh
five
hundred
shekels,
and
of
sweet
cinnamon
half
so
much,
even
two
hundred
and
fifty
shekels,
and
of
sweet
calamus
two
hundred
and
fifty
shekels,
030:024
And
of
cassia
five
hundred
shekels,
after
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary,
and
of
oil
olive
an
hin:
030:025
And
thou
shalt
make
it
an
oil
of
holy
ointment,
an
ointment
compound
after
the
art
of
the
apothecary:
it
shall
be
an
holy
anointing
oil.
030:026
And
thou
shalt
anoint
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
therewith,
and
the
ark
of
the
testimony,
030:027
And
the
table
and
all
his
vessels,
and
the
candlestick
and
his
vessels,
and
the
altar
of
incense,
030:028
And
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
with
all
his
vessels,
and
the
laver
and
his
foot.
030:029
And
thou
shalt
sanctify
them,
that
they
may
be
most
holy:
whatsoever
toucheth
them
shall
be
holy.
030:030
And
thou
shalt
anoint
Aaron
and
his
sons,
and
consecrate
them,
that
they
may
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest's
office.
030:031
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
This
shall
be
an
holy
anointing
oil
unto
me
throughout
your
generations.
030:032
Upon
man's
flesh
shall
it
not
be
poured,
neither
shall
ye
make
any
other
like
it,
after
the
composition
of
it:
it
is
holy,
and
it
shall
be
holy
unto
you.
030:033
Whosoever
compoundeth
any
like
it,
or
whosoever
putteth
any
of
it
upon
a
stranger,
shall
even
be
cut
off
from
his
people.
030:034
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Take
unto
thee
sweet
spices,
stacte,
and
onycha,
and
galbanum;
these
sweet
spices
with
pure
frankincense:
of
each
shall
there
be
a
like
weight:
030:035
And
thou
shalt
make
it
a
perfume,
a
confection
after
the
art
of
the
apothecary,
tempered
together,
pure
and
holy:
030:036
And
thou
shalt
beat
some
of
it
very
small,
and
put
of
it
before
the
testimony
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
where
I
will
meet
with
thee:
it
shall
be
unto
you
most
holy.
030:037
And
as
for
the
perfume
which
thou
shalt
make,
ye
shall
not
make
to
yourselves
according
to
the
composition
thereof:
it
shall
be
unto
thee
holy
for
the
LORD.
030:038
Whosoever
shall
make
like
unto
that,
to
smell
thereto,
shall
even
be
cut
off
from
his
people.
031:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
031:002
See,
I
have
called
by
name
Bezaleel
the
son
of
Uri,
the
son
of
Hur,
of
the
tribe
of
Judah:
031:003
And
I
have
filled
him
with
the
spirit
of
God,
in
wisdom,
and
in
understanding,
and
in
knowledge,
and
in
all
manner
of
workmanship,
031:004
To
devise
cunning
works,
to
work
in
gold,
and
in
silver,
and
in
brass,
031:005
And
in
cutting
of
stones,
to
set
them,
and
in
carving
of
timber,
to
work
in
all
manner
of
workmanship.
031:006
And
I,
behold,
I
have
given
with
him
Aholiab,
the
son
of
Ahisamach,
of
the
tribe
of
Dan:
and
in
the
hearts
of
all
that
are
wise
hearted
I
have
put
wisdom,
that
they
may
make
all
that
I
have
commanded
thee;
031:007
The
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
the
ark
of
the
testimony,
and
the
mercy
seat
that
is
thereupon,
and
all
the
furniture
of
the
tabernacle,
031:008
And
the
table
and
his
furniture,
and
the
pure
candlestick
with
all
his
furniture,
and
the
altar
of
incense,
031:009
And
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
with
all
his
furniture,
and
the
laver
and
his
foot,
031:010
And
the
cloths
of
service,
and
the
holy
garments
for
Aaron
the
priest,
and
the
garments
of
his
sons,
to
minister
in
the
priest's
office,
031:011
And
the
anointing
oil,
and
sweet
incense
for
the
holy
place:
according
to
all
that
I
have
commanded
thee
shall
they
do.
031:012
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
031:013
Speak
thou
also
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
Verily
my
sabbaths
ye
shall
keep:
for
it
is
a
sign
between
me
and
you
throughout
your
generations;
that
ye
may
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
that
doth
sanctify
you.
031:014
Ye
shall
keep
the
sabbath
therefore;
for
it
is
holy
unto
you:
every
one
that
defileth
it
shall
surely
be
put
to
death:
for
whosoever
doeth
any
work
therein,
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people.
031:015
Six
days
