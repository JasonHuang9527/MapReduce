is
jealous,
and
the
LORD
revengeth;
the
LORD
revengeth,
and
is
furious;
the
LORD
will
take
vengeance
on
his
adversaries,
and
he
reserveth
wrath
for
his
enemies.
001:003
The
LORD
is
slow
to
anger,
and
great
in
power,
and
will
not
at
all
acquit
the
wicked:
the
LORD
hath
his
way
in
the
whirlwind
and
in
the
storm,
and
the
clouds
are
the
dust
of
his
feet.
001:004
He
rebuketh
the
sea,
and
maketh
it
dry,
and
drieth
up
all
the
rivers:
Bashan
languisheth,
and
Carmel,
and
the
flower
of
Lebanon
languisheth.
001:005
The
mountains
quake
at
him,
and
the
hills
melt,
and
the
earth
is
burned
at
his
presence,
yea,
the
world,
and
all
that
dwell
therein.
001:006
Who
can
stand
before
his
indignation?
and
who
can
abide
in
the
fierceness
of
his
anger?
his
fury
is
poured
out
like
fire,
and
the
rocks
are
thrown
down
by
him.
001:007
The
LORD
is
good,
a
strong
hold
in
the
day
of
trouble;
and
he
knoweth
them
that
trust
in
him.
001:008
But
with
an
overrunning
flood
he
will
make
an
utter
end
of
the
place
thereof,
and
darkness
shall
pursue
his
enemies.
001:009
What
do
ye
imagine
against
the
LORD?
he
will
make
an
utter
end:
affliction
shall
not
rise
up
the
second
time.
001:010
For
while
they
be
folden
together
as
thorns,
and
while
they
are
drunken
as
drunkards,
they
shall
be
devoured
as
stubble
fully
dry.
001:011
There
is
one
come
out
of
thee,
that
imagineth
evil
against
the
LORD,
a
wicked
counsellor.
001:012
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
Though
they
be
quiet,
and
likewise
many,
yet
thus
shall
they
be
cut
down,
when
he
shall
pass
through.
Though
I
have
afflicted
thee,
I
will
afflict
thee
no
more.
001:013
For
now
will
I
break
his
yoke
from
off
thee,
and
will
burst
thy
bonds
in
sunder.
001:014
And
the
LORD
hath
given
a
commandment
concerning
thee,
that
no
more
of
thy
name
be
sown:
out
of
the
house
of
thy
gods
will
I
cut
off
the
graven
image
and
the
molten
image:
I
will
make
thy
grave;
for
thou
art
vile.
001:015
Behold
upon
the
mountains
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings,
that
publisheth
peace!
O
Judah,
keep
thy
solemn
feasts,
perform
thy
vows:
for
the
wicked
shall
no
more
pass
through
thee;
he
is
utterly
cut
off.
002:001
He
that
dasheth
in
pieces
is
come
up
before
thy
face:
keep
the
munition,
watch
the
way,
make
thy
loins
strong,
fortify
thy
power
mightily.
002:002
For
the
LORD
hath
turned
away
the
excellency
of
Jacob,
as
the
excellency
of
Israel:
for
the
emptiers
have
emptied
them
out,
and
marred
their
vine
branches.
002:003
The
shield
of
his
mighty
men
is
made
red,
the
valiant
men
are
in
scarlet:
the
chariots
shall
be
with
flaming
torches
in
the
day
of
his
preparation,
and
the
fir
trees
shall
be
terribly
shaken.
002:004
The
chariots
shall
rage
in
the
streets,
they
shall
justle
one
against
another
in
the
broad
ways:
they
shall
seem
like
torches,
they
shall
run
like
the
lightnings.
002:005
He
shall
recount
his
worthies:
they
shall
stumble
in
their
walk;
they
shall
make
haste
to
the
wall
thereof,
and
the
defence
shall
be
prepared.
002:006
The
gates
of
the
rivers
shall
be
opened,
and
the
palace
shall
be
dissolved.
002:007
And
Huzzab
shall
be
led
away
captive,
she
shall
be
brought
up,
and
her
maids
shall
lead
her
as
with
the
voice
of
doves,
tabering
upon
their
breasts.
002:008
But
Nineveh
is
of
old
like
a
pool
of
water:
yet
they
shall
flee
away.
Stand,
stand,
shall
they
cry;
but
none
shall
look
back.
002:009
Take
ye
the
spoil
of
silver,
take
the
spoil
of
gold:
for
there
is
none
end
of
the
store
and
glory
out
of
all
the
pleasant
furniture.
002:010
She
is
empty,
and
void,
and
waste:
and
the
heart
melteth,
and
the
knees
smite
together,
and
much
pain
is
in
all
loins,
and
the
faces
of
them
all
gather
blackness.
002:011
Where
is
the
dwelling
of
the
lions,
and
the
feedingplace
of
the
young
lions,
where
the
lion,
even
the
old
lion,
walked,
and
the
lion's
whelp,
and
none
made
them
afraid?
002:012
The
lion
did
tear
in
pieces
enough
for
his
whelps,
and
strangled
for
his
lionesses,
and
filled
his
holes
with
prey,
and
his
dens
with
ravin.
002:013
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
I
will
burn
her
chariots
in
the
smoke,
and
the
sword
shall
devour
thy
young
lions:
and
I
will
cut
off
thy
prey
from
the
earth,
and
the
voice
of
thy
messengers
shall
no
more
be
heard.
003:001
Woe
to
the
bloody
city!
it
is
all
full
of
lies
and
robbery;
the
prey
departeth
not;
003:002
The
noise
of
a
whip,
and
the
noise
of
the
rattling
of
the
wheels,
and
of
the
pransing
horses,
and
of
the
jumping
chariots.
003:003
The
horseman
lifteth
up
both
the
bright
sword
and
the
glittering
spear:
and
there
is
a
multitude
of
slain,
and
a
great
number
of
carcases;
and
there
is
none
end
of
their
corpses;
they
stumble
upon
their
corpses:
003:004
Because
of
the
multitude
of
the
whoredoms
of
the
wellfavoured
harlot,
the
mistress
of
witchcrafts,
that
selleth
nations
through
her
whoredoms,
and
families
through
her
witchcrafts.
003:005
Behold,
I
am
against
thee,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
and
I
will
discover
thy
skirts
upon
thy
face,
and
I
will
shew
the
nations
thy
nakedness,
and
the
kingdoms
thy
shame.
003:006
And
I
will
cast
abominable
filth
upon
thee,
and
make
thee
vile,
and
will
set
thee
as
a
gazingstock.
003:007
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
all
they
that
look
upon
thee
shall
flee
from
thee,
and
say,
Nineveh
is
laid
waste:
who
will
bemoan
her?
whence
shall
I
seek
comforters
for
thee?
003:008
Art
thou
better
than
populous
No,
that
was
situate
among
the
rivers,
that
had
the
waters
round
about
it,
whose
rampart
was
the
sea,
and
her
wall
was
from
the
sea?
003:009
Ethiopia
and
Egypt
were
her
strength,
and
it
was
infinite;
Put
and
Lubim
were
thy
helpers.
003:010
Yet
was
she
carried
away,
she
went
into
captivity:
her
young
children
also
were
dashed
in
pieces
at
the
top
of
all
the
streets:
and
they
cast
lots
for
her
honourable
men,
and
all
her
great
men
were
bound
in
chains.
003:011
Thou
also
shalt
be
drunken:
thou
shalt
be
hid,
thou
also
shalt
seek
strength
because
of
the
enemy.
003:012
All
thy
strong
holds
shall
be
like
fig
trees
with
the
firstripe
figs:
if
they
be
shaken,
they
shall
even
fall
into
the
mouth
of
the
eater.
003:013
Behold,
thy
people
in
the
midst
of
thee
are
women:
the
gates
of
thy
land
shall
be
set
wide
open
unto
thine
enemies:
the
fire
shall
devour
thy
bars.
003:014
Draw
thee
waters
for
the
siege,
fortify
thy
strong
holds:
go
into
clay,
and
tread
the
morter,
make
strong
the
brickkiln.
003:015
There
shall
the
fire
devour
thee;
the
sword
shall
cut
thee
off,
it
shall
eat
thee
up
like
the
cankerworm:
make
thyself
many
as
the
cankerworm,
make
thyself
many
as
the
locusts.
003:016
Thou
hast
multiplied
thy
merchants
above
the
stars
of
heaven:
the
cankerworm
spoileth,
and
fleeth
away.
003:017
Thy
crowned
are
as
the
locusts,
and
thy
captains
as
the
great
grasshoppers,
which
camp
in
the
hedges
in
the
cold
day,
but
when
the
sun
ariseth
they
flee
away,
and
their
place
is
not
known
where
they
are.
003:018
Thy
shepherds
slumber,
O
king
of
Assyria:
thy
nobles
shall
dwell
in
the
dust:
thy
people
is
scattered
upon
the
mountains,
and
no
man
gathereth
them.
003:019
There
is
no
healing
of
thy
bruise;
thy
wound
is
grievous:
all
that
hear
the
bruit
of
thee
shall
clap
the
hands
over
thee:
for
upon
whom
hath
not
thy
wickedness
passed
continually?
Book
35	Habakkuk
001:001
The
burden
which
Habakkuk
the
prophet
did
see.
001:002
O
LORD,
how
long
shall
I
cry,
and
thou
wilt
not
hear!
even
cry
out
unto
thee
of
violence,
and
thou
wilt
not
save!
001:003
Why
dost
thou
shew
me
iniquity,
and
cause
me
to
behold
grievance?
for
spoiling
and
violence
are
before
me:
and
there
are
that
raise
up
strife
and
contention.
001:004
Therefore
the
law
is
slacked,
and
judgment
doth
never
go
forth:
for
the
wicked
doth
compass
about
the
righteous;
therefore
wrong
judgment
proceedeth.
001:005
Behold
ye
among
the
heathen,
and
regard,
and
wonder
marvelously:
for
I
will
work
a
work
in
your
days
which
ye
will
not
believe,
though
it
be
told
you.
001:006
For,
lo,
I
raise
up
the
Chaldeans,
that
bitter
and
hasty
nation,
which
shall
march
through
the
breadth
of
the
land,
to
possess
the
dwellingplaces
that
are
not
their's.
001:007
They
are
terrible
and
dreadful:
their
judgment
and
their
dignity
shall
proceed
of
themselves.
001:008
Their
horses
also
are
swifter
than
the
leopards,
and
are
more
fierce
than
the
evening
wolves:
and
their
horsemen
shall
spread
themselves,
and
their
horsemen
shall
come
from
far;
they
shall
fly
as
the
eagle
that
hasteth
to
eat.
001:009
They
shall
come
all
for
violence:
their
faces
shall
sup
up
as
the
east
wind,
and
they
shall
gather
the
captivity
as
the
sand.
001:010
And
they
shall
scoff
at
the
kings,
and
the
princes
shall
be
a
scorn
unto
them:
they
shall
deride
every
strong
hold;
for
they
shall
heap
dust,
and
take
it.
001:011
Then
shall
his
mind
change,
and
he
shall
pass
over,
and
offend,
imputing
this
his
power
unto
his
god.
001:012
Art
thou
not
from
everlasting,
O
LORD
my
God,
mine
Holy
One?
we
shall
not
die.
O
LORD,
thou
hast
ordained
them
for
judgment;
and,
O
mighty
God,
thou
hast
established
them
for
correction.
001:013
Thou
art
of
purer
eyes
than
to
behold
evil,
and
canst
not
look
on
iniquity:
wherefore
lookest
thou
upon
them
that
deal
treacherously,
and
holdest
thy
tongue
when
the
wicked
devoureth
the
man
that
is
more
righteous
than
he?
001:014
And
makest
men
as
the
fishes
of
the
sea,
as
the
creeping
things,
that
have
no
ruler
over
them?
001:015
They
take
up
all
of
them
with
the
angle,
they
catch
them
in
their
net,
and
gather
them
in
their
drag:
therefore
they
rejoice
and
are
glad.
001:016
Therefore
they
sacrifice
unto
their
net,
and
burn
incense
unto
their
drag;
because
by
them
their
portion
is
fat,
and
their
meat
plenteous.
001:017
Shall
they
therefore
empty
their
net,
and
not
spare
continually
to
slay
the
nations?
002:001
I
will
stand
upon
my
watch,
and
set
me
upon
the
tower,
and
will
watch
to
see
what
he
will
say
unto
me,
and
what
I
shall
answer
when
I
am
reproved.
002:002
And
the
LORD
answered
me,
and
said,
Write
the
vision,
and
make
it
plain
upon
tables,
that
he
may
run
that
readeth
it.
002:003
For
the
vision
is
yet
for
an
appointed
time,
but
at
the
end
it
shall
speak,
and
not
lie:
though
it
tarry,
wait
for
it;
because
it
will
surely
come,
it
will
not
tarry.
002:004
Behold,
his
soul
which
is
lifted
up
is
not
upright
in
him:
but
the
just
shall
live
by
his
faith.
002:005
Yea
also,
because
he
transgresseth
by
wine,
he
is
a
proud
man,
neither
keepeth
at
home,
who
enlargeth
his
desire
as
hell,
and
is
as
death,
and
cannot
be
satisfied,
but
gathereth
unto
him
all
nations,
and
heapeth
unto
him
all
people:
002:006
Shall
not
all
these
take
up
a
parable
against
him,
and
a
taunting
proverb
against
him,
and
say,
Woe
to
him
that
increaseth
that
which
is
not
his!
how
long?
and
to
him
that
ladeth
himself
with
thick
clay!
002:007
Shall
they
not
rise
up
suddenly
that
shall
bite
thee,
and
awake
that
shall
vex
thee,
and
thou
shalt
be
for
booties
unto
them?
002:008
Because
thou
hast
spoiled
many
nations,
all
the
remnant
of
the
people
shall
spoil
thee;
because
of
men's
blood,
and
for
the
violence
of
the
land,
of
the
city,
and
of
all
that
dwell
therein.
002:009
Woe
to
him
that
coveteth
an
evil
covetousness
to
his
house,
that
he
may
set
his
nest
on
high,
that
he
may
be
delivered
from
the
power
of
evil!
002:010
Thou
hast
consulted
shame
to
thy
house
by
cutting
off
many
people,
and
hast
sinned
against
thy
soul.
002:011
For
the
stone
shall
cry
out
of
the
wall,
and
the
beam
out
of
the
timber
shall
answer
it.
002:012
Woe
to
him
that
buildeth
a
town
with
blood,
and
stablisheth
a
city
by
iniquity!
002:013
Behold,
is
it
not
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
that
the
people
shall
labour
in
the
very
fire,
and
the
people
shall
weary
themselves
for
very
vanity?
002:014
For
the
earth
shall
be
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
the
LORD,
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea.
002:015
Woe
unto
him
that
giveth
his
neighbour
drink,
that
puttest
thy
bottle
to
him,
and
makest
him
drunken
also,
that
thou
mayest
look
on
their
nakedness!
002:016
Thou
art
filled
with
shame
for
glory:
drink
thou
also,
and
let
thy
foreskin
be
uncovered:
the
cup
of
the
LORD's
right
hand
shall
be
turned
unto
thee,
and
shameful
spewing
shall
be
on
thy
glory.
002:017
For
the
violence
of
Lebanon
shall
cover
thee,
and
the
spoil
of
beasts,
which
made
them
afraid,
because
of
men's
blood,
and
for
the
violence
of
the
land,
of
the
city,
and
of
all
that
dwell
therein.
002:018
What
profiteth
the
graven
image
that
the
maker
thereof
hath
graven
it;
the
molten
image,
and
a
teacher
of
lies,
that
the
maker
of
his
work
trusteth
therein,
to
make
dumb
idols?
002:019
Woe
unto
him
that
saith
to
the
wood,
Awake;
to
the
dumb
stone,
Arise,
it
shall
teach!
Behold,
it
is
laid
over
with
gold
and
silver,
and
there
is
no
breath
at
all
in
the
midst
of
it.
002:020
But
the
LORD
is
in
his
holy
temple:
let
all
the
earth
keep
silence
before
him.
003:001
A
prayer
of
Habakkuk
the
prophet
upon
Shigionoth.
003:002
O
LORD,
I
have
heard
thy
speech,
and
was
afraid:
O
LORD,
revive
thy
work
in
the
midst
of
the
years,
in
the
midst
of
the
years
make
known;
in
wrath
remember
mercy.
003:003
God
came
from
Teman,
and
the
Holy
One
from
mount
Paran.
Selah.
His
glory
covered
the
heavens,
and
the
earth
was
full
of
his
praise.
003:004
And
his
brightness
was
as
the
light;
he
had
horns
coming
out
of
his
hand:
and
there
was
the
hiding
of
his
power.
003:005
Before
him
went
the
pestilence,
and
burning
coals
went
forth
at
his
feet.
003:006
He
stood,
and
measured
the
earth:
he
beheld,
and
drove
asunder
the
nations;
and
the
everlasting
mountains
were
scattered,
the
perpetual
hills
did
bow:
his
ways
are
everlasting.
003:007
I
saw
the
tents
of
Cushan
in
affliction:
and
the
curtains
of
the
land
of
Midian
did
tremble.
003:008
Was
the
LORD
displeased
against
the
rivers?
was
thine
anger
against
the
rivers?
was
thy
wrath
against
the
sea,
that
thou
didst
ride
upon
thine
horses
and
thy
chariots
of
salvation?
003:009
Thy
bow
was
made
quite
naked,
according
to
the
oaths
of
the
tribes,
even
thy
word.
Selah.
Thou
didst
cleave
the
earth
with
rivers.
003:010
The
mountains
saw
thee,
and
they
trembled:
the
overflowing
of
the
water
passed
by:
the
deep
uttered
his
voice,
and
lifted
up
his
hands
on
high.
003:011
The
sun
and
moon
stood
still
in
their
habitation:
at
the
light
of
thine
arrows
they
went,
and
at
the
shining
of
thy
glittering
spear.
003:012
Thou
didst
march
through
the
land
in
indignation,
thou
didst
thresh
the
heathen
in
anger.
003:013
Thou
wentest
forth
for
the
salvation
of
thy
people,
even
for
salvation
with
thine
anointed;
thou
woundedst
the
head
out
of
the
house
of
the
wicked,
by
discovering
the
foundation
unto
the
neck.
Selah.
003:014
Thou
didst
strike
through
with
his
staves
the
head
of
his
villages:
they
came
out
as
a
whirlwind
to
scatter
me:
their
rejoicing
was
as
to
devour
the
poor
secretly.
003:015
Thou
didst
walk
through
the
sea
with
thine
horses,
through
the
heap
of
great
waters.
003:016
When
I
heard,
my
belly
trembled;
my
lips
quivered
at
the
voice:
rottenness
entered
into
my
bones,
and
I
trembled
in
myself,
that
I
might
rest
in
the
day
of
trouble:
when
he
cometh
up
unto
the
people,
he
will
invade
them
with
his
troops.
003:017
Although
the
fig
tree
shall
not
blossom,
neither
shall
fruit
be
in
the
vines;
the
labour
of
the
olive
shall
fail,
and
the
fields
shall
yield
no
meat;
the
flock
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
fold,
and
there
shall
be
no
herd
in
the
stalls:
003:018
Yet
I
will
rejoice
in
the
LORD,
I
will
joy
in
the
God
of
my
salvation.
003:019
The
LORD
God
is
my
strength,
and
he
will
make
my
feet
like
hinds'
feet,
and
he
will
make
me
to
walk
upon
mine
high
places.
To
the
chief
singer
on
my
stringed
instruments.
Book
36	Zephaniah
001:001
The
word
of
the
LORD
which
came
unto
Zephaniah
the
son
of
Cushi,
the
son
of
Gedaliah,
the
son
of
Amariah,
the
son
of
Hizkiah,
in
the
days
of
Josiah
the
son
of
Amon,
king
of
Judah.
001:002
I
will
utterly
consume
all
things
from
off
the
land,
saith
the
LORD.
001:003
I
will
consume
man
and
beast;
I
will
consume
the
fowls
of
the
heaven,
and
the
fishes
of
the
sea,
and
the
stumblingblocks
with
the
wicked:
and
I
will
cut
off
man
from
off
the
land,
saith
the
LORD.
001:004
I
will
also
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
Judah,
and
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem;
and
I
will
cut
off
the
remnant
of
Baal
from
this
place,
and
the
name
of
the
Chemarims
with
the
priests;
001:005
And
them
that
worship
the
host
of
heaven
upon
the
housetops;
and
them
that
worship
and
that
swear
by
the
LORD,
and
that
swear
by
Malcham;
001:006
And
them
that
are
turned
back
from
the
LORD;
and
those
that
have
not
sought
the
LORD,
nor
enquired
for
him.
001:007
Hold
thy
peace
at
the
presence
of
the
Lord
GOD:
for
the
day
of
the
LORD
is
at
hand:
for
the
LORD
hath
prepared
a
sacrifice,
he
hath
bid
his
guests.
001:008
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
day
of
the
LORD's
sacrifice,
that
I
will
punish
the
princes,
and
the
king's
children,
and
all
such
as
are
clothed
with
strange
apparel.
001:009
In
the
same
day
also
will
I
punish
all
those
that
leap
on
the
threshold,
which
fill
their
masters'
houses
with
violence
and
deceit.
001:010
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
saith
the
LORD,
that
there
shall
be
the
noise
of
a
cry
from
the
fish
gate,
and
an
howling
from
the
second,
and
a
great
crashing
from
the
hills.
001:011
Howl,
ye
inhabitants
of
Maktesh,
for
all
the
merchant
people
are
cut
down;
all
they
that
bear
silver
are
cut
off.
001:012
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
at
that
time,
that
I
will
search
Jerusalem
with
candles,
and
punish
the
men
that
are
settled
on
their
lees:
that
say
in
their
heart,
The
LORD
will
not
do
good,
neither
will
he
do
evil.
001:013
Therefore
their
goods
shall
become
a
booty,
and
their
houses
a
desolation:
they
shall
also
build
houses,
but
not
inhabit
them;
and
they
shall
plant
vineyards,
but
not
drink
the
wine
thereof.
001:014
The
great
day
of
the
LORD
is
near,
it
is
near,
and
hasteth
greatly,
even
the
voice
of
the
day
of
the
LORD:
the
mighty
man
shall
cry
there
bitterly.
001:015
That
day
is
a
day
of
wrath,
a
day
of
trouble
and
distress,
a
day
of
wasteness
and
desolation,
a
day
of
darkness
and
gloominess,
a
day
of
clouds
and
thick
darkness,
001:016
A
day
of
the
trumpet
and
alarm
against
the
fenced
cities,
and
against
the
high
towers.
001:017
And
I
will
bring
distress
upon
men,
that
they
shall
walk
like
blind
men,
because
they
have
sinned
against
the
LORD:
and
their
blood
shall
be
poured
out
as
dust,
and
their
flesh
as
the
dung.
001:018
Neither
their
silver
nor
their
gold
shall
be
able
to
deliver
them
in
the
day
of
the
LORD's
wrath;
but
the
whole
land
shall
be
devoured
by
the
fire
of
his
jealousy:
for
he
shall
make
even
a
speedy
riddance
of
all
them
that
dwell
in
the
land.
002:001
Gather
yourselves
together,
yea,
gather
together,
O
nation
not
desired;
002:002
Before
the
decree
bring
forth,
before
the
day
pass
as
the
chaff,
before
the
fierce
anger
of
the
LORD
come
upon
you,
before
the
day
of
the
LORD's
anger
come
upon
you.
002:003
Seek
ye
the
LORD,
all
ye
meek
of
the
earth,
which
have
wrought
his
judgment;
seek
righteousness,
seek
meekness:
it
may
be
ye
shall
be
hid
in
the
day
of
the
LORD's
anger.
002:004
For
Gaza
shall
be
forsaken,
and
Ashkelon
a
desolation:
they
shall
drive
out
Ashdod
at
the
noon
day,
and
Ekron
shall
be
rooted
up.
002:005
Woe
unto
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
coast,
the
nation
of
the
Cherethites!
the
word
of
the
LORD
is
against
you;
O
Canaan,
the
land
of
the
Philistines,
I
will
even
destroy
thee,
that
there
shall
be
no
inhabitant.
002:006
And
the
sea
coast
shall
be
dwellings
and
cottages
for
shepherds,
and
folds
for
flocks.
002:007
And
the
coast
shall
be
for
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Judah;
they
shall
feed
thereupon:
in
the
houses
of
Ashkelon
shall
they
lie
down
in
the
evening:
for
the
LORD
their
God
shall
visit
them,
and
turn
away
their
captivity.
002:008
I
have
heard
the
reproach
of
Moab,
and
the
revilings
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
whereby
they
have
reproached
my
people,
and
magnified
themselves
against
their
border.
002:009
Therefore
as
I
live,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
Israel,
Surely
Moab
shall
be
as
Sodom,
and
the
children
of
Ammon
as
Gomorrah,
even
the
breeding
of
nettles,
and
saltpits,
and
a
perpetual
desolation:
the
residue
of
my
people
shall
spoil
them,
and
the
remnant
of
my
people
shall
possess
them.
002:010
This
shall
they
have
for
their
pride,
because
they
have
reproached
and
magnified
themselves
against
the
people
of
the
LORD
of
hosts.
002:011
The
LORD
will
be
terrible
unto
them:
for
he
will
famish
all
the
gods
of
the
earth;
and
men
shall
worship
him,
every
one
from
his
place,
even
all
the
isles
of
the
heathen.
002:012
Ye
Ethiopians
also,
ye
shall
be
slain
by
my
sword.
002:013
And
he
will
stretch
out
his
hand
against
the
north,
and
destroy
Assyria;
and
will
make
Nineveh
a
desolation,
and
dry
like
a
wilderness.
002:014
And
flocks
shall
lie
down
in
the
midst
of
her,
all
the
beasts
of
the
nations:
both
the
cormorant
and
the
bittern
shall
lodge
in
the
upper
lintels
of
it;
their
voice
shall
sing
in
the
windows;
desolation
shall
be
in
the
thresholds;
for
he
shall
uncover
the
cedar
work.
002:015
This
is
the
rejoicing
city
that
dwelt
carelessly,
that
said
in
her
heart,
I
am,
and
there
is
none
beside
me:
how
is
she
become
a
desolation,
a
place
for
beasts
to
lie
down
in!
every
one
that
passeth
by
her
shall
hiss,
and
wag
his
hand.
003:001
Woe
to
her
that
is
filthy
and
polluted,
to
the
oppressing
city!
003:002
She
obeyed
not
the
voice;
she
received
not
correction;
she
trusted
not
in
the
LORD;
she
drew
not
near
to
her
God.
003:003
Her
princes
within
her
are
roaring
lions;
her
judges
are
evening
wolves;
they
gnaw
not
the
bones
till
the
morrow.
003:004
Her
prophets
are
light
and
treacherous
persons:
her
priests
have
polluted
the
sanctuary,
they
have
done
violence
to
the
law.
003:005
The
just
LORD
is
in
the
midst
thereof;
he
will
not
do
iniquity:
every
morning
doth
he
bring
his
judgment
to
light,
he
faileth
not;
but
the
unjust
knoweth
no
shame.
003:006
I
have
cut
off
the
nations:
their
towers
are
desolate;
I
made
their
streets
waste,
that
none
passeth
by:
their
cities
are
destroyed,
so
that
there
is
no
man,
that
there
is
none
inhabitant.
003:007
I
said,
Surely
thou
wilt
fear
me,
thou
wilt
receive
instruction;
so
their
dwelling
should
not
be
cut
off,
howsoever
I
punished
them:
but
they
rose
early,
and
corrupted
all
their
doings.
003:008
Therefore
wait
ye
upon
me,
saith
the
LORD,
until
the
day
that
I
rise
up
to
