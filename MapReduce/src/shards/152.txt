the
prey:
for
my
determination
is
to
gather
the
nations,
that
I
may
assemble
the
kingdoms,
to
pour
upon
them
mine
indignation,
even
all
my
fierce
anger:
for
all
the
earth
shall
be
devoured
with
the
fire
of
my
jealousy.
003:009
For
then
will
I
turn
to
the
people
a
pure
language,
that
they
may
all
call
upon
the
name
of
the
LORD,
to
serve
him
with
one
consent.
003:010
From
beyond
the
rivers
of
Ethiopia
my
suppliants,
even
the
daughter
of
my
dispersed,
shall
bring
mine
offering.
003:011
In
that
day
shalt
thou
not
be
ashamed
for
all
thy
doings,
wherein
thou
hast
transgressed
against
me:
for
then
I
will
take
away
out
of
the
midst
of
thee
them
that
rejoice
in
thy
pride,
and
thou
shalt
no
more
be
haughty
because
of
my
holy
mountain.
003:012
I
will
also
leave
in
the
midst
of
thee
an
afflicted
and
poor
people,
and
they
shall
trust
in
the
name
of
the
LORD.
003:013
The
remnant
of
Israel
shall
not
do
iniquity,
nor
speak
lies;
neither
shall
a
deceitful
tongue
be
found
in
their
mouth:
for
they
shall
feed
and
lie
down,
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid.
003:014
Sing,
O
daughter
of
Zion;
shout,
O
Israel;
be
glad
and
rejoice
with
all
the
heart,
O
daughter
of
Jerusalem.
003:015
The
LORD
hath
taken
away
thy
judgments,
he
hath
cast
out
thine
enemy:
the
king
of
Israel,
even
the
LORD,
is
in
the
midst
of
thee:
thou
shalt
not
see
evil
any
more.
003:016
In
that
day
it
shall
be
said
to
Jerusalem,
Fear
thou
not:
and
to
Zion,
Let
not
thine
hands
be
slack.
003:017
The
LORD
thy
God
in
the
midst
of
thee
is
mighty;
he
will
save,
he
will
rejoice
over
thee
with
joy;
he
will
rest
in
his
love,
he
will
joy
over
thee
with
singing.
003:018
I
will
gather
them
that
are
sorrowful
for
the
solemn
assembly,
who
are
of
thee,
to
whom
the
reproach
of
it
was
a
burden.
003:019
Behold,
at
that
time
I
will
undo
all
that
afflict
thee:
and
I
will
save
her
that
halteth,
and
gather
her
that
was
driven
out;
and
I
will
get
them
praise
and
fame
in
every
land
where
they
have
been
put
to
shame.
003:020
At
that
time
will
I
bring
you
again,
even
in
the
time
that
I
gather
you:
for
I
will
make
you
a
name
and
a
praise
among
all
people
of
the
earth,
when
I
turn
back
your
captivity
before
your
eyes,
saith
the
LORD.
Book
37	Haggai
001:001
In
the
second
year
of
Darius
the
king,
in
the
sixth
month,
in
the
first
day
of
the
month,
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
Haggai
the
prophet
unto
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel,
governor
of
Judah,
and
to
Joshua
the
son
of
Josedech,
the
high
priest,
saying,
001:002
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
of
hosts,
saying,
This
people
say,
The
time
is
not
come,
the
time
that
the
LORD's
house
should
be
built.
001:003
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
Haggai
the
prophet,
saying,
001:004
Is
it
time
for
you,
O
ye,
to
dwell
in
your
cieled
houses,
and
this
house
lie
waste?
001:005
Now
therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Consider
your
ways.
001:006
Ye
have
sown
much,
and
bring
in
little;
ye
eat,
but
ye
have
not
enough;
ye
drink,
but
ye
are
not
filled
with
drink;
ye
clothe
you,
but
there
is
none
warm;
and
he
that
earneth
wages
earneth
wages
to
put
it
into
a
bag
with
holes.
001:007
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Consider
your
ways.
001:008
Go
up
to
the
mountain,
and
bring
wood,
and
build
the
house;
and
I
will
take
pleasure
in
it,
and
I
will
be
glorified,
saith
the
LORD.
001:009
Ye
looked
for
much,
and,
lo
it
came
to
little;
and
when
ye
brought
it
home,
I
did
blow
upon
it.
Why?
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
Because
of
mine
house
that
is
waste,
and
ye
run
every
man
unto
his
own
house.
001:010
Therefore
the
heaven
over
you
is
stayed
from
dew,
and
the
earth
is
stayed
from
her
fruit.
001:011
And
I
called
for
a
drought
upon
the
land,
and
upon
the
mountains,
and
upon
the
corn,
and
upon
the
new
wine,
and
upon
the
oil,
and
upon
that
which
the
ground
bringeth
forth,
and
upon
men,
and
upon
cattle,
and
upon
all
the
labour
of
the
hands.
001:012
Then
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel,
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Josedech,
the
high
priest,
with
all
the
remnant
of
the
people,
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
LORD
their
God,
and
the
words
of
Haggai
the
prophet,
as
the
LORD
their
God
had
sent
him,
and
the
people
did
fear
before
the
LORD.
001:013
Then
spake
Haggai
the
LORD's
messenger
in
the
LORD's
message
unto
the
people,
saying,
I
am
with
you,
saith
the
LORD.
001:014
And
the
LORD
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel,
governor
of
Judah,
and
the
spirit
of
Joshua
the
son
of
Josedech,
the
high
priest,
and
the
spirit
of
all
the
remnant
of
the
people;
and
they
came
and
did
work
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
their
God,
001:015
In
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
sixth
month,
in
the
second
year
of
Darius
the
king.
002:001
In
the
seventh
month,
in
the
one
and
twentieth
day
of
the
month,
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
the
prophet
Haggai,
saying,
002:002
Speak
now
to
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel,
governor
of
Judah,
and
to
Joshua
the
son
of
Josedech,
the
high
priest,
and
to
the
residue
of
the
people,
saying,
002:003
Who
is
left
among
you
that
saw
this
house
in
her
first
glory?
and
how
do
ye
see
it
now?
is
it
not
in
your
eyes
in
comparison
of
it
as
nothing?
002:004
Yet
now
be
strong,
O
Zerubbabel,
saith
the
LORD;
and
be
strong,
O
Joshua,
son
of
Josedech,
the
high
priest;
and
be
strong,
all
ye
people
of
the
land,
saith
the
LORD,
and
work:
for
I
am
with
you,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts:
002:005
According
to
the
word
that
I
covenanted
with
you
when
ye
came
out
of
Egypt,
so
my
spirit
remaineth
among
you:
fear
ye
not.
002:006
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Yet
once,
it
is
a
little
while,
and
I
will
shake
the
heavens,
and
the
earth,
and
the
sea,
and
the
dry
land;
002:007
And
I
will
shake
all
nations,
and
the
desire
of
all
nations
shall
come:
and
I
will
fill
this
house
with
glory,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
002:008
The
silver
is
mine,
and
the
gold
is
mine,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
002:009
The
glory
of
this
latter
house
shall
be
greater
than
of
the
former,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts:
and
in
this
place
will
I
give
peace,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
002:010
In
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
ninth
month,
in
the
second
year
of
Darius,
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
Haggai
the
prophet,
saying,
002:011
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Ask
now
the
priests
concerning
the
law,
saying,
002:012
If
one
bear
holy
flesh
in
the
skirt
of
his
garment,
and
with
his
skirt
do
touch
bread,
or
pottage,
or
wine,
or
oil,
or
any
meat,
shall
it
be
holy?
And
the
priests
answered
and
said,
No.
002:013
Then
said
Haggai,
If
one
that
is
unclean
by
a
dead
body
touch
any
of
these,
shall
it
be
unclean?
And
the
priests
answered
and
said,
It
shall
be
unclean.
002:014
Then
answered
Haggai,
and
said,
So
is
this
people,
and
so
is
this
nation
before
me,
saith
the
LORD;
and
so
is
every
work
of
their
hands;
and
that
which
they
offer
there
is
unclean.
002:015
And
now,
I
pray
you,
consider
from
this
day
and
upward,
from
before
a
stone
was
laid
upon
a
stone
in
the
temple
of
the
LORD:
002:016
Since
those
days
were,
when
one
came
to
an
heap
of
twenty
measures,
there
were
but
ten:
when
one
came
to
the
pressfat
for
to
draw
out
fifty
vessels
out
of
the
press,
there
were
but
twenty.
002:017
I
smote
you
with
blasting
and
with
mildew
and
with
hail
in
all
the
labours
of
your
hands;
yet
ye
turned
not
to
me,
saith
the
LORD.
002:018
Consider
now
from
this
day
and
upward,
from
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
ninth
month,
even
from
the
day
that
the
foundation
of
the
LORD's
temple
was
laid,
consider
it.
002:019
Is
the
seed
yet
in
the
barn?
yea,
as
yet
the
vine,
and
the
fig
tree,
and
the
pomegranate,
and
the
olive
tree,
hath
not
brought
forth:
from
this
day
will
I
bless
you.
002:020
And
again
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Haggai
in
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
month,
saying,
002:021
Speak
to
Zerubbabel,
governor
of
Judah,
saying,
I
will
shake
the
heavens
and
the
earth;
002:022
And
I
will
overthrow
the
throne
of
kingdoms,
and
I
will
destroy
the
strength
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
heathen;
and
I
will
overthrow
the
chariots,
and
those
that
ride
in
them;
and
the
horses
and
their
riders
shall
come
down,
every
one
by
the
sword
of
his
brother.
002:023
In
that
day,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
will
I
take
thee,
O
Zerubbabel,
my
servant,
the
son
of
Shealtiel,
saith
the
LORD,
and
will
make
thee
as
a
signet:
for
I
have
chosen
thee,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
Book
38	Zechariah
001:001
In
the
eighth
month,
in
the
second
year
of
Darius,
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Zechariah,
the
son
of
Berechiah,
the
son
of
Iddo
the
prophet,
saying,
001:002
The
LORD
hath
been
sore
displeased
with
your
fathers.
001:003
Therefore
say
thou
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Turn
ye
unto
me,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
I
will
turn
unto
you,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
001:004
Be
ye
not
as
your
fathers,
unto
whom
the
former
prophets
have
cried,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Turn
ye
now
from
your
evil
ways,
and
from
your
evil
doings:
but
they
did
not
hear,
nor
hearken
unto
me,
saith
the
LORD.
001:005
Your
fathers,
where
are
they?
and
the
prophets,
do
they
live
for
ever?
001:006
But
my
words
and
my
statutes,
which
I
commanded
my
servants
the
prophets,
did
they
not
take
hold
of
your
fathers?
and
they
returned
and
said,
Like
as
the
LORD
of
hosts
thought
to
do
unto
us,
according
to
our
ways,
and
according
to
our
doings,
so
hath
he
dealt
with
us.
001:007
Upon
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
eleventh
month,
which
is
the
month
Sebat,
in
the
second
year
of
Darius,
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Zechariah,
the
son
of
Berechiah,
the
son
of
Iddo
the
prophet,
saying,
001:008
I
saw
by
night,
and
behold
a
man
riding
upon
a
red
horse,
and
he
stood
among
the
myrtle
trees
that
were
in
the
bottom;
and
behind
him
were
there
red
horses,
speckled,
and
white.
001:009
Then
said
I,
O
my
lord,
what
are
these?
And
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
said
unto
me,
I
will
shew
thee
what
these
be.
001:010
And
the
man
that
stood
among
the
myrtle
trees
answered
and
said,
These
are
they
whom
the
LORD
hath
sent
to
walk
to
and
fro
through
the
earth.
001:011
And
they
answered
the
angel
of
the
LORD
that
stood
among
the
myrtle
trees,
and
said,
We
have
walked
to
and
fro
through
the
earth,
and,
behold,
all
the
earth
sitteth
still,
and
is
at
rest.
001:012
Then
the
angel
of
the
LORD
answered
and
said,
O
LORD
of
hosts,
how
long
wilt
thou
not
have
mercy
on
Jerusalem
and
on
the
cities
of
Judah,
against
which
thou
hast
had
indignation
these
threescore
and
ten
years?
001:013
And
the
LORD
answered
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
with
good
words
and
comfortable
words.
001:014
So
the
angel
that
communed
with
me
said
unto
me,
Cry
thou,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
I
am
jealous
for
Jerusalem
and
for
Zion
with
a
great
jealousy.
001:015
And
I
am
very
sore
displeased
with
the
heathen
that
are
at
ease:
for
I
was
but
a
little
displeased,
and
they
helped
forward
the
affliction.
001:016
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD;
I
am
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
mercies:
my
house
shall
be
built
in
it,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
a
line
shall
be
stretched
forth
upon
Jerusalem.
001:017
Cry
yet,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
My
cities
through
prosperity
shall
yet
be
spread
abroad;
and
the
LORD
shall
yet
comfort
Zion,
and
shall
yet
choose
Jerusalem.
001:018
Then
lifted
I
up
mine
eyes,
and
saw,
and
behold
four
horns.
001:019
And
I
said
unto
the
angel
that
talked
with
me,
What
be
these?
And
he
answered
me,
These
are
the
horns
which
have
scattered
Judah,
Israel,
and
Jerusalem.
001:020
And
the
LORD
shewed
me
four
carpenters.
001:021
Then
said
I,
What
come
these
to
do?
And
he
spake,
saying,
These
are
the
horns
which
have
scattered
Judah,
so
that
no
man
did
lift
up
his
head:
but
these
are
come
to
fray
them,
to
cast
out
the
horns
of
the
Gentiles,
which
lifted
up
their
horn
over
the
land
of
Judah
to
scatter
it.
002:001
I
lifted
up
mine
eyes
again,
and
looked,
and
behold
a
man
with
a
measuring
line
in
his
hand.
002:002
Then
said
I,
Whither
goest
thou?
And
he
said
unto
me,
To
measure
Jerusalem,
to
see
what
is
the
breadth
thereof,
and
what
is
the
length
thereof.
002:003
And,
behold,
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
went
forth,
and
another
angel
went
out
to
meet
him,
002:004
And
said
unto
him,
Run,
speak
to
this
young
man,
saying,
Jerusalem
shall
be
inhabited
as
towns
without
walls
for
the
multitude
of
men
and
cattle
therein:
002:005
For
I,
saith
the
LORD,
will
be
unto
her
a
wall
of
fire
round
about,
and
will
be
the
glory
in
the
midst
of
her.
002:006
Ho,
ho,
come
forth,
and
flee
from
the
land
of
the
north,
saith
the
LORD:
for
I
have
spread
you
abroad
as
the
four
winds
of
the
heaven,
saith
the
LORD.
002:007
Deliver
thyself,
O
Zion,
that
dwellest
with
the
daughter
of
Babylon.
002:008
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
After
the
glory
hath
he
sent
me
unto
the
nations
which
spoiled
you:
for
he
that
toucheth
you
toucheth
the
apple
of
his
eye.
002:009
For,
behold,
I
will
shake
mine
hand
upon
them,
and
they
shall
be
a
spoil
to
their
servants:
and
ye
shall
know
that
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sent
me.
002:010
Sing
and
rejoice,
O
daughter
of
Zion:
for,
lo,
I
come,
and
I
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
thee,
saith
the
LORD.
002:011
And
many
nations
shall
be
joined
to
the
LORD
in
that
day,
and
shall
be
my
people:
and
I
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
thee,
and
thou
shalt
know
that
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sent
me
unto
thee.
002:012
And
the
LORD
shall
inherit
Judah
his
portion
in
the
holy
land,
and
shall
choose
Jerusalem
again.
002:013
Be
silent,
O
all
flesh,
before
the
LORD:
for
he
is
raised
up
out
of
his
holy
habitation.
003:001
And
he
shewed
me
Joshua
the
high
priest
standing
before
the
angel
of
the
LORD,
and
Satan
standing
at
his
right
hand
to
resist
him.
003:002
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Satan,
The
LORD
rebuke
thee,
O
Satan;
even
the
LORD
that
hath
chosen
Jerusalem
rebuke
thee:
is
not
this
a
brand
plucked
out
of
the
fire?
003:003
Now
Joshua
was
clothed
with
filthy
garments,
and
stood
before
the
angel.
003:004
And
he
answered
and
spake
unto
those
that
stood
before
him,
saying,
Take
away
the
filthy
garments
from
him.
And
unto
him
he
said,
Behold,
I
have
caused
thine
iniquity
to
pass
from
thee,
and
I
will
clothe
thee
with
change
of
raiment.
003:005
And
I
said,
Let
them
set
a
fair
mitre
upon
his
head.
So
they
set
a
fair
mitre
upon
his
head,
and
clothed
him
with
garments.
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
stood
by.
003:006
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
protested
unto
Joshua,
saying,
003:007
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
If
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
ways,
and
if
thou
wilt
keep
my
charge,
then
thou
shalt
also
judge
my
house,
and
shalt
also
keep
my
courts,
and
I
will
give
thee
places
to
walk
among
these
that
stand
by.
003:008
Hear
now,
O
Joshua
the
high
priest,
thou,
and
thy
fellows
that
sit
before
thee:
for
they
are
men
wondered
at:
for,
behold,
I
will
bring
forth
my
servant
the
BRANCH.
003:009
For
behold
the
stone
that
I
have
laid
before
Joshua;
upon
one
stone
shall
be
seven
eyes:
behold,
I
will
engrave
the
graving
thereof,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
I
will
remove
the
iniquity
of
that
land
in
one
day.
003:010
In
that
day,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
shall
ye
call
every
man
his
neighbour
under
the
vine
and
under
the
fig
tree.
004:001
And
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
came
again,
and
waked
me,
as
a
man
that
is
wakened
out
of
his
sleep.
004:002
And
said
unto
me,
What
seest
thou?
And
I
said,
I
have
looked,
and
behold
a
candlestick
all
of
gold,
with
a
bowl
upon
the
top
of
it,
and
his
seven
lamps
thereon,
and
seven
pipes
to
the
seven
lamps,
which
are
upon
the
top
thereof:
004:003
And
two
olive
trees
by
it,
one
upon
the
right
side
of
the
bowl,
and
the
other
upon
the
left
side
thereof.
004:004
So
I
answered
and
spake
to
the
angel
that
talked
with
me,
saying,
What
are
these,
my
lord?
004:005
Then
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
answered
and
said
unto
me,
Knowest
thou
not
what
these
be?
And
I
said,
No,
my
lord.
004:006
Then
he
answered
and
spake
unto
me,
saying,
This
is
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Zerubbabel,
saying,
Not
by
might,
nor
by
power,
but
by
my
spirit,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
004:007
Who
art
thou,
O
great
mountain?
before
Zerubbabel
thou
shalt
become
a
plain:
and
he
shall
bring
forth
the
headstone
thereof
with
shoutings,
crying,
Grace,
grace
unto
it.
004:008
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
004:009
The
hands
of
Zerubbabel
have
laid
the
foundation
of
this
house;
his
hands
shall
also
finish
it;
and
thou
shalt
know
that
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sent
me
unto
you.
004:010
For
who
hath
despised
the
day
of
small
things?
for
they
shall
rejoice,
and
shall
see
the
plummet
in
the
hand
of
Zerubbabel
with
those
seven;
they
are
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
which
run
to
and
fro
through
the
whole
earth.
004:011
Then
answered
I,
and
said
unto
him,
What
are
these
two
olive
trees
upon
the
right
side
of
the
candlestick
and
upon
the
left
side
thereof?
004:012
And
I
answered
again,
and
said
unto
him,
What
be
these
two
olive
branches
which
through
the
two
golden
pipes
empty
the
golden
oil
out
of
themselves?
004:013
And
he
answered
me
and
said,
Knowest
thou
not
what
these
be?
And
I
said,
No,
my
lord.
004:014
Then
said
he,
These
are
the
two
anointed
ones,
that
stand
by
the
LORD
of
the
whole
earth.
005:001
Then
I
turned,
and
lifted
up
mine
eyes,
and
looked,
and
behold
a
flying
roll.
005:002
And
he
said
unto
me,
What
seest
thou?
And
I
answered,
I
see
a
flying
roll;
the
length
thereof
is
twenty
cubits,
and
the
breadth
thereof
ten
cubits.
005:003
Then
said
he
unto
me,
This
is
the
curse
that
goeth
forth
over
the
face
of
the
whole
earth:
for
every
one
that
stealeth
shall
be
cut
off
as
on
this
side
according
to
it;
and
every
one
that
sweareth
shall
be
cut
off
as
on
that
side
according
to
it.
005:004
I
will
bring
it
forth,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
it
shall
enter
into
the
house
of
the
thief,
and
into
the
house
of
him
that
sweareth
falsely
by
my
name:
and
it
shall
remain
in
the
midst
of
his
house,
and
shall
consume
it
with
the
timber
thereof
and
the
stones
thereof.
005:005
Then
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
went
forth,
and
said
unto
me,
Lift
up
now
thine
eyes,
and
see
what
is
this
that
goeth
forth.
005:006
And
I
said,
What
is
it?
And
he
said,
This
is
an
ephah
that
goeth
forth.
He
said
moreover,
This
is
their
resemblance
through
all
the
earth.
005:007
And,
behold,
there
was
lifted
up
a
talent
of
lead:
and
this
is
a
woman
that
sitteth
in
the
midst
of
the
ephah.
005:008
And
he
said,
This
is
wickedness.
And
he
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
the
ephah;
and
he
cast
the
weight
of
lead
upon
the
mouth
thereof.
005:009
Then
lifted
I
up
mine
eyes,
and
looked,
and,
behold,
there
came
out
two
women,
and
the
wind
was
in
their
wings;
for
they
had
wings
like
the
wings
of
a
stork:
and
they
lifted
up
the
ephah
between
the
earth
and
the
heaven.
005:010
Then
said
I
to
the
angel
that
talked
with
me,
Whither
do
these
bear
the
ephah?
005:011
And
he
said
unto
me,
To
build
it
an
house
in
the
land
of
Shinar:
and
it
shall
be
established,
and
set
there
upon
her
own
base.
006:001
And
I
turned,
and
lifted
up
mine
eyes,
and
looked,
and,
behold,
there
came
four
chariots
out
from
between
two
mountains;
and
the
mountains
were
mountains
of
brass.
006:002
In
the
first
chariot
were
red
horses;
and
in
the
second
chariot
black
horses;
006:003
And
in
the
third
chariot
white
horses;
and
in
the
fourth
chariot
grisled
and
bay
horses.
006:004
Then
I
answered
and
said
unto
the
angel
that
talked
with
me,
What
are
these,
my
lord?
006:005
And
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
me,
These
are
the
four
spirits
of
the
heavens,
which
go
forth
from
standing
before
the
LORD
of
all
the
earth.
006:006
The
black
horses
which
are
therein
go
forth
into
the
north
country;
and
the
white
go
forth
after
them;
and
the
grisled
go
forth
toward
the
south
country.
006:007
And
the
bay
went
forth,
and
sought
to
go
that
they
might
walk
to
and
fro
through
the
earth:
and
he
said,
Get
you
hence,
walk
to
and
fro
through
the
earth.
So
they
walked
to
and
fro
through
the
earth.
006:008
Then
cried
he
upon
me,
and
spake
unto
me,
saying,
Behold,
these
that
go
toward
the
north
country
have
quieted
my
spirit
in
the
north
country.
006:009
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me,
saying,
006:010
Take
of
them
of
the
captivity,
even
of
Heldai,
of
Tobijah,
and
of
Jedaiah,
which
are
come
from
Babylon,
and
come
thou
the
same
day,
and
go
into
the
house
of
Josiah
the
son
of
Zephaniah;
006:011
Then
take
silver
and
gold,
and
make
crowns,
and
set
them
upon
the
head
of
Joshua
the
son
of
Josedech,
the
high
priest;
006:012
And
speak
unto
him,
saying,
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
of
hosts,
saying,
Behold
the
man
whose
name
is
The
BRANCH;
and
he
shall
grow
up
out
of
his
place,
and
he
shall
build
the
temple
of
the
LORD:
006:013
Even
he
shall
build
the
temple
of
the
LORD;
and
he
shall
bear
the
glory,
and
shall
sit
and
rule
upon
his
throne;
and
he
shall
be
a
priest
upon
his
throne:
and
the
counsel
of
peace
shall
be
between
them
both.
006:014
And
the
crowns
shall
be
to
Helem,
and
to
Tobijah,
and
to
Jedaiah,
and
to
Hen
the
son
of
Zephaniah,
for
a
memorial
in
the
temple
of
the
LORD.
006:015
And
they
that
are
far
off
shall
come
and
build
in
the
temple
of
the
LORD,
and
ye
shall
know
that
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sent
me
unto
you.
And
this
shall
come
to
pass,
if
ye
will
diligently
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD
your
God.
007:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
king
Darius,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Zechariah
in
the
fourth
day
of
the
ninth
month,
even
in
Chisleu;
007:002
When
they
had
sent
unto
the
house
of
God
Sherezer
and
Regemmelech,
and
their
men,
to
pray
before
the
LORD,
007:003
