And
to
speak
unto
the
priests
which
were
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
to
the
prophets,
saying,
Should
I
weep
in
the
fifth
month,
separating
myself,
as
I
have
done
these
so
many
years?
007:004
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
unto
me,
saying,
007:005
Speak
unto
all
the
people
of
the
land,
and
to
the
priests,
saying,
When
ye
fasted
and
mourned
in
the
fifth
and
seventh
month,
even
those
seventy
years,
did
ye
at
all
fast
unto
me,
even
to
me?
007:006
And
when
ye
did
eat,
and
when
ye
did
drink,
did
not
ye
eat
for
yourselves,
and
drink
for
yourselves?
007:007
Should
ye
not
hear
the
words
which
the
LORD
hath
cried
by
the
former
prophets,
when
Jerusalem
was
inhabited
and
in
prosperity,
and
the
cities
thereof
round
about
her,
when
men
inhabited
the
south
and
the
plain?
007:008
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Zechariah,
saying,
007:009
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
of
hosts,
saying,
Execute
true
judgment,
and
shew
mercy
and
compassions
every
man
to
his
brother:
007:010
And
oppress
not
the
widow,
nor
the
fatherless,
the
stranger,
nor
the
poor;
and
let
none
of
you
imagine
evil
against
his
brother
in
your
heart.
007:011
But
they
refused
to
hearken,
and
pulled
away
the
shoulder,
and
stopped
their
ears,
that
they
should
not
hear.
007:012
Yea,
they
made
their
hearts
as
an
adamant
stone,
lest
they
should
hear
the
law,
and
the
words
which
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sent
in
his
spirit
by
the
former
prophets:
therefore
came
a
great
wrath
from
the
LORD
of
hosts.
007:013
Therefore
it
is
come
to
pass,
that
as
he
cried,
and
they
would
not
hear;
so
they
cried,
and
I
would
not
hear,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts:
007:014
But
I
scattered
them
with
a
whirlwind
among
all
the
nations
whom
they
knew
not.
Thus
the
land
was
desolate
after
them,
that
no
man
passed
through
nor
returned:
for
they
laid
the
pleasant
land
desolate.
008:001
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
came
to
me,
saying,
008:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
I
was
jealous
for
Zion
with
great
jealousy,
and
I
was
jealous
for
her
with
great
fury.
008:003
Thus
saith
the
LORD;
I
am
returned
unto
Zion,
and
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
Jerusalem:
and
Jerusalem
shall
be
called
a
city
of
truth;
and
the
mountain
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
the
holy
mountain.
008:004
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
There
shall
yet
old
men
and
old
women
dwell
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem,
and
every
man
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
for
very
age.
008:005
And
the
streets
of
the
city
shall
be
full
of
boys
and
girls
playing
in
the
streets
thereof.
008:006
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
If
it
be
marvellous
in
the
eyes
of
the
remnant
of
this
people
in
these
days,
should
it
also
be
marvellous
in
mine
eyes?
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
008:007
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Behold,
I
will
save
my
people
from
the
east
country,
and
from
the
west
country;
008:008
And
I
will
bring
them,
and
they
shall
dwell
in
the
midst
of
Jerusalem:
and
they
shall
be
my
people,
and
I
will
be
their
God,
in
truth
and
in
righteousness.
008:009
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
Let
your
hands
be
strong,
ye
that
hear
in
these
days
these
words
by
the
mouth
of
the
prophets,
which
were
in
the
day
that
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
was
laid,
that
the
temple
might
be
built.
008:010
For
before
these
days
there
was
no
hire
for
man,
nor
any
hire
for
beast;
neither
was
there
any
peace
to
him
that
went
out
or
came
in
because
of
the
affliction:
for
I
set
all
men
every
one
against
his
neighbour.
008:011
But
now
I
will
not
be
unto
the
residue
of
this
people
as
in
the
former
days,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
008:012
For
the
seed
shall
be
prosperous;
the
vine
shall
give
her
fruit,
and
the
ground
shall
give
her
increase,
and
the
heavens
shall
give
their
dew;
and
I
will
cause
the
remnant
of
this
people
to
possess
all
these
things.
008:013
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
as
ye
were
a
curse
among
the
heathen,
O
house
of
Judah,
and
house
of
Israel;
so
will
I
save
you,
and
ye
shall
be
a
blessing:
fear
not,
but
let
your
hands
be
strong.
008:014
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
As
I
thought
to
punish
you,
when
your
fathers
provoked
me
to
wrath,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
I
repented
not:
008:015
So
again
have
I
thought
in
these
days
to
do
well
unto
Jerusalem
and
to
the
house
of
Judah:
fear
ye
not.
008:016
These
are
the
things
that
ye
shall
do;
Speak
ye
every
man
the
truth
to
his
neighbour;
execute
the
judgment
of
truth
and
peace
in
your
gates:
008:017
And
let
none
of
you
imagine
evil
in
your
hearts
against
his
neighbour;
and
love
no
false
oath:
for
all
these
are
things
that
I
hate,
saith
the
LORD.
008:018
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
came
unto
me,
saying,
008:019
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
The
fast
of
the
fourth
month,
and
the
fast
of
the
fifth,
and
the
fast
of
the
seventh,
and
the
fast
of
the
tenth,
shall
be
to
the
house
of
Judah
joy
and
gladness,
and
cheerful
feasts;
therefore
love
the
truth
and
peace.
008:020
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
It
shall
yet
come
to
pass,
that
there
shall
come
people,
and
the
inhabitants
of
many
cities:
008:021
And
the
inhabitants
of
one
city
shall
go
to
another,
saying,
Let
us
go
speedily
to
pray
before
the
LORD,
and
to
seek
the
LORD
of
hosts:
I
will
go
also.
008:022
Yea,
many
people
and
strong
nations
shall
come
to
seek
the
LORD
of
hosts
in
Jerusalem,
and
to
pray
before
the
LORD.
008:023
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
In
those
days
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
ten
men
shall
take
hold
out
of
all
languages
of
the
nations,
even
shall
take
hold
of
the
skirt
of
him
that
is
a
Jew,
saying,
We
will
go
with
you:
for
we
have
heard
that
God
is
with
you.
009:001
The
burden
of
the
word
of
the
LORD
in
the
land
of
Hadrach,
and
Damascus
shall
be
the
rest
thereof:
when
the
eyes
of
man,
as
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
shall
be
toward
the
LORD.
009:002
And
Hamath
also
shall
border
thereby;
Tyrus,
and
Zidon,
though
it
be
very
wise.
009:003
And
Tyrus
did
build
herself
a
strong
hold,
and
heaped
up
silver
as
the
dust,
and
fine
gold
as
the
mire
of
the
streets.
009:004
Behold,
the
LORD
will
cast
her
out,
and
he
will
smite
her
power
in
the
sea;
and
she
shall
be
devoured
with
fire.
009:005
Ashkelon
shall
see
it,
and
fear;
Gaza
also
shall
see
it,
and
be
very
sorrowful,
and
Ekron;
for
her
expectation
shall
be
ashamed;
and
the
king
shall
perish
from
Gaza,
and
Ashkelon
shall
not
be
inhabited.
009:006
And
a
bastard
shall
dwell
in
Ashdod,
and
I
will
cut
off
the
pride
of
the
Philistines.
009:007
And
I
will
take
away
his
blood
out
of
his
mouth,
and
his
abominations
from
between
his
teeth:
but
he
that
remaineth,
even
he,
shall
be
for
our
God,
and
he
shall
be
as
a
governor
in
Judah,
and
Ekron
as
a
Jebusite.
009:008
And
I
will
encamp
about
mine
house
because
of
the
army,
because
of
him
that
passeth
by,
and
because
of
him
that
returneth:
and
no
oppressor
shall
pass
through
them
any
more:
for
now
have
I
seen
with
mine
eyes.
009:009
Rejoice
greatly,
O
daughter
of
Zion;
shout,
O
daughter
of
Jerusalem:
behold,
thy
King
cometh
unto
thee:
he
is
just,
and
having
salvation;
lowly,
and
riding
upon
an
ass,
and
upon
a
colt
the
foal
of
an
ass.
009:010
And
I
will
cut
off
the
chariot
from
Ephraim,
and
the
horse
from
Jerusalem,
and
the
battle
bow
shall
be
cut
off:
and
he
shall
speak
peace
unto
the
heathen:
and
his
dominion
shall
be
from
sea
even
to
sea,
and
from
the
river
even
to
the
ends
of
the
earth.
009:011
As
for
thee
also,
by
the
blood
of
thy
covenant
I
have
sent
forth
thy
prisoners
out
of
the
pit
wherein
is
no
water.
009:012
Turn
you
to
the
strong
hold,
ye
prisoners
of
hope:
even
to
day
do
I
declare
that
I
will
render
double
unto
thee;
009:013
When
I
have
bent
Judah
for
me,
filled
the
bow
with
Ephraim,
and
raised
up
thy
sons,
O
Zion,
against
thy
sons,
O
Greece,
and
made
thee
as
the
sword
of
a
mighty
man.
009:014
And
the
LORD
shall
be
seen
over
them,
and
his
arrow
shall
go
forth
as
the
lightning:
and
the
LORD
God
shall
blow
the
trumpet,
and
shall
go
with
whirlwinds
of
the
south.
009:015
The
LORD
of
hosts
shall
defend
them;
and
they
shall
devour,
and
subdue
with
sling
stones;
and
they
shall
drink,
and
make
a
noise
as
through
wine;
and
they
shall
be
filled
like
bowls,
and
as
the
corners
of
the
altar.
009:016
And
the
LORD
their
God
shall
save
them
in
that
day
as
the
flock
of
his
people:
for
they
shall
be
as
the
stones
of
a
crown,
lifted
up
as
an
ensign
upon
his
land.
009:017
For
how
great
is
his
goodness,
and
how
great
is
his
beauty!
corn
shall
make
the
young
men
cheerful,
and
new
wine
the
maids.
010:001
Ask
ye
of
the
LORD
rain
in
the
time
of
the
latter
rain;
so
the
LORD
shall
make
bright
clouds,
and
give
them
showers
of
rain,
to
every
one
grass
in
the
field.
010:002
For
the
idols
have
spoken
vanity,
and
the
diviners
have
seen
a
lie,
and
have
told
false
dreams;
they
comfort
in
vain:
therefore
they
went
their
way
as
a
flock,
they
were
troubled,
because
there
was
no
shepherd.
010:003
Mine
anger
was
kindled
against
the
shepherds,
and
I
punished
the
goats:
for
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
visited
his
flock
the
house
of
Judah,
and
hath
made
them
as
his
goodly
horse
in
the
battle.
010:004
Out
of
him
came
forth
the
corner,
out
of
him
the
nail,
out
of
him
the
battle
bow,
out
of
him
every
oppressor
together.
010:005
And
they
shall
be
as
mighty
men,
which
tread
down
their
enemies
in
the
mire
of
the
streets
in
the
battle:
and
they
shall
fight,
because
the
LORD
is
with
them,
and
the
riders
on
horses
shall
be
confounded.
010:006
And
I
will
strengthen
the
house
of
Judah,
and
I
will
save
the
house
of
Joseph,
and
I
will
bring
them
again
to
place
them;
for
I
have
mercy
upon
them:
and
they
shall
be
as
though
I
had
not
cast
them
off:
for
I
am
the
LORD
their
God,
and
will
hear
them.
010:007
And
they
of
Ephraim
shall
be
like
a
mighty
man,
and
their
heart
shall
rejoice
as
through
wine:
yea,
their
children
shall
see
it,
and
be
glad;
their
heart
shall
rejoice
in
the
LORD.
010:008
I
will
hiss
for
them,
and
gather
them;
for
I
have
redeemed
them:
and
they
shall
increase
as
they
have
increased.
010:009
And
I
will
sow
them
among
the
people:
and
they
shall
remember
me
in
far
countries;
and
they
shall
live
with
their
children,
and
turn
again.
010:010
I
will
bring
them
again
also
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
gather
them
out
of
Assyria;
and
I
will
bring
them
into
the
land
of
Gilead
and
Lebanon;
and
place
shall
not
be
found
for
them.
010:011
And
he
shall
pass
through
the
sea
with
affliction,
and
shall
smite
the
waves
in
the
sea,
and
all
the
deeps
of
the
river
shall
dry
up:
and
the
pride
of
Assyria
shall
be
brought
down,
and
the
sceptre
of
Egypt
shall
depart
away.
010:012
And
I
will
strengthen
them
in
the
LORD;
and
they
shall
walk
up
and
down
in
his
name,
saith
the
LORD.
011:001
Open
thy
doors,
O
Lebanon,
that
the
fire
may
devour
thy
cedars.
011:002
Howl,
fir
tree;
for
the
cedar
is
fallen;
because
the
mighty
are
spoiled:
howl,
O
ye
oaks
of
Bashan;
for
the
forest
of
the
vintage
is
come
down.
011:003
There
is
a
voice
of
the
howling
of
the
shepherds;
for
their
glory
is
spoiled:
a
voice
of
the
roaring
of
young
lions;
for
the
pride
of
Jordan
is
spoiled.
011:004
Thus
saith
the
LORD
my
God;
Feed
the
flock
of
the
slaughter;
011:005
Whose
possessors
slay
them,
and
hold
themselves
not
guilty:
and
they
that
sell
them
say,
Blessed
be
the
LORD;
for
I
am
rich:
and
their
own
shepherds
pity
them
not.
011:006
For
I
will
no
more
pity
the
inhabitants
of
the
land,
saith
the
LORD:
but,
lo,
I
will
deliver
the
men
every
one
into
his
neighbour's
hand,
and
into
the
hand
of
his
king:
and
they
shall
smite
the
land,
and
out
of
their
hand
I
will
not
deliver
them.
011:007
And
I
will
feed
the
flock
of
slaughter,
even
you,
O
poor
of
the
flock.
And
I
took
unto
me
two
staves;
the
one
I
called
Beauty,
and
the
other
I
called
Bands;
and
I
fed
the
flock.
011:008
Three
shepherds
also
I
cut
off
in
one
month;
and
my
soul
lothed
them,
and
their
soul
also
abhorred
me.
011:009
Then
said
I,
I
will
not
feed
you:
that
that
dieth,
let
it
die;
and
that
that
is
to
be
cut
off,
let
it
be
cut
off;
and
let
the
rest
eat
every
one
the
flesh
of
another.
011:010
And
I
took
my
staff,
even
Beauty,
and
cut
it
asunder,
that
I
might
break
my
covenant
which
I
had
made
with
all
the
people.
011:011
And
it
was
broken
in
that
day:
and
so
the
poor
of
the
flock
that
waited
upon
me
knew
that
it
was
the
word
of
the
LORD.
011:012
And
I
said
unto
them,
If
ye
think
good,
give
me
my
price;
and
if
not,
forbear.
So
they
weighed
for
my
price
thirty
pieces
of
silver.
011:013
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Cast
it
unto
the
potter:
a
goodly
price
that
I
was
prised
at
of
them.
And
I
took
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver,
and
cast
them
to
the
potter
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
011:014
Then
I
cut
asunder
mine
other
staff,
even
Bands,
that
I
might
break
the
brotherhood
between
Judah
and
Israel.
011:015
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Take
unto
thee
yet
the
instruments
of
a
foolish
shepherd.
011:016
For,
lo,
I
will
raise
up
a
shepherd
in
the
land,
which
shall
not
visit
those
that
be
cut
off,
neither
shall
seek
the
young
one,
nor
heal
that
that
is
broken,
nor
feed
that
that
standeth
still:
but
he
shall
eat
the
flesh
of
the
fat,
and
tear
their
claws
in
pieces.
011:017
Woe
to
the
idol
shepherd
that
leaveth
the
flock!
the
sword
shall
be
upon
his
arm,
and
upon
his
right
eye:
his
arm
shall
be
clean
dried
up,
and
his
right
eye
shall
be
utterly
darkened.
012:001
The
burden
of
the
word
of
the
LORD
for
Israel,
saith
the
LORD,
which
stretcheth
forth
the
heavens,
and
layeth
the
foundation
of
the
earth,
and
formeth
the
spirit
of
man
within
him.
012:002
Behold,
I
will
make
Jerusalem
a
cup
of
trembling
unto
all
the
people
round
about,
when
they
shall
be
in
the
siege
both
against
Judah
and
against
Jerusalem.
012:003
And
in
that
day
will
I
make
Jerusalem
a
burdensome
stone
for
all
people:
all
that
burden
themselves
with
it
shall
be
cut
in
pieces,
though
all
the
people
of
the
earth
be
gathered
together
against
it.
012:004
In
that
day,
saith
the
LORD,
I
will
smite
every
horse
with
astonishment,
and
his
rider
with
madness:
and
I
will
open
mine
eyes
upon
the
house
of
Judah,
and
will
smite
every
horse
of
the
people
with
blindness.
012:005
And
the
governors
of
Judah
shall
say
in
their
heart,
The
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
shall
be
my
strength
in
the
LORD
of
hosts
their
God.
012:006
In
that
day
will
I
make
the
governors
of
Judah
like
an
hearth
of
fire
among
the
wood,
and
like
a
torch
of
fire
in
a
sheaf;
and
they
shall
devour
all
the
people
round
about,
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left:
and
Jerusalem
shall
be
inhabited
again
in
her
own
place,
even
in
Jerusalem.
012:007
The
LORD
also
shall
save
the
tents
of
Judah
first,
that
the
glory
of
the
house
of
David
and
the
glory
of
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
do
not
magnify
themselves
against
Judah.
012:008
In
that
day
shall
the
LORD
defend
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem;
and
he
that
is
feeble
among
them
at
that
day
shall
be
as
David;
and
the
house
of
David
shall
be
as
God,
as
the
angel
of
the
LORD
before
them.
012:009
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
I
will
seek
to
destroy
all
the
nations
that
come
against
Jerusalem.
012:010
And
I
will
pour
upon
the
house
of
David,
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
the
spirit
of
grace
and
of
supplications:
and
they
shall
look
upon
me
whom
they
have
pierced,
and
they
shall
mourn
for
him,
as
one
mourneth
for
his
only
son,
and
shall
be
in
bitterness
for
him,
as
one
that
is
in
bitterness
for
his
firstborn.
012:011
In
that
day
shall
there
be
a
great
mourning
in
Jerusalem,
as
the
mourning
of
Hadadrimmon
in
the
valley
of
Megiddon.
012:012
And
the
land
shall
mourn,
every
family
apart;
the
family
of
the
house
of
David
apart,
and
their
wives
apart;
the
family
of
the
house
of
Nathan
apart,
and
their
wives
apart;
012:013
The
family
of
the
house
of
Levi
apart,
and
their
wives
apart;
the
family
of
Shimei
apart,
and
their
wives
apart;
012:014
All
the
families
that
remain,
every
family
apart,
and
their
wives
apart.
013:001
In
that
day
there
shall
be
a
fountain
opened
to
the
house
of
David
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
for
sin
and
for
uncleanness.
013:002
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
that
I
will
cut
off
the
names
of
the
idols
out
of
the
land,
and
they
shall
no
more
be
remembered:
and
also
I
will
cause
the
prophets
and
the
unclean
spirit
to
pass
out
of
the
land.
013:003
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
when
any
shall
yet
prophesy,
then
his
father
and
his
mother
that
begat
him
shall
say
unto
him,
Thou
shalt
not
live;
for
thou
speakest
lies
in
the
name
of
the
LORD:
and
his
father
and
his
mother
that
begat
him
shall
thrust
him
through
when
he
prophesieth.
013:004
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
the
prophets
shall
be
ashamed
every
one
of
his
vision,
when
he
hath
prophesied;
neither
shall
they
wear
a
rough
garment
to
deceive:
013:005
But
he
shall
say,
I
am
no
prophet,
I
am
an
husbandman;
for
man
taught
me
to
keep
cattle
from
my
youth.
013:006
And
one
shall
say
unto
him,
What
are
these
wounds
in
thine
hands?
Then
he
shall
answer,
Those
with
which
I
was
wounded
in
the
house
of
my
friends.
013:007
Awake,
O
sword,
against
my
shepherd,
and
against
the
man
that
is
my
fellow,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts:
smite
the
shepherd,
and
the
sheep
shall
be
scattered:
and
I
will
turn
mine
hand
upon
the
little
ones.
013:008
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
in
all
the
land,
saith
the
LORD,
two
parts
therein
shall
be
cut
off
and
die;
but
the
third
shall
be
left
therein.
013:009
And
I
will
bring
the
third
part
through
the
fire,
and
will
refine
them
as
silver
is
refined,
and
will
try
them
as
gold
is
tried:
they
shall
call
on
my
name,
and
I
will
hear
them:
I
will
say,
It
is
my
people:
and
they
shall
say,
The
LORD
is
my
God.
014:001
Behold,
the
day
of
the
LORD
cometh,
and
thy
spoil
shall
be
divided
in
the
midst
of
thee.
014:002
For
I
will
gather
all
nations
against
Jerusalem
to
battle;
and
the
city
shall
be
taken,
and
the
houses
rifled,
and
the
women
ravished;
and
half
of
the
city
shall
go
forth
into
captivity,
and
the
residue
of
the
people
shall
not
be
cut
off
from
the
city.
014:003
Then
shall
the
LORD
go
forth,
and
fight
against
those
nations,
as
when
he
fought
in
the
day
of
battle.
014:004
And
his
feet
shall
stand
in
that
day
upon
the
mount
of
Olives,
which
is
before
Jerusalem
on
the
east,
and
the
mount
of
Olives
shall
cleave
in
the
midst
thereof
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
west,
and
there
shall
be
a
very
great
valley;
and
half
of
the
mountain
shall
remove
toward
the
north,
and
half
of
it
toward
the
south.
014:005
And
ye
shall
flee
to
the
valley
of
the
mountains;
for
the
valley
of
the
mountains
shall
reach
unto
Azal:
yea,
ye
shall
flee,
like
as
ye
fled
from
before
the
earthquake
in
the
days
of
Uzziah
king
of
Judah:
and
the
LORD
my
God
shall
come,
and
all
the
saints
with
thee.
014:006
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
the
light
shall
not
be
clear,
nor
dark:
014:007
But
it
shall
be
one
day
which
shall
be
known
to
the
LORD,
not
day,
nor
night:
but
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
at
evening
time
it
shall
be
light.
014:008
And
it
shall
be
in
that
day,
that
living
waters
shall
go
out
from
Jerusalem;
half
of
them
toward
the
former
sea,
and
half
of
them
toward
the
hinder
sea:
in
summer
and
in
winter
shall
it
be.
014:009
And
the
LORD
shall
be
king
over
all
the
earth:
in
that
day
shall
there
be
one
LORD,
and
his
name
one.
014:010
All
the
land
shall
be
turned
as
a
plain
from
Geba
to
Rimmon
south
of
Jerusalem:
and
it
shall
be
lifted
up,
and
inhabited
in
her
place,
from
Benjamin's
gate
unto
the
place
of
the
first
gate,
unto
the
corner
gate,
and
from
the
tower
of
Hananeel
unto
the
king's
winepresses.
014:011
And
men
shall
dwell
in
it,
and
there
shall
be
no
more
utter
destruction;
but
Jerusalem
shall
be
safely
inhabited.
014:012
And
this
shall
be
the
plague
wherewith
the
LORD
will
smite
all
the
people
that
have
fought
against
Jerusalem;
Their
flesh
shall
consume
away
while
they
stand
upon
their
feet,
and
their
eyes
shall
consume
away
in
their
holes,
and
their
tongue
shall
consume
away
in
their
mouth.
014:013
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day,
that
a
great
tumult
from
the
LORD
shall
be
among
them;
and
they
shall
lay
hold
every
one
on
the
hand
of
his
neighbour,
and
his
hand
shall
rise
up
against
the
hand
of
his
neighbour.
014:014
And
Judah
also
shall
fight
at
Jerusalem;
and
the
wealth
of
all
the
heathen
round
about
shall
be
gathered
together,
gold,
and
silver,
and
apparel,
in
great
abundance.
014:015
And
so
shall
be
the
plague
of
the
horse,
of
the
mule,
of
the
camel,
and
of
the
ass,
and
of
all
the
beasts
that
shall
be
in
these
tents,
as
this
plague.
014:016
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
every
one
that
is
left
of
all
the
nations
which
came
against
Jerusalem
shall
even
go
up
from
year
to
year
to
worship
the
King,
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
to
keep
the
feast
of
tabernacles.
014:017
And
it
shall
be,
that
whoso
will
not
come
up
of
all
the
families
of
the
earth
unto
Jerusalem
to
worship
the
King,
the
LORD
of
hosts,
even
upon
them
shall
be
no
rain.
014:018
And
if
the
family
of
Egypt
go
not
up,
and
come
not,
that
have
no
rain;
there
shall
be
the
plague,
wherewith
the
LORD
will
smite
the
heathen
that
come
not
up
to
keep
the
feast
of
tabernacles.
014:019
This
shall
be
the
punishment
of
Egypt,
and
the
punishment
of
all
nations
that
come
not
up
to
keep
the
feast
of
tabernacles.
014:020
In
that
day
shall
there
be
upon
the
bells
of
the
horses,
HOLINESS
UNTO
THE
LORD;
and
the
pots
in
the
LORD's
house
shall
