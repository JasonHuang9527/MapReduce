be
like
the
bowls
before
the
altar.
014:021
Yea,
every
pot
in
Jerusalem
and
in
Judah
shall
be
holiness
unto
the
LORD
of
hosts:
and
all
they
that
sacrifice
shall
come
and
take
of
them,
and
seethe
therein:
and
in
that
day
there
shall
be
no
more
the
Canaanite
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
of
hosts.
Book
39	Malachi
001:001
The
burden
of
the
word
of
the
LORD
to
Israel
by
Malachi.
001:002
I
have
loved
you,
saith
the
LORD.
Yet
ye
say,
Wherein
hast
thou
loved
us?
Was
not
Esau
Jacob's
brother?
saith
the
LORD:
yet
I
loved
Jacob,
001:003
And
I
hated
Esau,
and
laid
his
mountains
and
his
heritage
waste
for
the
dragons
of
the
wilderness.
001:004
Whereas
Edom
saith,
We
are
impoverished,
but
we
will
return
and
build
the
desolate
places;
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
They
shall
build,
but
I
will
throw
down;
and
they
shall
call
them,
The
border
of
wickedness,
and,
The
people
against
whom
the
LORD
hath
indignation
for
ever.
001:005
And
your
eyes
shall
see,
and
ye
shall
say,
The
LORD
will
be
magnified
from
the
border
of
Israel.
001:006
A
son
honoureth
his
father,
and
a
servant
his
master:
if
then
I
be
a
father,
where
is
mine
honour?
and
if
I
be
a
master,
where
is
my
fear?
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts
unto
you,
O
priests,
that
despise
my
name.
And
ye
say,
Wherein
have
we
despised
thy
name?
001:007
Ye
offer
polluted
bread
upon
mine
altar;
and
ye
say,
Wherein
have
we
polluted
thee?
In
that
ye
say,
The
table
of
the
LORD
is
contemptible.
001:008
And
if
ye
offer
the
blind
for
sacrifice,
is
it
not
evil?
and
if
ye
offer
the
lame
and
sick,
is
it
not
evil?
offer
it
now
unto
thy
governor;
will
he
be
pleased
with
thee,
or
accept
thy
person?
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
001:009
And
now,
I
pray
you,
beseech
God
that
he
will
be
gracious
unto
us:
this
hath
been
by
your
means:
will
he
regard
your
persons?
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
001:010
Who
is
there
even
among
you
that
would
shut
the
doors
for
nought?
neither
do
ye
kindle
fire
on
mine
altar
for
nought.
I
have
no
pleasure
in
you,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
neither
will
I
accept
an
offering
at
your
hand.
001:011
For
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
even
unto
the
going
down
of
the
same
my
name
shall
be
great
among
the
Gentiles;
and
in
every
place
incense
shall
be
offered
unto
my
name,
and
a
pure
offering:
for
my
name
shall
be
great
among
the
heathen,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
001:012
But
ye
have
profaned
it,
in
that
ye
say,
The
table
of
the
LORD
is
polluted;
and
the
fruit
thereof,
even
his
meat,
is
contemptible.
001:013
Ye
said
also,
Behold,
what
a
weariness
is
it!
and
ye
have
snuffed
at
it,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts;
and
ye
brought
that
which
was
torn,
and
the
lame,
and
the
sick;
thus
ye
brought
an
offering:
should
I
accept
this
of
your
hand?
saith
the
LORD.
001:014
But
cursed
be
the
deceiver,
which
hath
in
his
flock
a
male,
and
voweth,
and
sacrificeth
unto
the
LORD
a
corrupt
thing:
for
I
am
a
great
King,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
and
my
name
is
dreadful
among
the
heathen.
002:001
And
now,
O
ye
priests,
this
commandment
is
for
you.
002:002
If
ye
will
not
hear,
and
if
ye
will
not
lay
it
to
heart,
to
give
glory
unto
my
name,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
I
will
even
send
a
curse
upon
you,
and
I
will
curse
your
blessings:
yea,
I
have
cursed
them
already,
because
ye
do
not
lay
it
to
heart.
002:003
Behold,
I
will
corrupt
your
seed,
and
spread
dung
upon
your
faces,
even
the
dung
of
your
solemn
feasts;
and
one
shall
take
you
away
with
it.
002:004
And
ye
shall
know
that
I
have
sent
this
commandment
unto
you,
that
my
covenant
might
be
with
Levi,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
002:005
My
covenant
was
with
him
of
life
and
peace;
and
I
gave
them
to
him
for
the
fear
wherewith
he
feared
me,
and
was
afraid
before
my
name.
002:006
The
law
of
truth
was
in
his
mouth,
and
iniquity
was
not
found
in
his
lips:
he
walked
with
me
in
peace
and
equity,
and
did
turn
many
away
from
iniquity.
002:007
For
the
priest's
lips
should
keep
knowledge,
and
they
should
seek
the
law
at
his
mouth:
for
he
is
the
messenger
of
the
LORD
of
hosts.
002:008
But
ye
are
departed
out
of
the
way;
ye
have
caused
many
to
stumble
at
the
law;
ye
have
corrupted
the
covenant
of
Levi,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
002:009
Therefore
have
I
also
made
you
contemptible
and
base
before
all
the
people,
according
as
ye
have
not
kept
my
ways,
but
have
been
partial
in
the
law.
002:010
Have
we
not
all
one
father?
hath
not
one
God
created
us?
why
do
we
deal
treacherously
every
man
against
his
brother,
by
profaning
the
covenant
of
our
fathers?
002:011
Judah
hath
dealt
treacherously,
and
an
abomination
is
committed
in
Israel
and
in
Jerusalem;
for
Judah
hath
profaned
the
holiness
of
the
LORD
which
he
loved,
and
hath
married
the
daughter
of
a
strange
god.
002:012
The
LORD
will
cut
off
the
man
that
doeth
this,
the
master
and
the
scholar,
out
of
the
tabernacles
of
Jacob,
and
him
that
offereth
an
offering
unto
the
LORD
of
hosts.
002:013
And
this
have
ye
done
again,
covering
the
altar
of
the
LORD
with
tears,
with
weeping,
and
with
crying
out,
insomuch
that
he
regardeth
not
the
offering
any
more,
or
receiveth
it
with
good
will
at
your
hand.
002:014
Yet
ye
say,
Wherefore?
Because
the
LORD
hath
been
witness
between
thee
and
the
wife
of
thy
youth,
against
whom
thou
hast
dealt
treacherously:
yet
is
she
thy
companion,
and
the
wife
of
thy
covenant.
002:015
And
did
not
he
make
one?
Yet
had
he
the
residue
of
the
spirit.
And
wherefore
one?
That
he
might
seek
a
godly
seed.
Therefore
take
heed
to
your
spirit,
and
let
none
deal
treacherously
against
the
wife
of
his
youth.
002:016
For
the
LORD,
the
God
of
Israel,
saith
that
he
hateth
putting
away:
for
one
covereth
violence
with
his
garment,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts:
therefore
take
heed
to
your
spirit,
that
ye
deal
not
treacherously.
002:017
Ye
have
wearied
the
LORD
with
your
words.
Yet
ye
say,
Wherein
have
we
wearied
him?
When
ye
say,
Every
one
that
doeth
evil
is
good
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
he
delighteth
in
them;
or,
Where
is
the
God
of
judgment?
003:001
Behold,
I
will
send
my
messenger,
and
he
shall
prepare
the
way
before
me:
and
the
LORD,
whom
ye
seek,
shall
suddenly
come
to
his
temple,
even
the
messenger
of
the
covenant,
whom
ye
delight
in:
behold,
he
shall
come,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
003:002
But
who
may
abide
the
day
of
his
coming?
and
who
shall
stand
when
he
appeareth?
for
he
is
like
a
refiner's
fire,
and
like
fullers'
soap:
003:003
And
he
shall
sit
as
a
refiner
and
purifier
of
silver:
and
he
shall
purify
the
sons
of
Levi,
and
purge
them
as
gold
and
silver,
that
they
may
offer
unto
the
LORD
an
offering
in
righteousness.
003:004
Then
shall
the
offering
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
be
pleasant
unto
the
LORD,
as
in
the
days
of
old,
and
as
in
former
years.
003:005
And
I
will
come
near
to
you
to
judgment;
and
I
will
be
a
swift
witness
against
the
sorcerers,
and
against
the
adulterers,
and
against
false
swearers,
and
against
those
that
oppress
the
hireling
in
his
wages,
the
widow,
and
the
fatherless,
and
that
turn
aside
the
stranger
from
his
right,
and
fear
not
me,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
003:006
For
I
am
the
LORD,
I
change
not;
therefore
ye
sons
of
Jacob
are
not
consumed.
003:007
Even
from
the
days
of
your
fathers
ye
are
gone
away
from
mine
ordinances,
and
have
not
kept
them.
Return
unto
me,
and
I
will
return
unto
you,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
But
ye
said,
Wherein
shall
we
return?
003:008
Will
a
man
rob
God?
Yet
ye
have
robbed
me.
But
ye
say,
Wherein
have
we
robbed
thee?
In
tithes
and
offerings.
003:009
Ye
are
cursed
with
a
curse:
for
ye
have
robbed
me,
even
this
whole
nation.
003:010
Bring
ye
all
the
tithes
into
the
storehouse,
that
there
may
be
meat
in
mine
house,
and
prove
me
now
herewith,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
if
I
will
not
open
you
the
windows
of
heaven,
and
pour
you
out
a
blessing,
that
there
shall
not
be
room
enough
to
receive
it.
003:011
And
I
will
rebuke
the
devourer
for
your
sakes,
and
he
shall
not
destroy
the
fruits
of
your
ground;
neither
shall
your
vine
cast
her
fruit
before
the
time
in
the
field,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
003:012
And
all
nations
shall
call
you
blessed:
for
ye
shall
be
a
delightsome
land,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
003:013
Your
words
have
been
stout
against
me,
saith
the
LORD.
Yet
ye
say,
What
have
we
spoken
so
much
against
thee?
003:014
Ye
have
said,
It
is
vain
to
serve
God:
and
what
profit
is
it
that
we
have
kept
his
ordinance,
and
that
we
have
walked
mournfully
before
the
LORD
of
hosts?
003:015
And
now
we
call
the
proud
happy;
yea,
they
that
work
wickedness
are
set
up;
yea,
they
that
tempt
God
are
even
delivered.
003:016
Then
they
that
feared
the
LORD
spake
often
one
to
another:
and
the
LORD
hearkened,
and
heard
it,
and
a
book
of
remembrance
was
written
before
him
for
them
that
feared
the
LORD,
and
that
thought
upon
his
name.
003:017
And
they
shall
be
mine,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
in
that
day
when
I
make
up
my
jewels;
and
I
will
spare
them,
as
a
man
spareth
his
own
son
that
serveth
him.
003:018
Then
shall
ye
return,
and
discern
between
the
righteous
and
the
wicked,
between
him
that
serveth
God
and
him
that
serveth
him
not.
004:001
For,
behold,
the
day
cometh,
that
shall
burn
as
an
oven;
and
all
the
proud,
yea,
and
all
that
do
wickedly,
shall
be
stubble:
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
up,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
that
it
shall
leave
them
neither
root
nor
branch.
004:002
But
unto
you
that
fear
my
name
shall
the
Sun
of
righteousness
arise
with
healing
in
his
wings;
and
ye
shall
go
forth,
and
grow
up
as
calves
of
the
stall.
004:003
And
ye
shall
tread
down
the
wicked;
for
they
shall
be
ashes
under
the
soles
of
your
feet
in
the
day
that
I
shall
do
this,
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts.
004:004
Remember
ye
the
law
of
Moses
my
servant,
which
I
commanded
unto
him
in
Horeb
for
all
Israel,
with
the
statutes
and
judgments.
004:005
Behold,
I
will
send
you
Elijah
the
prophet
before
the
coming
of
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
LORD:
004:006
And
he
shall
turn
the
heart
of
the
fathers
to
the
children,
and
the
heart
of
the
children
to
their
fathers,
lest
I
come
and
smite
the
earth
with
a
curse.
Book
40	Matthew
001:001
The
book
of
the
generation
of
Jesus
Christ,
the
son
of
David,
the
son
of
Abraham.
001:002
Abraham
begat
Isaac;
and
Isaac
begat
Jacob;
and
Jacob
begat
Judas
and
his
brethren;
001:003
And
Judas
begat
Phares
and
Zara
of
Thamar;
and
Phares
begat
Esrom;
and
Esrom
begat
Aram;
001:004
And
Aram
begat
Aminadab;
and
Aminadab
begat
Naasson;
and
Naasson
begat
Salmon;
001:005
And
Salmon
begat
Booz
of
Rachab;
and
Booz
begat
Obed
of
Ruth;
and
Obed
begat
Jesse;
001:006
And
Jesse
begat
David
the
king;
and
David
the
king
begat
Solomon
of
her
that
had
been
the
wife
of
Urias;
001:007
And
Solomon
begat
Roboam;
and
Roboam
begat
Abia;
and
Abia
begat
Asa;
001:008
And
Asa
begat
Josaphat;
and
Josaphat
begat
Joram;
and
Joram
begat
Ozias;
001:009
And
Ozias
begat
Joatham;
and
Joatham
begat
Achaz;
and
Achaz
begat
Ezekias;
001:010
And
Ezekias
begat
Manasses;
and
Manasses
begat
Amon;
and
Amon
begat
Josias;
001:011
And
Josias
begat
Jechonias
and
his
brethren,
about
the
time
they
were
carried
away
to
Babylon:
001:012
And
after
they
were
brought
to
Babylon,
Jechonias
begat
Salathiel;
and
Salathiel
begat
Zorobabel;
001:013
And
Zorobabel
begat
Abiud;
and
Abiud
begat
Eliakim;
and
Eliakim
begat
Azor;
001:014
And
Azor
begat
Sadoc;
and
Sadoc
begat
Achim;
and
Achim
begat
Eliud;
001:015
And
Eliud
begat
Eleazar;
and
Eleazar
begat
Matthan;
and
Matthan
begat
Jacob;
001:016
And
Jacob
begat
Joseph
the
husband
of
Mary,
of
whom
was
born
Jesus,
who
is
called
Christ.
001:017
So
all
the
generations
from
Abraham
to
David
are
fourteen
generations;
and
from
David
until
the
carrying
away
into
Babylon
are
fourteen
generations;
and
from
the
carrying
away
into
Babylon
unto
Christ
are
fourteen
generations.
001:018
Now
the
birth
of
Jesus
Christ
was
on
this
wise:
When
as
his
mother
Mary
was
espoused
to
Joseph,
before
they
came
together,
she
was
found
with
child
of
the
Holy
Ghost.
001:019
Then
Joseph
her
husband,
being
a
just
man,
and
not
willing
to
make
her
a
publick
example,
was
minded
to
put
her
away
privily.
001:020
But
while
he
thought
on
these
things,
behold,
the
angel
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him
in
a
dream,
saying,
Joseph,
thou
son
of
David,
fear
not
to
take
unto
thee
Mary
thy
wife:
for
that
which
is
conceived
in
her
is
of
the
Holy
Ghost.
001:021
And
she
shall
bring
forth
a
son,
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
JESUS:
for
he
shall
save
his
people
from
their
sins.
001:022
Now
all
this
was
done,
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
of
the
Lord
by
the
prophet,
saying,
001:023
Behold,
a
virgin
shall
be
with
child,
and
shall
bring
forth
a
son,
and
they
shall
call
his
name
Emmanuel,
which
being
interpreted
is,
God
with
us.
001:024
Then
Joseph
being
raised
from
sleep
did
as
the
angel
of
the
Lord
had
bidden
him,
and
took
unto
him
his
wife:
001:025
And
knew
her
not
till
she
had
brought
forth
her
firstborn
son:
and
he
called
his
name
JESUS.
002:001
Now
when
Jesus
was
born
in
Bethlehem
of
Judaea
in
the
days
of
Herod
the
king,
behold,
there
came
wise
men
from
the
east
to
Jerusalem,
002:002
Saying,
Where
is
he
that
is
born
King
of
the
Jews?
for
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east,
and
are
come
to
worship
him.
002:003
When
Herod
the
king
had
heard
these
things,
he
was
troubled,
and
all
Jerusalem
with
him.
002:004
And
when
he
had
gathered
all
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
of
the
people
together,
he
demanded
of
them
where
Christ
should
be
born.
002:005
And
they
said
unto
him,
In
Bethlehem
of
Judaea:
for
thus
it
is
written
by
the
prophet,
002:006
And
thou
Bethlehem,
in
the
land
of
Juda,
art
not
the
least
among
the
princes
of
Juda:
for
out
of
thee
shall
come
a
Governor,
that
shall
rule
my
people
Israel.
002:007
Then
Herod,
when
he
had
privily
called
the
wise
men,
enquired
of
them
diligently
what
time
the
star
appeared.
002:008
And
he
sent
them
to
Bethlehem,
and
said,
Go
and
search
diligently
for
the
young
child;
and
when
ye
have
found
him,
bring
me
word
again,
that
I
may
come
and
worship
him
also.
002:009
When
they
had
heard
the
king,
they
departed;
and,
lo,
the
star,
which
they
saw
in
the
east,
went
before
them,
till
it
came
and
stood
over
where
the
young
child
was.
002:010
When
they
saw
the
star,
they
rejoiced
with
exceeding
great
joy.
002:011
And
when
they
were
come
into
the
house,
they
saw
the
young
child
with
Mary
his
mother,
and
fell
down,
and
worshipped
him:
and
when
they
had
opened
their
treasures,
they
presented
unto
him
gifts;
gold,
and
frankincense
and
myrrh.
002:012
And
being
warned
of
God
in
a
dream
that
they
should
not
return
to
Herod,
they
departed
into
their
own
country
another
way.
002:013
And
when
they
were
departed,
behold,
the
angel
of
the
Lord
appeareth
to
Joseph
in
a
dream,
saying,
Arise,
and
take
the
young
child
and
his
mother,
and
flee
into
Egypt,
and
be
thou
there
until
I
bring
thee
word:
for
Herod
will
seek
the
young
child
to
destroy
him.
002:014
When
he
arose,
he
took
the
young
child
and
his
mother
by
night,
and
departed
into
Egypt:
002:015
And
was
there
until
the
death
of
Herod:
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
of
the
Lord
by
the
prophet,
saying,
Out
of
Egypt
have
I
called
my
son.
002:016
Then
Herod,
when
he
saw
that
he
was
mocked
of
the
wise
men,
was
exceeding
wroth,
and
sent
forth,
and
slew
all
the
children
that
were
in
Bethlehem,
and
in
all
the
coasts
thereof,
from
two
years
old
and
under,
according
to
the
time
which
he
had
diligently
enquired
of
the
wise
men.
002:017
Then
was
fulfilled
that
which
was
spoken
by
Jeremy
the
prophet,
saying,
002:018
In
Rama
was
there
a
voice
heard,
lamentation,
and
weeping,
and
great
mourning,
Rachel
weeping
for
her
children,
and
would
not
be
comforted,
because
they
are
not.
002:019
But
when
Herod
was
dead,
behold,
an
angel
of
the
Lord
appeareth
in
a
dream
to
Joseph
in
Egypt,
002:020
Saying,
Arise,
and
take
the
young
child
and
his
mother,
and
go
into
the
land
of
Israel:
for
they
are
dead
which
sought
the
young
child's
life.
002:021
And
he
arose,
and
took
the
young
child
and
his
mother,
and
came
into
the
land
of
Israel.
002:022
But
when
he
heard
that
Archelaus
did
reign
in
Judaea
in
the
room
of
his
father
Herod,
he
was
afraid
to
go
thither:
notwithstanding,
being
warned
of
God
in
a
dream,
he
turned
aside
into
the
parts
of
Galilee:
002:023
And
he
came
and
dwelt
in
a
city
called
Nazareth:
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophets,
He
shall
be
called
a
Nazarene.
003:001
In
those
days
came
John
the
Baptist,
preaching
in
the
wilderness
of
Judaea,
003:002
And
saying,
Repent
ye:
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand.
003:003
For
this
is
he
that
was
spoken
of
by
the
prophet
Esaias,
saying,
The
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness,
Prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
Lord,
make
his
paths
straight.
003:004
And
the
same
John
had
his
raiment
of
camel's
hair,
and
a
leathern
girdle
about
his
loins;
and
his
meat
was
locusts
and
wild
honey.
003:005
Then
went
out
to
him
Jerusalem,
and
all
Judaea,
and
all
the
region
round
about
Jordan,
003:006
And
were
baptized
of
him
in
Jordan,
confessing
their
sins.
003:007
But
when
he
saw
many
of
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
come
to
his
baptism,
he
said
unto
them,
O
generation
of
vipers,
who
hath
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come?
003:008
Bring
forth
therefore
fruits
meet
for
repentance:
003:009
And
think
not
to
say
within
yourselves,
We
have
Abraham
to
our
father:
for
I
say
unto
you,
that
God
is
able
of
these
stones
to
raise
up
children
unto
Abraham.
003:010
And
now
also
the
axe
is
laid
unto
the
root
of
the
trees:
therefore
every
tree
which
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down,
and
cast
into
the
fire.
003:011
I
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
unto
repentance:
but
he
that
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
I,
whose
shoes
I
am
not
worthy
to
bear:
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
Holy
Ghost,
and
with
fire:
003:012
Whose
fan
is
in
his
hand,
and
he
will
throughly
purge
his
floor,
and
gather
his
wheat
into
the
garner;
but
he
will
burn
up
the
chaff
with
unquenchable
fire.
003:013
Then
cometh
Jesus
from
Galilee
to
Jordan
unto
John,
to
be
baptized
of
him.
003:014
But
John
forbad
him,
saying,
I
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee,
and
comest
thou
to
me?
003:015
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
him,
Suffer
it
to
be
so
now:
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfil
all
righteousness.
Then
he
suffered
him.
003:016
And
Jesus,
when
he
was
baptized,
went
up
straightway
out
of
the
water:
and,
lo,
the
heavens
were
opened
unto
him,
and
he
saw
the
Spirit
of
God
descending
like
a
dove,
and
lighting
upon
him:
003:017
And
lo
a
voice
from
heaven,
saying,
This
is
my
beloved
Son,
in
whom
I
am
well
pleased.
004:001
Then
was
Jesus
led
up
of
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
of
the
devil.
004:002
And
when
he
had
fasted
forty
days
and
forty
nights,
he
was
afterward
an
hungred.
004:003
And
when
the
tempter
came
to
him,
he
said,
If
thou
be
the
Son
of
God,
command
that
these
stones
be
made
bread.
004:004
But
he
answered
and
said,
It
is
written,
Man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone,
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
God.
004:005
Then
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
the
holy
city,
and
setteth
him
on
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple,
004:006
And
saith
unto
him,
If
thou
be
the
Son
of
God,
cast
thyself
down:
for
it
is
written,
He
shall
give
his
angels
charge
concerning
thee:
and
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
thee
up,
lest
at
any
time
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone.
004:007
Jesus
said
unto
him,
It
is
written
again,
Thou
shalt
not
tempt
the
Lord
thy
God.
004:008
Again,
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain,
and
sheweth
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world,
and
the
glory
of
them;
004:009
And
saith
unto
him,
All
these
things
will
I
give
thee,
if
thou
wilt
fall
down
and
worship
me.
004:010
Then
saith
Jesus
unto
him,
Get
thee
hence,
Satan:
for
it
is
written,
Thou
shalt
worship
the
Lord
thy
God,
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve.
004:011
Then
the
devil
leaveth
him,
and,
behold,
angels
came
and
ministered
unto
him.
004:012
Now
when
Jesus
had
heard
that
John
was
cast
into
prison,
he
departed
into
Galilee;
004:013
And
leaving
Nazareth,
he
came
and
dwelt
in
Capernaum,
which
is
upon
the
sea
coast,
in
the
borders
of
Zabulon
and
Nephthalim:
004:014
That
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
Esaias
the
prophet,
saying,
004:015
The
land
of
Zabulon,
and
the
land
of
Nephthalim,
by
the
way
of
the
sea,
beyond
Jordan,
Galilee
of
the
Gentiles;
004:016
The
people
which
sat
in
darkness
saw
great
light;
and
to
them
which
sat
in
the
region
and
shadow
of
death
light
is
sprung
up.
004:017
From
that
time
Jesus
began
to
preach,
and
to
say,
Repent:
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand.
004:018
And
Jesus,
walking
by
the
sea
of
Galilee,
saw
two
brethren,
Simon
called
Peter,
and
Andrew
his
brother,
casting
a
net
into
the
sea:
for
they
were
fishers.
004:019
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Follow
me,
and
I
will
make
you
fishers
of
men.
004:020
And
they
straightway
left
their
nets,
and
followed
him.
004:021
And
going
on
from
thence,
he
saw
other
two
brethren,
James
the
son
of
Zebedee,
and
John
his
brother,
in
a
ship
with
Zebedee
their
father,
mending
their
nets;
and
he
called
them.
004:022
And
they
immediately
left
the
ship
and
their
father,
and
followed
him.
004:023
And
Jesus
went
about
all
Galilee,
teaching
in
their
synagogues,
and
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom,
and
healing
all
manner
of
sickness
and
all
manner
of
disease
among
the
people.
004:024
And
his
fame
went
throughout
all
Syria:
and
they
brought
unto
him
all
sick
people
that
were
taken
with
divers
diseases
and
torments,
and
those
which
were
possessed
with
devils,
and
those
which
were
lunatick,
and
those
that
had
the
palsy;
and
he
healed
them.
004:025
And
there
followed
him
great
multitudes
of
people
from
Galilee,
and
from
Decapolis,
and
from
Jerusalem,
and
from
Judaea,
and
from
beyond
Jordan.
005:001
And
seeing
the
multitudes,
he
went
up
into
a
mountain:
and
when
he
was
set,
his
disciples
came
unto
him:
005:002
And
he
opened
his
mouth,
and
taught
them,
saying,
005:003
Blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit:
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
005:004
Blessed
are
they
that
mourn:
for
they
shall
be
comforted.
005:005
Blessed
are
the
meek:
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth.
005:006
Blessed
are
they
which
do
