hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness:
for
they
shall
be
filled.
005:007
Blessed
are
the
merciful:
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy.
005:008
Blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart:
for
they
shall
see
God.
005:009
Blessed
are
the
peacemakers:
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
God.
005:010
Blessed
are
they
which
are
persecuted
for
righteousness'
sake:
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
005:011
Blessed
are
ye,
when
men
shall
revile
you,
and
persecute
you,
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely,
for
my
sake.
005:012
Rejoice,
and
be
exceeding
glad:
for
great
is
your
reward
in
heaven:
for
so
persecuted
they
the
prophets
which
were
before
you.
005:013
Ye
are
the
salt
of
the
earth:
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
savour,
wherewith
shall
it
be
salted?
it
is
thenceforth
good
for
nothing,
but
to
be
cast
out,
and
to
be
trodden
under
foot
of
men.
005:014
Ye
are
the
light
of
the
world.
A
city
that
is
set
on
an
hill
cannot
be
hid.
005:015
Neither
do
men
light
a
candle,
and
put
it
under
a
bushel,
but
on
a
candlestick;
and
it
giveth
light
unto
all
that
are
in
the
house.
005:016
Let
your
light
so
shine
before
men,
that
they
may
see
your
good
works,
and
glorify
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
005:017
Think
not
that
I
am
come
to
destroy
the
law,
or
the
prophets:
I
am
not
come
to
destroy,
but
to
fulfil.
005:018
For
verily
I
say
unto
you,
Till
heaven
and
earth
pass,
one
jot
or
one
tittle
shall
in
no
wise
pass
from
the
law,
till
all
be
fulfilled.
005:019
Whosoever
therefore
shall
break
one
of
these
least
commandments,
and
shall
teach
men
so,
he
shall
be
called
the
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven:
but
whosoever
shall
do
and
teach
them,
the
same
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
005:020
For
I
say
unto
you,
That
except
your
righteousness
shall
exceed
the
righteousness
of
the
scribes
and
Pharisees,
ye
shall
in
no
case
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
005:021
Ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
of
them
of
old
time,
Thou
shalt
not
kill;
and
whosoever
shall
kill
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
judgment:
005:022
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
whosoever
is
angry
with
his
brother
without
a
cause
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
judgment:
and
whosoever
shall
say
to
his
brother,
Raca,
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
council:
but
whosoever
shall
say,
Thou
fool,
shall
be
in
danger
of
hell
fire.
005:023
Therefore
if
thou
bring
thy
gift
to
the
altar,
and
there
rememberest
that
thy
brother
hath
ought
against
thee;
005:024
Leave
there
thy
gift
before
the
altar,
and
go
thy
way;
first
be
reconciled
to
thy
brother,
and
then
come
and
offer
thy
gift.
005:025
Agree
with
thine
adversary
quickly,
whiles
thou
art
in
the
way
with
him;
lest
at
any
time
the
adversary
deliver
thee
to
the
judge,
and
the
judge
deliver
thee
to
the
officer,
and
thou
be
cast
into
prison.
005:026
Verily
I
say
unto
thee,
Thou
shalt
by
no
means
come
out
thence,
till
thou
hast
paid
the
uttermost
farthing.
005:027
Ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
time,
Thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery:
005:028
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
whosoever
looketh
on
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
hath
committed
adultery
with
her
already
in
his
heart.
005:029
And
if
thy
right
eye
offend
thee,
pluck
it
out,
and
cast
it
from
thee:
for
it
is
profitable
for
thee
that
one
of
thy
members
should
perish,
and
not
that
thy
whole
body
should
be
cast
into
hell.
005:030
And
if
thy
right
hand
offend
thee,
cut
it
off,
and
cast
it
from
thee:
for
it
is
profitable
for
thee
that
one
of
thy
members
should
perish,
and
not
that
thy
whole
body
should
be
cast
into
hell.
005:031
It
hath
been
said,
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife,
let
him
give
her
a
writing
of
divorcement:
005:032
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife,
saving
for
the
cause
of
fornication,
causeth
her
to
commit
adultery:
and
whosoever
shall
marry
her
that
is
divorced
committeth
adultery.
005:033
Again,
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
by
them
of
old
time,
Thou
shalt
not
forswear
thyself,
but
shalt
perform
unto
the
Lord
thine
oaths:
005:034
But
I
say
unto
you,
Swear
not
at
all;
neither
by
heaven;
for
it
is
God's
throne:
005:035
Nor
by
the
earth;
for
it
is
his
footstool:
neither
by
Jerusalem;
for
it
is
the
city
of
the
great
King.
005:036
Neither
shalt
thou
swear
by
thy
head,
because
thou
canst
not
make
one
hair
white
or
black.
005:037
But
let
your
communication
be,
Yea,
yea;
Nay,
nay:
for
whatsoever
is
more
than
these
cometh
of
evil.
005:038
Ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said,
An
eye
for
an
eye,
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth:
005:039
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
ye
resist
not
evil:
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek,
turn
to
him
the
other
also.
005:040
And
if
any
man
will
sue
thee
at
the
law,
and
take
away
thy
coat,
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also.
005:041
And
whosoever
shall
compel
thee
to
go
a
mile,
go
with
him
twain.
005:042
Give
to
him
that
asketh
thee,
and
from
him
that
would
borrow
of
thee
turn
not
thou
away.
005:043
Ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said,
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour,
and
hate
thine
enemy.
005:044
But
I
say
unto
you,
Love
your
enemies,
bless
them
that
curse
you,
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you,
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you,
and
persecute
you;
005:045
That
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven:
for
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good,
and
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust.
005:046
For
if
ye
love
them
which
love
you,
what
reward
have
ye?
do
not
even
the
publicans
the
same?
005:047
And
if
ye
salute
your
brethren
only,
what
do
ye
more
than
others?
do
not
even
the
publicans
so?
005:048
Be
ye
therefore
perfect,
even
as
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven
is
perfect.
006:001
Take
heed
that
ye
do
not
your
alms
before
men,
to
be
seen
of
them:
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
006:002
Therefore
when
thou
doest
thine
alms,
do
not
sound
a
trumpet
before
thee,
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
streets,
that
they
may
have
glory
of
men.
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
They
have
their
reward.
006:003
But
when
thou
doest
alms,
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
doeth:
006:004
That
thine
alms
may
be
in
secret:
and
thy
Father
which
seeth
in
secret
himself
shall
reward
thee
openly.
006:005
And
when
thou
prayest,
thou
shalt
not
be
as
the
hypocrites
are:
for
they
love
to
pray
standing
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
corners
of
the
streets,
that
they
may
be
seen
of
men.
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
They
have
their
reward.
006:006
But
thou,
when
thou
prayest,
enter
into
thy
closet,
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
door,
pray
to
thy
Father
which
is
in
secret;
and
thy
Father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
openly.
006:007
But
when
ye
pray,
use
not
vain
repetitions,
as
the
heathen
do:
for
they
think
that
they
shall
be
heard
for
their
much
speaking.
006:008
Be
not
ye
therefore
like
unto
them:
for
your
Father
knoweth
what
things
ye
have
need
of,
before
ye
ask
him.
006:009
After
this
manner
therefore
pray
ye:
Our
Father
which
art
in
heaven,
Hallowed
be
thy
name.
006:010
Thy
kingdom
come,
Thy
will
be
done
in
earth,
as
it
is
in
heaven.
006:011
Give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread.
006:012
And
forgive
us
our
debts,
as
we
forgive
our
debtors.
006:013
And
lead
us
not
into
temptation,
but
deliver
us
from
evil:
For
thine
is
the
kingdom,
and
the
power,
and
the
glory,
for
ever.
Amen.
006:014
For
if
ye
forgive
men
their
trespasses,
your
heavenly
Father
will
also
forgive
you:
006:015
But
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses,
neither
will
your
Father
forgive
your
trespasses.
006:016
Moreover
when
ye
fast,
be
not,
as
the
hypocrites,
of
a
sad
countenance:
for
they
disfigure
their
faces,
that
they
may
appear
unto
men
to
fast.
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
They
have
their
reward.
006:017
But
thou,
when
thou
fastest,
anoint
thine
head,
and
wash
thy
face;
006:018
That
thou
appear
not
unto
men
to
fast,
but
unto
thy
Father
which
is
in
secret:
and
thy
Father,
which
seeth
in
secret,
shall
reward
thee
openly.
006:019
Lay
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
upon
earth,
where
moth
and
rust
doth
corrupt,
and
where
thieves
break
through
and
steal:
006:020
But
lay
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven,
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
corrupt,
and
where
thieves
do
not
break
through
nor
steal:
006:021
For
where
your
treasure
is,
there
will
your
heart
be
also.
006:022
The
light
of
the
body
is
the
eye:
if
therefore
thine
eye
be
single,
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
light.
006:023
But
if
thine
eye
be
evil,
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
darkness.
If
therefore
the
light
that
is
in
thee
be
darkness,
how
great
is
that
darkness!
006:024
No
man
can
serve
two
masters:
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one,
and
love
the
other;
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one,
and
despise
the
other.
Ye
cannot
serve
God
and
mammon.
006:025
Therefore
I
say
unto
you,
Take
no
thought
for
your
life,
what
ye
shall
eat,
or
what
ye
shall
drink;
nor
yet
for
your
body,
what
ye
shall
put
on.
Is
not
the
life
more
than
meat,
and
the
body
than
raiment?
006:026
Behold
the
fowls
of
the
air:
for
they
sow
not,
neither
do
they
reap,
nor
gather
into
barns;
yet
your
heavenly
Father
feedeth
them.
Are
ye
not
much
better
than
they?
006:027
Which
of
you
by
taking
thought
can
add
one
cubit
unto
his
stature?
006:028
And
why
take
ye
thought
for
raiment?
Consider
the
lilies
of
the
field,
how
they
grow;
they
toil
not,
neither
do
they
spin:
006:029
And
yet
I
say
unto
you,
That
even
Solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these.
006:030
Wherefore,
if
God
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field,
which
to
day
is,
and
to
morrow
is
cast
into
the
oven,
shall
he
not
much
more
clothe
you,
O
ye
of
little
faith?
006:031
Therefore
take
no
thought,
saying,
What
shall
we
eat?
or,
What
shall
we
drink?
or,
Wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothed?
006:032
(For
after
all
these
things
do
the
Gentiles
seek:)
for
your
heavenly
Father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
all
these
things.
006:033
But
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
God,
and
his
righteousness;
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you.
006:034
Take
therefore
no
thought
for
the
morrow:
for
the
morrow
shall
take
thought
for
the
things
of
itself.
Sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof.
007:001
Judge
not,
that
ye
be
not
judged.
007:002
For
with
what
judgment
ye
judge,
ye
shall
be
judged:
and
with
what
measure
ye
mete,
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again.
007:003
And
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brother's
eye,
but
considerest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye?
007:004
Or
how
wilt
thou
say
to
thy
brother,
Let
me
pull
out
the
mote
out
of
thine
eye;
and,
behold,
a
beam
is
in
thine
own
eye?
007:005
Thou
hypocrite,
first
cast
out
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye;
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
cast
out
the
mote
out
of
thy
brother's
eye.
007:006
Give
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
the
dogs,
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before
swine,
lest
they
trample
them
under
their
feet,
and
turn
again
and
rend
you.
007:007
Ask,
and
it
shall
be
given
you;
seek,
and
ye
shall
find;
knock,
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you:
007:008
For
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth;
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth;
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened.
007:009
Or
what
man
is
there
of
you,
whom
if
his
son
ask
bread,
will
he
give
him
a
stone?
007:010
Or
if
he
ask
a
fish,
will
he
give
him
a
serpent?
007:011
If
ye
then,
being
evil,
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children,
how
much
more
shall
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
him?
007:012
Therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you,
do
ye
even
so
to
them:
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets.
007:013
Enter
ye
in
at
the
strait
gate:
for
wide
is
the
gate,
and
broad
is
the
way,
that
leadeth
to
destruction,
and
many
there
be
which
go
in
thereat:
007:014
Because
strait
is
the
gate,
and
narrow
is
the
way,
which
leadeth
unto
life,
and
few
there
be
that
find
it.
007:015
Beware
of
false
prophets,
which
come
to
you
in
sheep's
clothing,
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves.
007:016
Ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits.
Do
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns,
or
figs
of
thistles?
007:017
Even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
fruit;
but
a
corrupt
tree
bringeth
forth
evil
fruit.
007:018
A
good
tree
cannot
bring
forth
evil
fruit,
neither
can
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
fruit.
007:019
Every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down,
and
cast
into
the
fire.
007:020
Wherefore
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them.
007:021
Not
every
one
that
saith
unto
me,
Lord,
Lord,
shall
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven;
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
007:022
Many
will
say
to
me
in
that
day,
Lord,
Lord,
have
we
not
prophesied
in
thy
name?
and
in
thy
name
have
cast
out
devils?
and
in
thy
name
done
many
wonderful
works?
007:023
And
then
will
I
profess
unto
them,
I
never
knew
you:
depart
from
me,
ye
that
work
iniquity.
007:024
Therefore
whosoever
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine,
and
doeth
them,
I
will
liken
him
unto
a
wise
man,
which
built
his
house
upon
a
rock:
007:025
And
the
rain
descended,
and
the
floods
came,
and
the
winds
blew,
and
beat
upon
that
house;
and
it
fell
not:
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock.
007:026
And
every
one
that
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine,
and
doeth
them
not,
shall
be
likened
unto
a
foolish
man,
which
built
his
house
upon
the
sand:
007:027
And
the
rain
descended,
and
the
floods
came,
and
the
winds
blew,
and
beat
upon
that
house;
and
it
fell:
and
great
was
the
fall
of
it.
007:028
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Jesus
had
ended
these
sayings,
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine:
007:029
For
he
taught
them
as
one
having
authority,
and
not
as
the
scribes.
008:001
When
he
was
come
down
from
the
mountain,
great
multitudes
followed
him.
008:002
And,
behold,
there
came
a
leper
and
worshipped
him,
saying,
Lord,
if
thou
wilt,
thou
canst
make
me
clean.
008:003
And
Jesus
put
forth
his
hand,
and
touched
him,
saying,
I
will;
be
thou
clean.
And
immediately
his
leprosy
was
cleansed.
008:004
And
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
See
thou
tell
no
man;
but
go
thy
way,
shew
thyself
to
the
priest,
and
offer
the
gift
that
Moses
commanded,
for
a
testimony
unto
them.
008:005
And
when
Jesus
was
entered
into
Capernaum,
there
came
unto
him
a
centurion,
beseeching
him,
008:006
And
saying,
Lord,
my
servant
lieth
at
home
sick
of
the
palsy,
grievously
tormented.
008:007
And
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
I
will
come
and
heal
him.
008:008
The
centurion
answered
and
said,
Lord,
I
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
come
under
my
roof:
but
speak
the
word
only,
and
my
servant
shall
be
healed.
008:009
For
I
am
a
man
under
authority,
having
soldiers
under
me:
and
I
say
to
this
man,
Go,
and
he
goeth;
and
to
another,
Come,
and
he
cometh;
and
to
my
servant,
Do
this,
and
he
doeth
it.
008:010
When
Jesus
heard
it,
he
marvelled,
and
said
to
them
that
followed,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
I
have
not
found
so
great
faith,
no,
not
in
Israel.
008:011
And
I
say
unto
you,
That
many
shall
come
from
the
east
and
west,
and
shall
sit
down
with
Abraham,
and
Isaac,
and
Jacob,
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
008:012
But
the
children
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
cast
out
into
outer
darkness:
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth.
008:013
And
Jesus
said
unto
the
centurion,
Go
thy
way;
and
as
thou
hast
believed,
so
be
it
done
unto
thee.
And
his
servant
was
healed
in
the
selfsame
hour.
008:014
And
when
Jesus
was
come
into
Peter's
house,
he
saw
his
wife's
mother
laid,
and
sick
of
a
fever.
008:015
And
he
touched
her
hand,
and
the
fever
left
her:
and
she
arose,
and
ministered
unto
them.
008:016
When
the
even
was
come,
they
brought
unto
him
many
that
were
possessed
with
devils:
and
he
cast
out
the
spirits
with
his
word,
and
healed
all
that
were
sick:
008:017
That
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
Esaias
the
prophet,
saying,
Himself
took
our
infirmities,
and
bare
our
sicknesses.
008:018
Now
when
Jesus
saw
great
multitudes
about
him,
he
gave
commandment
to
depart
unto
the
other
side.
008:019
And
a
certain
scribe
came,
and
said
unto
him,
Master,
I
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest.
008:020
And
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
The
foxes
have
holes,
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests;
but
the
Son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head.
008:021
And
another
of
his
disciples
said
unto
him,
Lord,
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
father.
008:022
But
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Follow
me;
and
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead.
008:023
And
when
he
was
entered
into
a
ship,
his
disciples
followed
him.
008:024
And,
behold,
there
arose
a
great
tempest
in
the
sea,
insomuch
that
the
ship
was
covered
with
the
waves:
but
he
was
asleep.
008:025
And
his
disciples
came
to
him,
and
awoke
him,
saying,
Lord,
save
us:
we
perish.
008:026
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Why
are
ye
fearful,
O
ye
of
little
faith?
Then
he
arose,
and
rebuked
the
winds
and
the
sea;
and
there
was
a
great
calm.
008:027
But
the
men
marvelled,
saying,
What
manner
of
man
is
this,
that
even
the
winds
and
the
sea
obey
him!
008:028
And
when
he
was
come
to
the
other
side
into
the
country
of
the
Gergesenes,
there
met
him
two
possessed
with
devils,
coming
out
of
the
tombs,
exceeding
fierce,
so
that
no
man
might
pass
by
that
way.
008:029
And,
behold,
they
cried
out,
saying,
What
have
we
to
do
with
thee,
Jesus,
thou
Son
of
God?
art
thou
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the
time?
008:030
And
there
was
a
good
way
off
from
them
an
herd
of
many
swine
feeding.
008:031
So
the
devils
besought
him,
saying,
If
thou
cast
us
out,
suffer
us
to
go
away
into
the
herd
of
swine.
008:032
And
he
said
unto
them,
Go.
And
when
they
were
come
out,
they
went
into
the
herd
of
swine:
and,
behold,
the
whole
herd
of
swine
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea,
and
perished
in
the
waters.
008:033
And
they
that
kept
them
fled,
and
went
their
ways
into
the
city,
and
told
every
thing,
and
what
was
befallen
to
the
possessed
of
the
devils.
008:034
And,
behold,
the
whole
city
came
out
to
meet
Jesus:
and
when
they
saw
him,
they
besought
him
that
he
would
depart
out
of
their
coasts.
009:001
And
he
entered
into
a
ship,
and
passed
over,
and
came
into
his
own
city.
009:002
And,
behold,
they
brought
to
him
a
man
sick
of
the
palsy,
lying
on
a
bed:
and
Jesus
seeing
their
faith
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
palsy;
Son,
be
of
good
cheer;
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee.
009:003
And,
behold,
certain
of
the
scribes
said
within
themselves,
This
man
blasphemeth.
009:004
And
Jesus
knowing
their
thoughts
said,
Wherefore
think
ye
evil
in
your
hearts?
009:005
For
whether
is
easier,
to
say,
Thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee;
or
to
say,
Arise,
and
walk?
009:006
But
that
ye
may
know
that
the
Son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
sins,
(then
saith
he
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy,)
Arise,
take
up
thy
bed,
and
go
unto
thine
house.
009:007
And
he
arose,
and
departed
to
his
house.
009:008
But
when
the
multitudes
saw
it,
they
marvelled,
and
glorified
God,
which
had
given
such
power
unto
men.
009:009
And
as
Jesus
passed
forth
from
thence,
he
saw
a
man,
named
Matthew,
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
custom:
and
he
saith
unto
him,
Follow
me.
And
he
arose,
and
followed
him.
009:010
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
Jesus
sat
at
meat
in
the
house,
behold,
many
publicans
and
sinners
came
and
sat
down
with
him
and
his
disciples.
009:011
And
when
the
Pharisees
saw
it,
they
said
unto
his
disciples,
Why
eateth
your
Master
with
publicans
and
sinners?
009:012
But
when
Jesus
heard
that,
he
said
unto
them,
They
that
be
whole
need
not
a
physician,
but
they
that
are
sick.
009:013
But
go
ye
and
learn
what
that
meaneth,
I
will
have
mercy,
and
not
sacrifice:
for
I
am
not
come
to
call
the
righteous,
but
sinners
to
repentance.
009:014
Then
came
to
him
the
disciples
of
John,
saying,
Why
do
we
and
the
Pharisees
fast
oft,
but
thy
disciples
fast
not?
009:015
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Can
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
mourn,
as
long
as
the
bridegroom
is
with
them?
but
the
days
will
come,
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
from
them,
and
then
shall
they
fast.
009:016
No
man
putteth
a
piece
of
new
cloth
unto
an
old
garment,
for
that
which
is
put
in
to
fill
it
up
taketh
from
the
garment,
and
the
rent
is
made
worse.
009:017
Neither
do
men
put
new
wine
into
old
bottles:
else
the
bottles
break,
and
the
wine
runneth
out,
and
the
bottles
perish:
but
they
put
new
wine
into
new
bottles,
and
both
are
preserved.
009:018
While
he
spake
these
things
unto
them,
behold,
there
came
a
certain
ruler,
and
worshipped
him,
saying,
My
daughter
is
even
now
dead:
but
come
and
lay
thy
hand
upon
her,
and
she
shall
live.
009:019
And
Jesus
arose,
and
followed
him,
and
so
did
his
disciples.
009:020
And,
behold,
a
woman,
which
was
diseased
with
an
issue
of
blood
twelve
years,
came
behind
him,
and
touched
the
hem
of
his
garment:
009:021
For
she
said
within
herself,
If
I
may
but
touch
his
garment,
I
shall
be
whole.
009:022
But
Jesus
turned
him
about,
and
when
he
saw
her,
he
said,
Daughter,
be
of
good
comfort;
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole.
And
the
woman
was
made
whole
from
that
hour.
009:023
And
when
Jesus
came
into
the
ruler's
house,
and
saw
the
minstrels
and
the
people
making
a
noise,
009:024
He
said
unto
them,
Give
place:
for
the
maid
is
not
dead,
but
sleepeth.
And
they
laughed
him
to
scorn.
009:025
But
when
the
people
were
put
forth,
he
went
in,
and
took
her
by
the
hand,
and
the
maid
arose.
009:026
And
the
fame
hereof
went
abroad
into
all
that
land.
009:027
And
when
Jesus
departed
thence,
two
blind
men
followed
him,
crying,
and
saying,
Thou
son
of
David,
have
mercy
on
us.
009:028
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
house,
the
blind
men
came
to
him:
and
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Believe
ye
that
I
am
able
to
do
this?
They
said
unto
him,
Yea,
Lord.
009:029
Then
touched
he
their
eyes,
saying,
According
to
your
faith
be
it
unto
you.
009:030
And
their
eyes
were
opened;
and
Jesus
straitly
charged
them,
saying,
See
that
no
man
know
it.
009:031
But
they,
when
they
were
departed,
spread
abroad
his
fame
in
all
that
country.
009:032
As
they
went
out,
behold,
they
brought
to
him
a
dumb
man
possessed
with
a
devil.
009:033
And
when
the
devil
