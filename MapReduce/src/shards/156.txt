was
cast
out,
the
dumb
spake:
and
the
multitudes
marvelled,
saying,
It
was
never
so
seen
in
Israel.
009:034
But
the
Pharisees
said,
He
casteth
out
devils
through
the
prince
of
the
devils.
009:035
And
Jesus
went
about
all
the
cities
and
villages,
teaching
in
their
synagogues,
and
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom,
and
healing
every
sickness
and
every
disease
among
the
people.
009:036
But
when
he
saw
the
multitudes,
he
was
moved
with
compassion
on
them,
because
they
fainted,
and
were
scattered
abroad,
as
sheep
having
no
shepherd.
009:037
Then
saith
he
unto
his
disciples,
The
harvest
truly
is
plenteous,
but
the
labourers
are
few;
009:038
Pray
ye
therefore
the
Lord
of
the
harvest,
that
he
will
send
forth
labourers
into
his
harvest.
010:001
And
when
he
had
called
unto
him
his
twelve
disciples,
he
gave
them
power
against
unclean
spirits,
to
cast
them
out,
and
to
heal
all
manner
of
sickness
and
all
manner
of
disease.
010:002
Now
the
names
of
the
twelve
apostles
are
these;
The
first,
Simon,
who
is
called
Peter,
and
Andrew
his
brother;
James
the
son
of
Zebedee,
and
John
his
brother;
010:003
Philip,
and
Bartholomew;
Thomas,
and
Matthew
the
publican;
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus,
and
Lebbaeus,
whose
surname
was
Thaddaeus;
010:004
Simon
the
Canaanite,
and
Judas
Iscariot,
who
also
betrayed
him.
010:005
These
twelve
Jesus
sent
forth,
and
commanded
them,
saying,
Go
not
into
the
way
of
the
Gentiles,
and
into
any
city
of
the
Samaritans
enter
ye
not:
010:006
But
go
rather
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
Israel.
010:007
And
as
ye
go,
preach,
saying,
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand.
010:008
Heal
the
sick,
cleanse
the
lepers,
raise
the
dead,
cast
out
devils:
freely
ye
have
received,
freely
give.
010:009
Provide
neither
gold,
nor
silver,
nor
brass
in
your
purses,
010:010
Nor
scrip
for
your
journey,
neither
two
coats,
neither
shoes,
nor
yet
staves:
for
the
workman
is
worthy
of
his
meat.
010:011
And
into
whatsoever
city
or
town
ye
shall
enter,
enquire
who
in
it
is
worthy;
and
there
abide
till
ye
go
thence.
010:012
And
when
ye
come
into
an
house,
salute
it.
010:013
And
if
the
house
be
worthy,
let
your
peace
come
upon
it:
but
if
it
be
not
worthy,
let
your
peace
return
to
you.
010:014
And
whosoever
shall
not
receive
you,
nor
hear
your
words,
when
ye
depart
out
of
that
house
or
city,
shake
off
the
dust
of
your
feet.
010:015
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
It
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrha
in
the
day
of
judgment,
than
for
that
city.
010:016
Behold,
I
send
you
forth
as
sheep
in
the
midst
of
wolves:
be
ye
therefore
wise
as
serpents,
and
harmless
as
doves.
010:017
But
beware
of
men:
for
they
will
deliver
you
up
to
the
councils,
and
they
will
scourge
you
in
their
synagogues;
010:018
And
ye
shall
be
brought
before
governors
and
kings
for
my
sake,
for
a
testimony
against
them
and
the
Gentiles.
010:019
But
when
they
deliver
you
up,
take
no
thought
how
or
what
ye
shall
speak:
for
it
shall
be
given
you
in
that
same
hour
what
ye
shall
speak.
010:020
For
it
is
not
ye
that
speak,
but
the
Spirit
of
your
Father
which
speaketh
in
you.
010:021
And
the
brother
shall
deliver
up
the
brother
to
death,
and
the
father
the
child:
and
the
children
shall
rise
up
against
their
parents,
and
cause
them
to
be
put
to
death.
010:022
And
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name's
sake:
but
he
that
endureth
to
the
end
shall
be
saved.
010:023
But
when
they
persecute
you
in
this
city,
flee
ye
into
another:
for
verily
I
say
unto
you,
Ye
shall
not
have
gone
over
the
cities
of
Israel,
till
the
Son
of
man
be
come.
010:024
The
disciple
is
not
above
his
master,
nor
the
servant
above
his
lord.
010:025
It
is
enough
for
the
disciple
that
he
be
as
his
master,
and
the
servant
as
his
lord.
If
they
have
called
the
master
of
the
house
Beelzebub,
how
much
more
shall
they
call
them
of
his
household?
010:026
Fear
them
not
therefore:
for
there
is
nothing
covered,
that
shall
not
be
revealed;
and
hid,
that
shall
not
be
known.
010:027
What
I
tell
you
in
darkness,
that
speak
ye
in
light:
and
what
ye
hear
in
the
ear,
that
preach
ye
upon
the
housetops.
010:028
And
fear
not
them
which
kill
the
body,
but
are
not
able
to
kill
the
soul:
but
rather
fear
him
which
is
able
to
destroy
both
soul
and
body
in
hell.
010:029
Are
not
two
sparrows
sold
for
a
farthing?
and
one
of
them
shall
not
fall
on
the
ground
without
your
Father.
010:030
But
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered.
010:031
Fear
ye
not
therefore,
ye
are
of
more
value
than
many
sparrows.
010:032
Whosoever
therefore
shall
confess
me
before
men,
him
will
I
confess
also
before
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
010:033
But
whosoever
shall
deny
me
before
men,
him
will
I
also
deny
before
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
010:034
Think
not
that
I
am
come
to
send
peace
on
earth:
I
came
not
to
send
peace,
but
a
sword.
010:035
For
I
am
come
to
set
a
man
at
variance
against
his
father,
and
the
daughter
against
her
mother,
and
the
daughter
in
law
against
her
mother
in
law.
010:036
And
a
man's
foes
shall
be
they
of
his
own
household.
010:037
He
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me:
and
he
that
loveth
son
or
daughter
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me.
010:038
And
he
that
taketh
not
his
cross,
and
followeth
after
me,
is
not
worthy
of
me.
010:039
He
that
findeth
his
life
shall
lose
it:
and
he
that
loseth
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it.
010:040
He
that
receiveth
you
receiveth
me,
and
he
that
receiveth
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
me.
010:041
He
that
receiveth
a
prophet
in
the
name
of
a
prophet
shall
receive
a
prophet's
reward;
and
he
that
receiveth
a
righteous
man
in
the
name
of
a
righteous
man
shall
receive
a
righteous
man's
reward.
010:042
And
whosoever
shall
give
to
drink
unto
one
of
these
little
ones
a
cup
of
cold
water
only
in
the
name
of
a
disciple,
verily
I
say
unto
you,
he
shall
in
no
wise
lose
his
reward.
011:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Jesus
had
made
an
end
of
commanding
his
twelve
disciples,
he
departed
thence
to
teach
and
to
preach
in
their
cities.
011:002
Now
when
John
had
heard
in
the
prison
the
works
of
Christ,
he
sent
two
of
his
disciples,
011:003
And
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
he
that
should
come,
or
do
we
look
for
another?
011:004
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Go
and
shew
John
again
those
things
which
ye
do
hear
and
see:
011:005
The
blind
receive
their
sight,
and
the
lame
walk,
the
lepers
are
cleansed,
and
the
deaf
hear,
the
dead
are
raised
up,
and
the
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
them.
011:006
And
blessed
is
he,
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
me.
011:007
And
as
they
departed,
Jesus
began
to
say
unto
the
multitudes
concerning
John,
What
went
ye
out
into
the
wilderness
to
see?
A
reed
shaken
with
the
wind?
011:008
But
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see?
A
man
clothed
in
soft
raiment?
behold,
they
that
wear
soft
clothing
are
in
kings'
houses.
011:009
But
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see?
A
prophet?
yea,
I
say
unto
you,
and
more
than
a
prophet.
011:010
For
this
is
he,
of
whom
it
is
written,
Behold,
I
send
my
messenger
before
thy
face,
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee.
011:011
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Among
them
that
are
born
of
women
there
hath
not
risen
a
greater
than
John
the
Baptist:
notwithstanding
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
greater
than
he.
011:012
And
from
the
days
of
John
the
Baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffereth
violence,
and
the
violent
take
it
by
force.
011:013
For
all
the
prophets
and
the
law
prophesied
until
John.
011:014
And
if
ye
will
receive
it,
this
is
Elias,
which
was
for
to
come.
011:015
He
that
hath
ears
to
hear,
let
him
hear.
011:016
But
whereunto
shall
I
liken
this
generation?
It
is
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
markets,
and
calling
unto
their
fellows,
011:017
And
saying,
We
have
piped
unto
you,
and
ye
have
not
danced;
we
have
mourned
unto
you,
and
ye
have
not
lamented.
011:018
For
John
came
neither
eating
nor
drinking,
and
they
say,
He
hath
a
devil.
011:019
The
Son
of
man
came
eating
and
drinking,
and
they
say,
Behold
a
man
gluttonous,
and
a
winebibber,
a
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners.
But
wisdom
is
justified
of
her
children.
011:020
Then
began
he
to
upbraid
the
cities
wherein
most
of
his
mighty
works
were
done,
because
they
repented
not:
011:021
Woe
unto
thee,
Chorazin!
woe
unto
thee,
Bethsaida!
for
if
the
mighty
works,
which
were
done
in
you,
had
been
done
in
Tyre
and
Sidon,
they
would
have
repented
long
ago
in
sackcloth
and
ashes.
011:022
But
I
say
unto
you,
It
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
at
the
day
of
judgment,
than
for
you.
011:023
And
thou,
Capernaum,
which
art
exalted
unto
heaven,
shalt
be
brought
down
to
hell:
for
if
the
mighty
works,
which
have
been
done
in
thee,
had
been
done
in
Sodom,
it
would
have
remained
until
this
day.
011:024
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
Sodom
in
the
day
of
judgment,
than
for
thee.
011:025
At
that
time
Jesus
answered
and
said,
I
thank
thee,
O
Father,
Lord
of
heaven
and
earth,
because
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent,
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes.
011:026
Even
so,
Father:
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight.
011:027
All
things
are
delivered
unto
me
of
my
Father:
and
no
man
knoweth
the
Son,
but
the
Father;
neither
knoweth
any
man
the
Father,
save
the
Son,
and
he
to
whomsoever
the
Son
will
reveal
him.
011:028
Come
unto
me,
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden,
and
I
will
give
you
rest.
011:029
Take
my
yoke
upon
you,
and
learn
of
me;
for
I
am
meek
and
lowly
in
heart:
and
ye
shall
find
rest
unto
your
souls.
011:030
For
my
yoke
is
easy,
and
my
burden
is
light.
012:001
At
that
time
Jesus
went
on
the
sabbath
day
through
the
corn;
and
his
disciples
were
an
hungred,
and
began
to
pluck
the
ears
of
corn
and
to
eat.
012:002
But
when
the
Pharisees
saw
it,
they
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thy
disciples
do
that
which
is
not
lawful
to
do
upon
the
sabbath
day.
012:003
But
he
said
unto
them,
Have
ye
not
read
what
David
did,
when
he
was
an
hungred,
and
they
that
were
with
him;
012:004
How
he
entered
into
the
house
of
God,
and
did
eat
the
shewbread,
which
was
not
lawful
for
him
to
eat,
neither
for
them
which
were
with
him,
but
only
for
the
priests?
012:005
Or
have
ye
not
read
in
the
law,
how
that
on
the
sabbath
days
the
priests
in
the
temple
profane
the
sabbath,
and
are
blameless?
012:006
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
in
this
place
is
one
greater
than
the
temple.
012:007
But
if
ye
had
known
what
this
meaneth,
I
will
have
mercy,
and
not
sacrifice,
ye
would
not
have
condemned
the
guiltless.
012:008
For
the
Son
of
man
is
Lord
even
of
the
sabbath
day.
012:009
And
when
he
was
departed
thence,
he
went
into
their
synagogue:
012:010
And,
behold,
there
was
a
man
which
had
his
hand
withered.
And
they
asked
him,
saying,
Is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
days?
that
they
might
accuse
him.
012:011
And
he
said
unto
them,
What
man
shall
there
be
among
you,
that
shall
have
one
sheep,
and
if
it
fall
into
a
pit
on
the
sabbath
day,
will
he
not
lay
hold
on
it,
and
lift
it
out?
012:012
How
much
then
is
a
man
better
than
a
sheep?
Wherefore
it
is
lawful
to
do
well
on
the
sabbath
days.
012:013
Then
saith
he
to
the
man,
Stretch
forth
thine
hand.
And
he
stretched
it
forth;
and
it
was
restored
whole,
like
as
the
other.
012:014
Then
the
Pharisees
went
out,
and
held
a
council
against
him,
how
they
might
destroy
him.
012:015
But
when
Jesus
knew
it,
he
withdrew
himself
from
thence:
and
great
multitudes
followed
him,
and
he
healed
them
all;
012:016
And
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
known:
012:017
That
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
Esaias
the
prophet,
saying,
012:018
Behold
my
servant,
whom
I
have
chosen;
my
beloved,
in
whom
my
soul
is
well
pleased:
I
will
put
my
spirit
upon
him,
and
he
shall
shew
judgment
to
the
Gentiles.
012:019
He
shall
not
strive,
nor
cry;
neither
shall
any
man
hear
his
voice
in
the
streets.
012:020
A
bruised
reed
shall
he
not
break,
and
smoking
flax
shall
he
not
quench,
till
he
send
forth
judgment
unto
victory.
012:021
And
in
his
name
shall
the
Gentiles
trust.
012:022
Then
was
brought
unto
him
one
possessed
with
a
devil,
blind,
and
dumb:
and
he
healed
him,
insomuch
that
the
blind
and
dumb
both
spake
and
saw.
012:023
And
all
the
people
were
amazed,
and
said,
Is
not
this
the
son
of
David?
012:024
But
when
the
Pharisees
heard
it,
they
said,
This
fellow
doth
not
cast
out
devils,
but
by
Beelzebub
the
prince
of
the
devils.
012:025
And
Jesus
knew
their
thoughts,
and
said
unto
them,
Every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
is
brought
to
desolation;
and
every
city
or
house
divided
against
itself
shall
not
stand:
012:026
And
if
Satan
cast
out
Satan,
he
is
divided
against
himself;
how
shall
then
his
kingdom
stand?
012:027
And
if
I
by
Beelzebub
cast
out
devils,
by
whom
do
your
children
cast
them
out?
therefore
they
shall
be
your
judges.
012:028
But
if
I
cast
out
devils
by
the
Spirit
of
God,
then
the
kingdom
of
God
is
come
unto
you.
012:029
Or
else
how
can
one
enter
into
a
strong
man's
house,
and
spoil
his
goods,
except
he
first
bind
the
strong
man?
and
then
he
will
spoil
his
house.
012:030
He
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
me;
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
scattereth
abroad.
012:031
Wherefore
I
say
unto
you,
All
manner
of
sin
and
blasphemy
shall
be
forgiven
unto
men:
but
the
blasphemy
against
the
Holy
Ghost
shall
not
be
forgiven
unto
men.
012:032
And
whosoever
speaketh
a
word
against
the
Son
of
man,
it
shall
be
forgiven
him:
but
whosoever
speaketh
against
the
Holy
Ghost,
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
him,
neither
in
this
world,
neither
in
the
world
to
come.
012:033
Either
make
the
tree
good,
and
his
fruit
good;
or
else
make
the
tree
corrupt,
and
his
fruit
corrupt:
for
the
tree
is
known
by
his
fruit.
012:034
O
generation
of
vipers,
how
can
ye,
being
evil,
speak
good
things?
for
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh.
012:035
A
good
man
out
of
the
good
treasure
of
the
heart
bringeth
forth
good
things:
and
an
evil
man
out
of
the
evil
treasure
bringeth
forth
evil
things.
012:036
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
every
idle
word
that
men
shall
speak,
they
shall
give
account
thereof
in
the
day
of
judgment.
012:037
For
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
justified,
and
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
condemned.
012:038
Then
certain
of
the
scribes
and
of
the
Pharisees
answered,
saying,
Master,
we
would
see
a
sign
from
thee.
012:039
But
he
answered
and
said
unto
them,
An
evil
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
sign;
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
to
it,
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
Jonas:
012:040
For
as
Jonas
was
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
whale's
belly;
so
shall
the
Son
of
man
be
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
heart
of
the
earth.
012:041
The
men
of
Nineveh
shall
rise
in
judgment
with
this
generation,
and
shall
condemn
it:
because
they
repented
at
the
preaching
of
Jonas;
and,
behold,
a
greater
than
Jonas
is
here.
012:042
The
queen
of
the
south
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
generation,
and
shall
condemn
it:
for
she
came
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
Solomon;
and,
behold,
a
greater
than
Solomon
is
here.
012:043
When
the
unclean
spirit
is
gone
out
of
a
man,
he
walketh
through
dry
places,
seeking
rest,
and
findeth
none.
012:044
Then
he
saith,
I
will
return
into
my
house
from
whence
I
came
out;
and
when
he
is
come,
he
findeth
it
empty,
swept,
and
garnished.
012:045
Then
goeth
he,
and
taketh
with
himself
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
himself,
and
they
enter
in
and
dwell
there:
and
the
last
state
of
that
man
is
worse
than
the
first.
Even
so
shall
it
be
also
unto
this
wicked
generation.
012:046
While
he
yet
talked
to
the
people,
behold,
his
mother
and
his
brethren
stood
without,
desiring
to
speak
with
him.
012:047
Then
one
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without,
desiring
to
speak
with
thee.
012:048
But
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
that
told
him,
Who
is
my
mother?
and
who
are
my
brethren?
012:049
And
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
his
disciples,
and
said,
Behold
my
mother
and
my
brethren!
012:050
For
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven,
the
same
is
my
brother,
and
sister,
and
mother.
013:001
The
same
day
went
Jesus
out
of
the
house,
and
sat
by
the
sea
side.
013:002
And
great
multitudes
were
gathered
together
unto
him,
so
that
he
went
into
a
ship,
and
sat;
and
the
whole
multitude
stood
on
the
shore.
013:003
And
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
in
parables,
saying,
Behold,
a
sower
went
forth
to
sow;
013:004
And
when
he
sowed,
some
seeds
fell
by
the
way
side,
and
the
fowls
came
and
devoured
them
up:
013:005
Some
fell
upon
stony
places,
where
they
had
not
much
earth:
and
forthwith
they
sprung
up,
because
they
had
no
deepness
of
earth:
013:006
And
when
the
sun
was
up,
they
were
scorched;
and
because
they
had
no
root,
they
withered
away.
013:007
And
some
fell
among
thorns;
and
the
thorns
sprung
up,
and
choked
them:
013:008
But
other
fell
into
good
ground,
and
brought
forth
fruit,
some
an
hundredfold,
some
sixtyfold,
some
thirtyfold.
013:009
Who
hath
ears
to
hear,
let
him
hear.
013:010
And
the
disciples
came,
and
said
unto
him,
Why
speakest
thou
unto
them
in
parables?
013:011
He
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Because
it
is
given
unto
you
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven,
but
to
them
it
is
not
given.
013:012
For
whosoever
hath,
to
him
shall
be
given,
and
he
shall
have
more
abundance:
but
whosoever
hath
not,
from
him
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
he
hath.
013:013
Therefore
speak
I
to
them
in
parables:
because
they
seeing
see
not;
and
hearing
they
hear
not,
neither
do
they
understand.
013:014
And
in
them
is
fulfilled
the
prophecy
of
Esaias,
which
saith,
By
hearing
ye
shall
hear,
and
shall
not
understand;
and
seeing
ye
shall
see,
and
shall
not
perceive:
013:015
For
this
people's
heart
is
waxed
gross,
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
hearing,
and
their
eyes
they
have
closed;
lest
at
any
time
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears,
and
should
understand
with
their
heart,
and
should
be
converted,
and
I
should
heal
them.
013:016
But
blessed
are
your
eyes,
for
they
see:
and
your
ears,
for
they
hear.
013:017
For
verily
I
say
unto
you,
That
many
prophets
and
righteous
men
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
see,
and
have
not
seen
them;
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
hear,
and
have
not
heard
them.
013:018
Hear
ye
therefore
the
parable
of
the
sower.
013:019
When
any
one
heareth
the
word
of
the
kingdom,
and
understandeth
it
not,
then
cometh
the
wicked
one,
and
catcheth
away
that
which
was
sown
in
his
heart.
This
is
he
which
received
seed
by
the
way
side.
013:020
But
he
that
received
the
seed
into
stony
places,
the
same
is
he
that
heareth
the
word,
and
anon
with
joy
receiveth
it;
013:021
Yet
hath
he
not
root
in
himself,
but
dureth
for
a
while:
for
when
tribulation
or
persecution
ariseth
because
of
the
word,
by
and
by
he
is
offended.
013:022
He
also
that
received
seed
among
the
thorns
is
he
that
heareth
the
word;
and
the
care
of
this
world,
and
the
deceitfulness
of
riches,
choke
the
word,
and
he
becometh
unfruitful.
013:023
But
he
that
received
seed
into
the
good
ground
is
he
that
heareth
the
word,
and
understandeth
it;
which
also
beareth
fruit,
and
bringeth
forth,
some
an
hundredfold,
some
sixty,
some
thirty.
013:024
Another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
them,
saying,
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
likened
unto
a
man
which
sowed
good
seed
in
his
field:
013:025
But
while
men
slept,
his
enemy
came
and
sowed
tares
among
the
wheat,
and
went
his
way.
013:026
But
when
the
blade
was
sprung
up,
and
brought
forth
fruit,
then
appeared
the
tares
also.
013:027
So
the
servants
of
the
householder
came
and
said
unto
him,
Sir,
didst
not
thou
sow
good
seed
in
thy
field?
from
whence
then
hath
it
tares?
013:028
He
said
unto
them,
An
enemy
hath
done
this.
The
servants
said
unto
him,
Wilt
thou
then
that
we
go
and
gather
them
up?
013:029
But
he
said,
Nay;
lest
while
ye
gather
up
the
tares,
ye
root
up
also
the
wheat
with
them.
013:030
Let
both
grow
together
until
the
harvest:
and
in
the
time
of
harvest
I
will
say
to
the
reapers,
Gather
ye
together
first
the
tares,
and
bind
them
in
bundles
to
burn
them:
but
gather
the
wheat
into
my
barn.
013:031
Another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
them,
saying,
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
to
a
grain
of
mustard
seed,
which
a
man
took,
and
sowed
in
his
field:
013:032
Which
indeed
is
the
least
of
all
seeds:
but
when
it
is
grown,
it
is
the
greatest
among
herbs,
and
becometh
a
tree,
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
come
and
lodge
in
the
branches
thereof.
013:033
Another
parable
spake
he
unto
them;
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
leaven,
which
a
woman
took,
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
meal,
till
the
whole
was
leavened.
013:034
All
these
things
spake
Jesus
unto
the
multitude
in
parables;
and
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
them:
013:035
That
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet,
saying,
I
will
open
my
mouth
in
parables;
I
will
utter
things
which
have
been
kept
secret
from
the
foundation
of
the
world.
013:036
Then
Jesus
sent
the
multitude
away,
and
went
into
the
house:
and
his
disciples
came
unto
him,
saying,
Declare
unto
us
the
parable
of
the
tares
of
the
field.
013:037
He
answered
and
said
unto
them,
He
that
soweth
the
good
seed
is
the
Son
of
man;
013:038
The
field
is
the
world;
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom;
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one;
013:039
The
enemy
that
sowed
them
is
the
devil;
the
harvest
is
the
end
of
the
world;
and
the
reapers
are
the
angels.
013:040
As
therefore
the
tares
are
gathered
and
burned
in
the
fire;
so
shall
it
be
in
the
end
of
this
world.
013:041
The
Son
of
man
shall
send
forth
his
angels,
and
they
shall
gather
out
of
his
kingdom
all
things
that
offend,
and
them
which
do
iniquity;
013:042
And
shall
cast
them
into
a
furnace
of
fire:
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth.
013:043
Then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
their
Father.
Who
hath
ears
to
hear,
let
him
hear.
013:044
Again,
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
treasure
hid
in
a
field;
the
which
