when
a
man
hath
found,
he
hideth,
and
for
joy
thereof
goeth
and
selleth
all
that
he
hath,
and
buyeth
that
field.
013:045
Again,
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
merchant
man,
seeking
goodly
pearls:
013:046
Who,
when
he
had
found
one
pearl
of
great
price,
went
and
sold
all
that
he
had,
and
bought
it.
013:047
Again,
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
net,
that
was
cast
into
the
sea,
and
gathered
of
every
kind:
013:048
Which,
when
it
was
full,
they
drew
to
shore,
and
sat
down,
and
gathered
the
good
into
vessels,
but
cast
the
bad
away.
013:049
So
shall
it
be
at
the
end
of
the
world:
the
angels
shall
come
forth,
and
sever
the
wicked
from
among
the
just,
013:050
And
shall
cast
them
into
the
furnace
of
fire:
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth.
013:051
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Have
ye
understood
all
these
things?
They
say
unto
him,
Yea,
Lord.
013:052
Then
said
he
unto
them,
Therefore
every
scribe
which
is
instructed
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
that
is
an
householder,
which
bringeth
forth
out
of
his
treasure
things
new
and
old.
013:053
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
Jesus
had
finished
these
parables,
he
departed
thence.
013:054
And
when
he
was
come
into
his
own
country,
he
taught
them
in
their
synagogue,
insomuch
that
they
were
astonished,
and
said,
Whence
hath
this
man
this
wisdom,
and
these
mighty
works?
013:055
Is
not
this
the
carpenter's
son?
is
not
his
mother
called
Mary?
and
his
brethren,
James,
and
Joses,
and
Simon,
and
Judas?
013:056
And
his
sisters,
are
they
not
all
with
us?
Whence
then
hath
this
man
all
these
things?
013:057
And
they
were
offended
in
him.
But
Jesus
said
unto
them,
A
prophet
is
not
without
honour,
save
in
his
own
country,
and
in
his
own
house.
013:058
And
he
did
not
many
mighty
works
there
because
of
their
unbelief.
014:001
At
that
time
Herod
the
tetrarch
heard
of
the
fame
of
Jesus,
014:002
And
said
unto
his
servants,
This
is
John
the
Baptist;
he
is
risen
from
the
dead;
and
therefore
mighty
works
do
shew
forth
themselves
in
him.
014:003
For
Herod
had
laid
hold
on
John,
and
bound
him,
and
put
him
in
prison
for
Herodias'
sake,
his
brother
Philip's
wife.
014:004
For
John
said
unto
him,
It
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
have
her.
014:005
And
when
he
would
have
put
him
to
death,
he
feared
the
multitude,
because
they
counted
him
as
a
prophet.
014:006
But
when
Herod's
birthday
was
kept,
the
daughter
of
Herodias
danced
before
them,
and
pleased
Herod.
014:007
Whereupon
he
promised
with
an
oath
to
give
her
whatsoever
she
would
ask.
014:008
And
she,
being
before
instructed
of
her
mother,
said,
Give
me
here
John
Baptist's
head
in
a
charger.
014:009
And
the
king
was
sorry:
nevertheless
for
the
oath's
sake,
and
them
which
sat
with
him
at
meat,
he
commanded
it
to
be
given
her.
014:010
And
he
sent,
and
beheaded
John
in
the
prison.
014:011
And
his
head
was
brought
in
a
charger,
and
given
to
the
damsel:
and
she
brought
it
to
her
mother.
014:012
And
his
disciples
came,
and
took
up
the
body,
and
buried
it,
and
went
and
told
Jesus.
014:013
When
Jesus
heard
of
it,
he
departed
thence
by
ship
into
a
desert
place
apart:
and
when
the
people
had
heard
thereof,
they
followed
him
on
foot
out
of
the
cities.
014:014
And
Jesus
went
forth,
and
saw
a
great
multitude,
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
them,
and
he
healed
their
sick.
014:015
And
when
it
was
evening,
his
disciples
came
to
him,
saying,
This
is
a
desert
place,
and
the
time
is
now
past;
send
the
multitude
away,
that
they
may
go
into
the
villages,
and
buy
themselves
victuals.
014:016
But
Jesus
said
unto
them,
They
need
not
depart;
give
ye
them
to
eat.
014:017
And
they
say
unto
him,
We
have
here
but
five
loaves,
and
two
fishes.
014:018
He
said,
Bring
them
hither
to
me.
014:019
And
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
grass,
and
took
the
five
loaves,
and
the
two
fishes,
and
looking
up
to
heaven,
he
blessed,
and
brake,
and
gave
the
loaves
to
his
disciples,
and
the
disciples
to
the
multitude.
014:020
And
they
did
all
eat,
and
were
filled:
and
they
took
up
of
the
fragments
that
remained
twelve
baskets
full.
014:021
And
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
five
thousand
men,
beside
women
and
children.
014:022
And
straightway
Jesus
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
a
ship,
and
to
go
before
him
unto
the
other
side,
while
he
sent
the
multitudes
away.
014:023
And
when
he
had
sent
the
multitudes
away,
he
went
up
into
a
mountain
apart
to
pray:
and
when
the
evening
was
come,
he
was
there
alone.
014:024
But
the
ship
was
now
in
the
midst
of
the
sea,
tossed
with
waves:
for
the
wind
was
contrary.
014:025
And
in
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
Jesus
went
unto
them,
walking
on
the
sea.
014:026
And
when
the
disciples
saw
him
walking
on
the
sea,
they
were
troubled,
saying,
It
is
a
spirit;
and
they
cried
out
for
fear.
014:027
But
straightway
Jesus
spake
unto
them,
saying,
Be
of
good
cheer;
it
is
I;
be
not
afraid.
014:028
And
Peter
answered
him
and
said,
Lord,
if
it
be
thou,
bid
me
come
unto
thee
on
the
water.
014:029
And
he
said,
Come.
And
when
Peter
was
come
down
out
of
the
ship,
he
walked
on
the
water,
to
go
to
Jesus.
014:030
But
when
he
saw
the
wind
boisterous,
he
was
afraid;
and
beginning
to
sink,
he
cried,
saying,
Lord,
save
me.
014:031
And
immediately
Jesus
stretched
forth
his
hand,
and
caught
him,
and
said
unto
him,
O
thou
of
little
faith,
wherefore
didst
thou
doubt?
014:032
And
when
they
were
come
into
the
ship,
the
wind
ceased.
014:033
Then
they
that
were
in
the
ship
came
and
worshipped
him,
saying,
Of
a
truth
thou
art
the
Son
of
God.
014:034
And
when
they
were
gone
over,
they
came
into
the
land
of
Gennesaret.
014:035
And
when
the
men
of
that
place
had
knowledge
of
him,
they
sent
out
into
all
that
country
round
about,
and
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
diseased;
014:036
And
besought
him
that
they
might
only
touch
the
hem
of
his
garment:
and
as
many
as
touched
were
made
perfectly
whole.
015:001
Then
came
to
Jesus
scribes
and
Pharisees,
which
were
of
Jerusalem,
saying,
015:002
Why
do
thy
disciples
transgress
the
tradition
of
the
elders?
for
they
wash
not
their
hands
when
they
eat
bread.
015:003
But
he
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Why
do
ye
also
transgress
the
commandment
of
God
by
your
tradition?
015:004
For
God
commanded,
saying,
Honour
thy
father
and
mother:
and,
He
that
curseth
father
or
mother,
let
him
die
the
death.
015:005
But
ye
say,
Whosoever
shall
say
to
his
father
or
his
mother,
It
is
a
gift,
by
whatsoever
thou
mightest
be
profited
by
me;
015:006
And
honour
not
his
father
or
his
mother,
he
shall
be
free.
Thus
have
ye
made
the
commandment
of
God
of
none
effect
by
your
tradition.
015:007
Ye
hypocrites,
well
did
Esaias
prophesy
of
you,
saying,
015:008
This
people
draweth
nigh
unto
me
with
their
mouth,
and
honoureth
me
with
their
lips;
but
their
heart
is
far
from
me.
015:009
But
in
vain
they
do
worship
me,
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
men.
015:010
And
he
called
the
multitude,
and
said
unto
them,
Hear,
and
understand:
015:011
Not
that
which
goeth
into
the
mouth
defileth
a
man;
but
that
which
cometh
out
of
the
mouth,
this
defileth
a
man.
015:012
Then
came
his
disciples,
and
said
unto
him,
Knowest
thou
that
the
Pharisees
were
offended,
after
they
heard
this
saying?
015:013
But
he
answered
and
said,
Every
plant,
which
my
heavenly
Father
hath
not
planted,
shall
be
rooted
up.
015:014
Let
them
alone:
they
be
blind
leaders
of
the
blind.
And
if
the
blind
lead
the
blind,
both
shall
fall
into
the
ditch.
015:015
Then
answered
Peter
and
said
unto
him,
Declare
unto
us
this
parable.
015:016
And
Jesus
said,
Are
ye
also
yet
without
understanding?
015:017
Do
not
ye
yet
understand,
that
whatsoever
entereth
in
at
the
mouth
goeth
into
the
belly,
and
is
cast
out
into
the
draught?
015:018
But
those
things
which
proceed
out
of
the
mouth
come
forth
from
the
heart;
and
they
defile
the
man.
015:019
For
out
of
the
heart
proceed
evil
thoughts,
murders,
adulteries,
fornications,
thefts,
false
witness,
blasphemies:
015:020
These
are
the
things
which
defile
a
man:
but
to
eat
with
unwashen
hands
defileth
not
a
man.
015:021
Then
Jesus
went
thence,
and
departed
into
the
coasts
of
Tyre
and
Sidon.
015:022
And,
behold,
a
woman
of
Canaan
came
out
of
the
same
coasts,
and
cried
unto
him,
saying,
Have
mercy
on
me,
O
Lord,
thou
son
of
David;
my
daughter
is
grievously
vexed
with
a
devil.
015:023
But
he
answered
her
not
a
word.
And
his
disciples
came
and
besought
him,
saying,
Send
her
away;
for
she
crieth
after
us.
015:024
But
he
answered
and
said,
I
am
not
sent
but
unto
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
Israel.
015:025
Then
came
she
and
worshipped
him,
saying,
Lord,
help
me.
015:026
But
he
answered
and
said,
It
is
not
meet
to
take
the
children's
bread,
and
to
cast
it
to
dogs.
015:027
And
she
said,
Truth,
Lord:
yet
the
dogs
eat
of
the
crumbs
which
fall
from
their
masters'
table.
015:028
Then
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her,
O
woman,
great
is
thy
faith:
be
it
unto
thee
even
as
thou
wilt.
And
her
daughter
was
made
whole
from
that
very
hour.
015:029
And
Jesus
departed
from
thence,
and
came
nigh
unto
the
sea
of
Galilee;
and
went
up
into
a
mountain,
and
sat
down
there.
015:030
And
great
multitudes
came
unto
him,
having
with
them
those
that
were
lame,
blind,
dumb,
maimed,
and
many
others,
and
cast
them
down
at
Jesus'
feet;
and
he
healed
them:
015:031
Insomuch
that
the
multitude
wondered,
when
they
saw
the
dumb
to
speak,
the
maimed
to
be
whole,
the
lame
to
walk,
and
the
blind
to
see:
and
they
glorified
the
God
of
Israel.
015:032
Then
Jesus
called
his
disciples
unto
him,
and
said,
I
have
compassion
on
the
multitude,
because
they
continue
with
me
now
three
days,
and
have
nothing
to
eat:
and
I
will
not
send
them
away
fasting,
lest
they
faint
in
the
way.
015:033
And
his
disciples
say
unto
him,
Whence
should
we
have
so
much
bread
in
the
wilderness,
as
to
fill
so
great
a
multitude?
015:034
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
How
many
loaves
have
ye?
And
they
said,
Seven,
and
a
few
little
fishes.
015:035
And
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
ground.
015:036
And
he
took
the
seven
loaves
and
the
fishes,
and
gave
thanks,
and
brake
them,
and
gave
to
his
disciples,
and
the
disciples
to
the
multitude.
015:037
And
they
did
all
eat,
and
were
filled:
and
they
took
up
of
the
broken
meat
that
was
left
seven
baskets
full.
015:038
And
they
that
did
eat
were
four
thousand
men,
beside
women
and
children.
015:039
And
he
sent
away
the
multitude,
and
took
ship,
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
Magdala.
016:001
The
Pharisees
also
with
the
Sadducees
came,
and
tempting
desired
him
that
he
would
shew
them
a
sign
from
heaven.
016:002
He
answered
and
said
unto
them,
When
it
is
evening,
ye
say,
It
will
be
fair
weather:
for
the
sky
is
red.
016:003
And
in
the
morning,
It
will
be
foul
weather
to
day:
for
the
sky
is
red
and
lowering.
O
ye
hypocrites,
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky;
but
can
ye
not
discern
the
signs
of
the
times?
016:004
A
wicked
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
sign;
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
it,
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
Jonas.
And
he
left
them,
and
departed.
016:005
And
when
his
disciples
were
come
to
the
other
side,
they
had
forgotten
to
take
bread.
016:006
Then
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Take
heed
and
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees
and
of
the
Sadducees.
016:007
And
they
reasoned
among
themselves,
saying,
It
is
because
we
have
taken
no
bread.
016:008
Which
when
Jesus
perceived,
he
said
unto
them,
O
ye
of
little
faith,
why
reason
ye
among
yourselves,
because
ye
have
brought
no
bread?
016:009
Do
ye
not
yet
understand,
neither
remember
the
five
loaves
of
the
five
thousand,
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
up?
016:010
Neither
the
seven
loaves
of
the
four
thousand,
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
up?
016:011
How
is
it
that
ye
do
not
understand
that
I
spake
it
not
to
you
concerning
bread,
that
ye
should
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees
and
of
the
Sadducees?
016:012
Then
understood
they
how
that
he
bade
them
not
beware
of
the
leaven
of
bread,
but
of
the
doctrine
of
the
Pharisees
and
of
the
Sadducees.
016:013
When
Jesus
came
into
the
coasts
of
Caesarea
Philippi,
he
asked
his
disciples,
saying,
Whom
do
men
say
that
I
the
Son
of
man
am?
016:014
And
they
said,
Some
say
that
thou
art
John
the
Baptist:
some,
Elias;
and
others,
Jeremias,
or
one
of
the
prophets.
016:015
He
saith
unto
them,
But
whom
say
ye
that
I
am?
016:016
And
Simon
Peter
answered
and
said,
Thou
art
the
Christ,
the
Son
of
the
living
God.
016:017
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Blessed
art
thou,
Simon
Barjona:
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
unto
thee,
but
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
016:018
And
I
say
also
unto
thee,
That
thou
art
Peter,
and
upon
this
rock
I
will
build
my
church;
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it.
016:019
And
I
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven:
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven:
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven.
016:020
Then
charged
he
his
disciples
that
they
should
tell
no
man
that
he
was
Jesus
the
Christ.
016:021
From
that
time
forth
began
Jesus
to
shew
unto
his
disciples,
how
that
he
must
go
unto
Jerusalem,
and
suffer
many
things
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes,
and
be
killed,
and
be
raised
again
the
third
day.
016:022
Then
Peter
took
him,
and
began
to
rebuke
him,
saying,
Be
it
far
from
thee,
Lord:
this
shall
not
be
unto
thee.
016:023
But
he
turned,
and
said
unto
Peter,
Get
thee
behind
me,
Satan:
thou
art
an
offence
unto
me:
for
thou
savourest
not
the
things
that
be
of
God,
but
those
that
be
of
men.
016:024
Then
said
Jesus
unto
his
disciples,
If
any
man
will
come
after
me,
let
him
deny
himself,
and
take
up
his
cross,
and
follow
me.
016:025
For
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it:
and
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it.
016:026
For
what
is
a
man
profited,
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
world,
and
lose
his
own
soul?
or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul?
016:027
For
the
Son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
glory
of
his
Father
with
his
angels;
and
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
works.
016:028
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
There
be
some
standing
here,
which
shall
not
taste
of
death,
till
they
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
his
kingdom.
017:001
And
after
six
days
Jesus
taketh
Peter,
James,
and
John
his
brother,
and
bringeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
apart,
017:002
And
was
transfigured
before
them:
and
his
face
did
shine
as
the
sun,
and
his
raiment
was
white
as
the
light.
017:003
And,
behold,
there
appeared
unto
them
Moses
and
Elias
talking
with
him.
017:004
Then
answered
Peter,
and
said
unto
Jesus,
Lord,
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here:
if
thou
wilt,
let
us
make
here
three
tabernacles;
one
for
thee,
and
one
for
Moses,
and
one
for
Elias.
017:005
While
he
yet
spake,
behold,
a
bright
cloud
overshadowed
them:
and
behold
a
voice
out
of
the
cloud,
which
said,
This
is
my
beloved
Son,
in
whom
I
am
well
pleased;
hear
ye
him.
017:006
And
when
the
disciples
heard
it,
they
fell
on
their
face,
and
were
sore
afraid.
017:007
And
Jesus
came
and
touched
them,
and
said,
Arise,
and
be
not
afraid.
017:008
And
when
they
had
lifted
up
their
eyes,
they
saw
no
man,
save
Jesus
only.
017:009
And
as
they
came
down
from
the
mountain,
Jesus
charged
them,
saying,
Tell
the
vision
to
no
man,
until
the
Son
of
man
be
risen
again
from
the
dead.
017:010
And
his
disciples
asked
him,
saying,
Why
then
say
the
scribes
that
Elias
must
first
come?
017:011
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Elias
truly
shall
first
come,
and
restore
all
things.
017:012
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
Elias
is
come
already,
and
they
knew
him
not,
but
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
listed.
Likewise
shall
also
the
Son
of
man
suffer
of
them.
017:013
Then
the
disciples
understood
that
he
spake
unto
them
of
John
the
Baptist.
017:014
And
when
they
were
come
to
the
multitude,
there
came
to
him
a
certain
man,
kneeling
down
to
him,
and
saying,
017:015
Lord,
have
mercy
on
my
son:
for
he
is
lunatick,
and
sore
vexed:
for
ofttimes
he
falleth
into
the
fire,
and
oft
into
the
water.
017:016
And
I
brought
him
to
thy
disciples,
and
they
could
not
cure
him.
017:017
Then
Jesus
answered
and
said,
O
faithless
and
perverse
generation,
how
long
shall
I
be
with
you?
how
long
shall
I
suffer
you?
bring
him
hither
to
me.
017:018
And
Jesus
rebuked
the
devil;
and
he
departed
out
of
him:
and
the
child
was
cured
from
that
very
hour.
017:019
Then
came
the
disciples
to
Jesus
apart,
and
said,
Why
could
not
we
cast
him
out?
017:020
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Because
of
your
unbelief:
for
verily
I
say
unto
you,
If
ye
have
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed,
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain,
Remove
hence
to
yonder
place;
and
it
shall
remove;
and
nothing
shall
be
impossible
unto
you.
017:021
Howbeit
this
kind
goeth
not
out
but
by
prayer
and
fasting.
017:022
And
while
they
abode
in
Galilee,
Jesus
said
unto
them,
The
Son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
men:
017:023
And
they
shall
kill
him,
and
the
third
day
he
shall
be
raised
again.
And
they
were
exceeding
sorry.
017:024
And
when
they
were
come
to
Capernaum,
they
that
received
tribute
money
came
to
Peter,
and
said,
Doth
not
your
master
pay
tribute?
017:025
He
saith,
Yes.
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
house,
Jesus
prevented
him,
saying,
What
thinkest
thou,
Simon?
of
whom
do
the
kings
of
the
earth
take
custom
or
tribute?
of
their
own
children,
or
of
strangers?
017:026
Peter
saith
unto
him,
Of
strangers.
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
Then
are
the
children
free.
017:027
Notwithstanding,
lest
we
should
offend
them,
go
thou
to
the
sea,
and
cast
an
hook,
and
take
up
the
fish
that
first
cometh
up;
and
when
thou
hast
opened
his
mouth,
thou
shalt
find
a
piece
of
money:
that
take,
and
give
unto
them
for
me
and
thee.
018:001
At
the
same
time
came
the
disciples
unto
Jesus,
saying,
Who
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven?
018:002
And
Jesus
called
a
little
child
unto
him,
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them,
018:003
And
said,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Except
ye
be
converted,
and
become
as
little
children,
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
018:004
Whosoever
therefore
shall
humble
himself
as
this
little
child,
the
same
is
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
018:005
And
whoso
shall
receive
one
such
little
child
in
my
name
receiveth
me.
018:006
But
whoso
shall
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
which
believe
in
me,
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck,
and
that
he
were
drowned
in
the
depth
of
the
sea.
018:007
Woe
unto
the
world
because
of
offences!
for
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
come;
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offence
cometh!
018:008
Wherefore
if
thy
hand
or
thy
foot
offend
thee,
cut
them
off,
and
cast
them
from
thee:
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
halt
or
maimed,
rather
than
having
two
hands
or
two
feet
to
be
cast
into
everlasting
fire.
018:009
And
if
thine
eye
offend
thee,
pluck
it
out,
and
cast
it
from
thee:
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
with
one
eye,
rather
than
having
two
eyes
to
be
cast
into
hell
fire.
018:010
Take
heed
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
ones;
for
I
say
unto
you,
That
in
heaven
their
angels
do
always
behold
the
face
of
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
018:011
For
the
Son
of
man
is
come
to
save
that
which
was
lost.
018:012
How
think
ye?
if
a
man
have
an
hundred
sheep,
and
one
of
them
be
gone
astray,
doth
he
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine,
and
goeth
into
the
mountains,
and
seeketh
that
which
is
gone
astray?
018:013
And
if
so
be
that
he
find
it,
verily
I
say
unto
you,
he
rejoiceth
more
of
that
sheep,
than
of
the
ninety
and
nine
which
went
not
astray.
018:014
Even
so
it
is
not
the
will
of
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven,
that
one
of
these
little
ones
should
perish.
018:015
Moreover
if
thy
brother
shall
trespass
against
thee,
go
and
tell
him
his
fault
between
thee
and
him
alone:
if
he
shall
hear
thee,
thou
hast
gained
thy
brother.
018:016
But
if
he
will
not
hear
thee,
then
take
with
thee
one
or
two
more,
that
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
every
word
may
be
established.
018:017
And
if
he
shall
neglect
to
hear
them,
tell
it
unto
the
church:
but
if
he
neglect
to
hear
the
church,
let
him
be
unto
thee
as
an
heathen
man
and
a
publican.
018:018
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Whatsoever
ye
shall
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven:
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven.
018:019
Again
I
say
unto
you,
That
if
two
of
you
shall
agree
on
earth
as
touching
any
thing
that
they
shall
ask,
it
shall
be
done
for
them
of
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
018:020
For
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name,
there
am
I
in
the
midst
of
them.
018:021
Then
came
Peter
to
him,
and
said,
Lord,
how
oft
shall
my
brother
sin
against
me,
and
I
forgive
him?
till
seven
times?
018:022
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
I
say
not
unto
thee,
Until
seven
times:
but,
Until
seventy
times
seven.
018:023
Therefore
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
likened
unto
a
certain
king,
which
would
take
account
of
his
servants.
018:024
And
when
he
had
begun
to
reckon,
one
was
brought
unto
him,
which
owed
him
ten
thousand
talents.
018:025
But
forasmuch
as
he
had
not
to
pay,
his
lord
commanded
him
to
be
sold,
and
his
wife,
and
children,
and
all
that
he
had,
and
payment
to
be
made.
018:026
The
servant
therefore
fell
down,
and
worshipped
him,
saying,
Lord,
have
patience
with
me,
and
I
will
pay
thee
all.
018:027
Then
the
lord
of
that
servant
was
moved
with
compassion,
and
loosed
him,
and
forgave
him
the
debt.
018:028
But
the
same
servant
went
out,
and
found
one
of
his
fellowservants,
which
owed
him
an
hundred
pence:
and
he
laid
hands
on
him,
and
took
him
by
the
throat,
saying,
Pay
me
that
thou
owest.
018:029
And
his
fellowservant
fell
down
at
his
feet,
and
besought
him,
saying,
Have
patience
with
me,
and
I
will
pay
thee
all.
018:030
And
he
would
not:
but
went
and
cast
him
into
prison,
till
he
should
pay
the
debt.
018:031
So
when
his
fellowservants
saw
what
was
done,
they
were
very
sorry,
and
came
and
told
unto
their
lord
all
that
was
done.
018:032
Then
his
lord,
after
that
he
had
