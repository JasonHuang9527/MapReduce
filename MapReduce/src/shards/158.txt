called
him,
said
unto
him,
O
thou
wicked
servant,
I
forgave
thee
all
that
debt,
because
thou
desiredst
me:
018:033
Shouldest
not
thou
also
have
had
compassion
on
thy
fellowservant,
even
as
I
had
pity
on
thee?
018:034
And
his
lord
was
wroth,
and
delivered
him
to
the
tormentors,
till
he
should
pay
all
that
was
due
unto
him.
018:035
So
likewise
shall
my
heavenly
Father
do
also
unto
you,
if
ye
from
your
hearts
forgive
not
every
one
his
brother
their
trespasses.
019:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
Jesus
had
finished
these
sayings,
he
departed
from
Galilee,
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
Judaea
beyond
Jordan;
019:002
And
great
multitudes
followed
him;
and
he
healed
them
there.
019:003
The
Pharisees
also
came
unto
him,
tempting
him,
and
saying
unto
him,
Is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife
for
every
cause?
019:004
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Have
ye
not
read,
that
he
which
made
them
at
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
female,
019:005
And
said,
For
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
father
and
mother,
and
shall
cleave
to
his
wife:
and
they
twain
shall
be
one
flesh?
019:006
Wherefore
they
are
no
more
twain,
but
one
flesh.
What
therefore
God
hath
joined
together,
let
not
man
put
asunder.
019:007
They
say
unto
him,
Why
did
Moses
then
command
to
give
a
writing
of
divorcement,
and
to
put
her
away?
019:008
He
saith
unto
them,
Moses
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
suffered
you
to
put
away
your
wives:
but
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
so.
019:009
And
I
say
unto
you,
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife,
except
it
be
for
fornication,
and
shall
marry
another,
committeth
adultery:
and
whoso
marrieth
her
which
is
put
away
doth
commit
adultery.
019:010
His
disciples
say
unto
him,
If
the
case
of
the
man
be
so
with
his
wife,
it
is
not
good
to
marry.
019:011
But
he
said
unto
them,
All
men
cannot
receive
this
saying,
save
they
to
whom
it
is
given.
019:012
For
there
are
some
eunuchs,
which
were
so
born
from
their
mother's
womb:
and
there
are
some
eunuchs,
which
were
made
eunuchs
of
men:
and
there
be
eunuchs,
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven's
sake.
He
that
is
able
to
receive
it,
let
him
receive
it.
019:013
Then
were
there
brought
unto
him
little
children,
that
he
should
put
his
hands
on
them,
and
pray:
and
the
disciples
rebuked
them.
019:014
But
Jesus
said,
Suffer
little
children,
and
forbid
them
not,
to
come
unto
me:
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
019:015
And
he
laid
his
hands
on
them,
and
departed
thence.
019:016
And,
behold,
one
came
and
said
unto
him,
Good
Master,
what
good
thing
shall
I
do,
that
I
may
have
eternal
life?
019:017
And
he
said
unto
him,
Why
callest
thou
me
good?
there
is
none
good
but
one,
that
is,
God:
but
if
thou
wilt
enter
into
life,
keep
the
commandments.
019:018
He
saith
unto
him,
Which?
Jesus
said,
Thou
shalt
do
no
murder,
Thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery,
Thou
shalt
not
steal,
Thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness,
019:019
Honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother:
and,
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself.
019:020
The
young
man
saith
unto
him,
All
these
things
have
I
kept
from
my
youth
up:
what
lack
I
yet?
019:021
Jesus
said
unto
him,
If
thou
wilt
be
perfect,
go
and
sell
that
thou
hast,
and
give
to
the
poor,
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven:
and
come
and
follow
me.
019:022
But
when
the
young
man
heard
that
saying,
he
went
away
sorrowful:
for
he
had
great
possessions.
019:023
Then
said
Jesus
unto
his
disciples,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
That
a
rich
man
shall
hardly
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
019:024
And
again
I
say
unto
you,
It
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle,
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God.
019:025
When
his
disciples
heard
it,
they
were
exceedingly
amazed,
saying,
Who
then
can
be
saved?
019:026
But
Jesus
beheld
them,
and
said
unto
them,
With
men
this
is
impossible;
but
with
God
all
things
are
possible.
019:027
Then
answered
Peter
and
said
unto
him,
Behold,
we
have
forsaken
all,
and
followed
thee;
what
shall
we
have
therefore?
019:028
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
That
ye
which
have
followed
me,
in
the
regeneration
when
the
Son
of
man
shall
sit
in
the
throne
of
his
glory,
ye
also
shall
sit
upon
twelve
thrones,
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
Israel.
019:029
And
every
one
that
hath
forsaken
houses,
or
brethren,
or
sisters,
or
father,
or
mother,
or
wife,
or
children,
or
lands,
for
my
name's
sake,
shall
receive
an
hundredfold,
and
shall
inherit
everlasting
life.
019:030
But
many
that
are
first
shall
be
last;
and
the
last
shall
be
first.
020:001
For
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
that
is
an
householder,
which
went
out
early
in
the
morning
to
hire
labourers
into
his
vineyard.
020:002
And
when
he
had
agreed
with
the
labourers
for
a
penny
a
day,
he
sent
them
into
his
vineyard.
020:003
And
he
went
out
about
the
third
hour,
and
saw
others
standing
idle
in
the
marketplace,
020:004
And
said
unto
them;
Go
ye
also
into
the
vineyard,
and
whatsoever
is
right
I
will
give
you.
And
they
went
their
way.
020:005
Again
he
went
out
about
the
sixth
and
ninth
hour,
and
did
likewise.
020:006
And
about
the
eleventh
hour
he
went
out,
and
found
others
standing
idle,
and
saith
unto
them,
Why
stand
ye
here
all
the
day
idle?
020:007
They
say
unto
him,
Because
no
man
hath
hired
us.
He
saith
unto
them,
Go
ye
also
into
the
vineyard;
and
whatsoever
is
right,
that
shall
ye
receive.
020:008
So
when
even
was
come,
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
saith
unto
his
steward,
Call
the
labourers,
and
give
them
their
hire,
beginning
from
the
last
unto
the
first.
020:009
And
when
they
came
that
were
hired
about
the
eleventh
hour,
they
received
every
man
a
penny.
020:010
But
when
the
first
came,
they
supposed
that
they
should
have
received
more;
and
they
likewise
received
every
man
a
penny.
020:011
And
when
they
had
received
it,
they
murmured
against
the
goodman
of
the
house,
020:012
Saying,
These
last
have
wrought
but
one
hour,
and
thou
hast
made
them
equal
unto
us,
which
have
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day.
020:013
But
he
answered
one
of
them,
and
said,
Friend,
I
do
thee
no
wrong:
didst
not
thou
agree
with
me
for
a
penny?
020:014
Take
that
thine
is,
and
go
thy
way:
I
will
give
unto
this
last,
even
as
unto
thee.
020:015
Is
it
not
lawful
for
me
to
do
what
I
will
with
mine
own?
Is
thine
eye
evil,
because
I
am
good?
020:016
So
the
last
shall
be
first,
and
the
first
last:
for
many
be
called,
but
few
chosen.
020:017
And
Jesus
going
up
to
Jerusalem
took
the
twelve
disciples
apart
in
the
way,
and
said
unto
them,
020:018
Behold,
we
go
up
to
Jerusalem;
and
the
Son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
unto
the
chief
priests
and
unto
the
scribes,
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
death,
020:019
And
shall
deliver
him
to
the
Gentiles
to
mock,
and
to
scourge,
and
to
crucify
him:
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
again.
020:020
Then
came
to
him
the
mother
of
Zebedees
children
with
her
sons,
worshipping
him,
and
desiring
a
certain
thing
of
him.
020:021
And
he
said
unto
her,
What
wilt
thou?
She
saith
unto
him,
Grant
that
these
my
two
sons
may
sit,
the
one
on
thy
right
hand,
and
the
other
on
the
left,
in
thy
kingdom.
020:022
But
Jesus
answered
and
said,
Ye
know
not
what
ye
ask.
Are
ye
able
to
drink
of
the
cup
that
I
shall
drink
of,
and
to
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
I
am
baptized
with?
They
say
unto
him,
We
are
able.
020:023
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Ye
shall
drink
indeed
of
my
cup,
and
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
I
am
baptized
with:
but
to
sit
on
my
right
hand,
and
on
my
left,
is
not
mine
to
give,
but
it
shall
be
given
to
them
for
whom
it
is
prepared
of
my
Father.
020:024
And
when
the
ten
heard
it,
they
were
moved
with
indignation
against
the
two
brethren.
020:025
But
Jesus
called
them
unto
him,
and
said,
Ye
know
that
the
princes
of
the
Gentiles
exercise
dominion
over
them,
and
they
that
are
great
exercise
authority
upon
them.
020:026
But
it
shall
not
be
so
among
you:
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
you,
let
him
be
your
minister;
020:027
And
whosoever
will
be
chief
among
you,
let
him
be
your
servant:
020:028
Even
as
the
Son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
unto,
but
to
minister,
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
many.
020:029
And
as
they
departed
from
Jericho,
a
great
multitude
followed
him.
020:030
And,
behold,
two
blind
men
sitting
by
the
way
side,
when
they
heard
that
Jesus
passed
by,
cried
out,
saying,
Have
mercy
on
us,
O
Lord,
thou
son
of
David.
020:031
And
the
multitude
rebuked
them,
because
they
should
hold
their
peace:
but
they
cried
the
more,
saying,
Have
mercy
on
us,
O
Lord,
thou
son
of
David.
020:032
And
Jesus
stood
still,
and
called
them,
and
said,
What
will
ye
that
I
shall
do
unto
you?
020:033
They
say
unto
him,
Lord,
that
our
eyes
may
be
opened.
020:034
So
Jesus
had
compassion
on
them,
and
touched
their
eyes:
and
immediately
their
eyes
received
sight,
and
they
followed
him.
021:001
And
when
they
drew
nigh
unto
Jerusalem,
and
were
come
to
Bethphage,
unto
the
mount
of
Olives,
then
sent
Jesus
two
disciples,
021:002
Saying
unto
them,
Go
into
the
village
over
against
you,
and
straightway
ye
shall
find
an
ass
tied,
and
a
colt
with
her:
loose
them,
and
bring
them
unto
me.
021:003
And
if
any
man
say
ought
unto
you,
ye
shall
say,
The
Lord
hath
need
of
them;
and
straightway
he
will
send
them.
021:004
All
this
was
done,
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet,
saying,
021:005
Tell
ye
the
daughter
of
Sion,
Behold,
thy
King
cometh
unto
thee,
meek,
and
sitting
upon
an
ass,
and
a
colt
the
foal
of
an
ass.
021:006
And
the
disciples
went,
and
did
as
Jesus
commanded
them,
021:007
And
brought
the
ass,
and
the
colt,
and
put
on
them
their
clothes,
and
they
set
him
thereon.
021:008
And
a
very
great
multitude
spread
their
garments
in
the
way;
others
cut
down
branches
from
the
trees,
and
strawed
them
in
the
way.
021:009
And
the
multitudes
that
went
before,
and
that
followed,
cried,
saying,
Hosanna
to
the
son
of
David:
Blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Lord;
Hosanna
in
the
highest.
021:010
And
when
he
was
come
into
Jerusalem,
all
the
city
was
moved,
saying,
Who
is
this?
021:011
And
the
multitude
said,
This
is
Jesus
the
prophet
of
Nazareth
of
Galilee.
021:012
And
Jesus
went
into
the
temple
of
God,
and
cast
out
all
them
that
sold
and
bought
in
the
temple,
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
the
moneychangers,
and
the
seats
of
them
that
sold
doves,
021:013
And
said
unto
them,
It
is
written,
My
house
shall
be
called
the
house
of
prayer;
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves.
021:014
And
the
blind
and
the
lame
came
to
him
in
the
temple;
and
he
healed
them.
021:015
And
when
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
saw
the
wonderful
things
that
he
did,
and
the
children
crying
in
the
temple,
and
saying,
Hosanna
to
the
son
of
David;
they
were
sore
displeased,
021:016
And
said
unto
him,
Hearest
thou
what
these
say?
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Yea;
have
ye
never
read,
Out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
and
sucklings
thou
hast
perfected
praise?
021:017
And
he
left
them,
and
went
out
of
the
city
into
Bethany;
and
he
lodged
there.
021:018
Now
in
the
morning
as
he
returned
into
the
city,
he
hungered.
021:019
And
when
he
saw
a
fig
tree
in
the
way,
he
came
to
it,
and
found
nothing
thereon,
but
leaves
only,
and
said
unto
it,
Let
no
fruit
grow
on
thee
henceforward
for
ever.
And
presently
the
fig
tree
withered
away.
021:020
And
when
the
disciples
saw
it,
they
marvelled,
saying,
How
soon
is
the
fig
tree
withered
away!
021:021
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
If
ye
have
faith,
and
doubt
not,
ye
shall
not
only
do
this
which
is
done
to
the
fig
tree,
but
also
if
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain,
Be
thou
removed,
and
be
thou
cast
into
the
sea;
it
shall
be
done.
021:022
And
all
things,
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
prayer,
believing,
ye
shall
receive.
021:023
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
temple,
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
came
unto
him
as
he
was
teaching,
and
said,
By
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things?
and
who
gave
thee
this
authority?
021:024
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
I
also
will
ask
you
one
thing,
which
if
ye
tell
me,
I
in
like
wise
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things.
021:025
The
baptism
of
John,
whence
was
it?
from
heaven,
or
of
men?
And
they
reasoned
with
themselves,
saying,
If
we
shall
say,
From
heaven;
he
will
say
unto
us,
Why
did
ye
not
then
believe
him?
021:026
But
if
we
shall
say,
Of
men;
we
fear
the
people;
for
all
hold
John
as
a
prophet.
021:027
And
they
answered
Jesus,
and
said,
We
cannot
tell.
And
he
said
unto
them,
Neither
tell
I
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things.
021:028
But
what
think
ye?
A
certain
man
had
two
sons;
and
he
came
to
the
first,
and
said,
Son,
go
work
to
day
in
my
vineyard.
021:029
He
answered
and
said,
I
will
not:
but
afterward
he
repented,
and
went.
021:030
And
he
came
to
the
second,
and
said
likewise.
And
he
answered
and
said,
I
go,
sir:
and
went
not.
021:031
Whether
of
them
twain
did
the
will
of
his
father?
They
say
unto
him,
The
first.
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
That
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
go
into
the
kingdom
of
God
before
you.
021:032
For
John
came
unto
you
in
the
way
of
righteousness,
and
ye
believed
him
not:
but
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
believed
him:
and
ye,
when
ye
had
seen
it,
repented
not
afterward,
that
ye
might
believe
him.
021:033
Hear
another
parable:
There
was
a
certain
householder,
which
planted
a
vineyard,
and
hedged
it
round
about,
and
digged
a
winepress
in
it,
and
built
a
tower,
and
let
it
out
to
husbandmen,
and
went
into
a
far
country:
021:034
And
when
the
time
of
the
fruit
drew
near,
he
sent
his
servants
to
the
husbandmen,
that
they
might
receive
the
fruits
of
it.
021:035
And
the
husbandmen
took
his
servants,
and
beat
one,
and
killed
another,
and
stoned
another.
021:036
Again,
he
sent
other
servants
more
than
the
first:
and
they
did
unto
them
likewise.
021:037
But
last
of
all
he
sent
unto
them
his
son,
saying,
They
will
reverence
my
son.
021:038
But
when
the
husbandmen
saw
the
son,
they
said
among
themselves,
This
is
the
heir;
come,
let
us
kill
him,
and
let
us
seize
on
his
inheritance.
021:039
And
they
caught
him,
and
cast
him
out
of
the
vineyard,
and
slew
him.
021:040
When
the
lord
therefore
of
the
vineyard
cometh,
what
will
he
do
unto
those
husbandmen?
021:041
They
say
unto
him,
He
will
miserably
destroy
those
wicked
men,
and
will
let
out
his
vineyard
unto
other
husbandmen,
which
shall
render
him
the
fruits
in
their
seasons.
021:042
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Did
ye
never
read
in
the
scriptures,
The
stone
which
the
builders
rejected,
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner:
this
is
the
Lord's
doing,
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
eyes?
021:043
Therefore
say
I
unto
you,
The
kingdom
of
God
shall
be
taken
from
you,
and
given
to
a
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
thereof.
021:044
And
whosoever
shall
fall
on
this
stone
shall
be
broken:
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall,
it
will
grind
him
to
powder.
021:045
And
when
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees
had
heard
his
parables,
they
perceived
that
he
spake
of
them.
021:046
But
when
they
sought
to
lay
hands
on
him,
they
feared
the
multitude,
because
they
took
him
for
a
prophet.
022:001
And
Jesus
answered
and
spake
unto
them
again
by
parables,
and
said,
022:002
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
certain
king,
which
made
a
marriage
for
his
son,
022:003
And
sent
forth
his
servants
to
call
them
that
were
bidden
to
the
wedding:
and
they
would
not
come.
022:004
Again,
he
sent
forth
other
servants,
saying,
Tell
them
which
are
bidden,
Behold,
I
have
prepared
my
dinner:
my
oxen
and
my
fatlings
are
killed,
and
all
things
are
ready:
come
unto
the
marriage.
022:005
But
they
made
light
of
it,
and
went
their
ways,
one
to
his
farm,
another
to
his
merchandise:
022:006
And
the
remnant
took
his
servants,
and
entreated
them
spitefully,
and
slew
them.
022:007
But
when
the
king
heard
thereof,
he
was
wroth:
and
he
sent
forth
his
armies,
and
destroyed
those
murderers,
and
burned
up
their
city.
022:008
Then
saith
he
to
his
servants,
The
wedding
is
ready,
but
they
which
were
bidden
were
not
worthy.
022:009
Go
ye
therefore
into
the
highways,
and
as
many
as
ye
shall
find,
bid
to
the
marriage.
022:010
So
those
servants
went
out
into
the
highways,
and
gathered
together
all
as
many
as
they
found,
both
bad
and
good:
and
the
wedding
was
furnished
with
guests.
022:011
And
when
the
king
came
in
to
see
the
guests,
he
saw
there
a
man
which
had
not
on
a
wedding
garment:
022:012
And
he
saith
unto
him,
Friend,
how
camest
thou
in
hither
not
having
a
wedding
garment?
And
he
was
speechless.
022:013
Then
said
the
king
to
the
servants,
Bind
him
hand
and
foot,
and
take
him
away,
and
cast
him
into
outer
darkness,
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth.
022:014
For
many
are
called,
but
few
are
chosen.
022:015
Then
went
the
Pharisees,
and
took
counsel
how
they
might
entangle
him
in
his
talk.
022:016
And
they
sent
out
unto
him
their
disciples
with
the
Herodians,
saying,
Master,
we
know
that
thou
art
true,
and
teachest
the
way
of
God
in
truth,
neither
carest
thou
for
any
man:
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
men.
022:017
Tell
us
therefore,
What
thinkest
thou?
Is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
unto
Caesar,
or
not?
022:018
But
Jesus
perceived
their
wickedness,
and
said,
Why
tempt
ye
me,
ye
hypocrites?
022:019
Shew
me
the
tribute
money.
And
they
brought
unto
him
a
penny.
022:020
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Whose
is
this
image
and
superscription?
022:021
They
say
unto
him,
Caesar's.
Then
saith
he
unto
them,
Render
therefore
unto
Caesar
the
things
which
are
Caesar's;
and
unto
God
the
things
that
are
God's.
022:022
When
they
had
heard
these
words,
they
marvelled,
and
left
him,
and
went
their
way.
022:023
The
same
day
came
to
him
the
Sadducees,
which
say
that
there
is
no
resurrection,
and
asked
him,
022:024
Saying,
Master,
Moses
said,
If
a
man
die,
having
no
children,
his
brother
shall
marry
his
wife,
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
brother.
022:025
Now
there
were
with
us
seven
brethren:
and
the
first,
when
he
had
married
a
wife,
deceased,
and,
having
no
issue,
left
his
wife
unto
his
brother:
022:026
Likewise
the
second
also,
and
the
third,
unto
the
seventh.
022:027
And
last
of
all
the
woman
died
also.
022:028
Therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
the
seven?
for
they
all
had
her.
022:029
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Ye
do
err,
not
knowing
the
scriptures,
nor
the
power
of
God.
022:030
For
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
marry,
nor
are
given
in
marriage,
but
are
as
the
angels
of
God
in
heaven.
022:031
But
as
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead,
have
ye
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
by
God,
saying,
022:032
I
am
the
God
of
Abraham,
and
the
God
of
Isaac,
and
the
God
of
Jacob?
God
is
not
the
God
of
the
dead,
but
of
the
living.
022:033
And
when
the
multitude
heard
this,
they
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine.
022:034
But
when
the
Pharisees
had
heard
that
he
had
put
the
Sadducees
to
silence,
they
were
gathered
together.
022:035
Then
one
of
them,
which
was
a
lawyer,
asked
him
a
question,
tempting
him,
and
saying,
022:036
Master,
which
is
the
great
commandment
in
the
law?
022:037
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Thou
shalt
love
the
Lord
thy
God
with
all
thy
heart,
and
with
all
thy
soul,
and
with
all
thy
mind.
022:038
This
is
the
first
and
great
commandment.
022:039
And
the
second
is
like
unto
it,
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself.
022:040
On
these
two
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
prophets.
022:041
While
the
Pharisees
were
gathered
together,
Jesus
asked
them,
022:042
Saying,
What
think
ye
of
Christ?
whose
son
is
he?
They
say
unto
him,
The
son
of
David.
022:043
He
saith
unto
them,
How
then
doth
David
in
spirit
call
him
Lord,
saying,
022:044
The
LORD
said
unto
my
Lord,
Sit
thou
on
my
right
hand,
till
I
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool?
022:045
If
David
then
call
him
Lord,
how
is
he
his
son?
022:046
And
no
man
was
able
to
answer
him
a
word,
neither
durst
any
man
from
that
day
forth
ask
him
any
more
questions.
023:001
Then
spake
Jesus
to
the
multitude,
and
to
his
disciples,
023:002
Saying
The
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
sit
in
Moses'
seat:
023:003
All
therefore
whatsoever
they
bid
you
observe,
that
observe
and
do;
but
do
not
ye
after
their
works:
for
they
say,
and
do
not.
023:004
For
they
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne,
and
lay
them
on
men's
shoulders;
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
fingers.
023:005
But
all
their
works
they
do
for
to
be
seen
of
men:
they
make
broad
their
phylacteries,
and
enlarge
the
borders
of
their
garments,
023:006
And
love
the
uppermost
rooms
at
feasts,
and
the
chief
seats
in
the
synagogues,
023:007
And
greetings
in
the
markets,
and
to
be
called
of
men,
Rabbi,
Rabbi.
023:008
But
be
not
ye
called
Rabbi:
for
one
is
your
Master,
even
Christ;
and
all
ye
are
brethren.
023:009
And
call
no
man
your
father
upon
the
earth:
for
one
is
your
Father,
which
is
in
heaven.
023:010
Neither
be
ye
called
masters:
for
one
is
your
Master,
even
Christ.
023:011
But
he
that
is
greatest
among
you
shall
be
your
servant.
023:012
And
whosoever
shall
exalt
himself
shall
be
abased;
and
he
that
shall
humble
himself
shall
be
exalted.
023:013
But
woe
unto
you,
scribes
and
Pharisees,
hypocrites!
for
ye
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
men:
for
ye
neither
go
in
yourselves,
neither
suffer
ye
them
that
are
entering
to
go
in.
023:014
Woe
unto
you,
scribes
and
Pharisees,
hypocrites!
for
ye
devour
widows'
houses,
and
for
a
pretence
make
long
prayer:
therefore
ye
shall
receive
the
greater
damnation.
023:015
Woe
unto
you,
scribes
and
Pharisees,
hypocrites!
for
ye
compass
sea
and
land
to
make
one
proselyte,
and
when
he
is
made,
ye
make
him
twofold
more
the
child
of
hell
than
yourselves.
023:016
Woe
unto
you,
ye
blind
guides,
which
say,
Whosoever
shall
swear
by
the
temple,
it
is
nothing;
but
whosoever
shall
swear
by
the
gold
of
the
temple,
he
is
a
debtor!
023:017
Ye
fools
and
blind:
for
whether
is
greater,
the
gold,
or
the
temple
that
sanctifieth
the
gold?
023:018
And,
Whosoever
shall
swear
by
the
altar,
it
is
nothing;
but
whosoever
sweareth
by
the
gift
that
is
upon
it,
he
is
guilty.
023:019
Ye
fools
and
blind:
for
whether
is
greater,
the
gift,
or
the
altar
that
sanctifieth
the
gift?
023:020
Whoso
therefore
shall
swear
by
