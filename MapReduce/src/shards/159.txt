the
altar,
sweareth
by
it,
and
by
all
things
thereon.
023:021
And
whoso
shall
swear
by
the
temple,
sweareth
by
it,
and
by
him
that
dwelleth
therein.
023:022
And
he
that
shall
swear
by
heaven,
sweareth
by
the
throne
of
God,
and
by
him
that
sitteth
thereon.
023:023
Woe
unto
you,
scribes
and
Pharisees,
hypocrites!
for
ye
pay
tithe
of
mint
and
anise
and
cummin,
and
have
omitted
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law,
judgment,
mercy,
and
faith:
these
ought
ye
to
have
done,
and
not
to
leave
the
other
undone.
023:024
Ye
blind
guides,
which
strain
at
a
gnat,
and
swallow
a
camel.
023:025
Woe
unto
you,
scribes
and
Pharisees,
hypocrites!
for
ye
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
of
the
platter,
but
within
they
are
full
of
extortion
and
excess.
023:026
Thou
blind
Pharisee,
cleanse
first
that
which
is
within
the
cup
and
platter,
that
the
outside
of
them
may
be
clean
also.
023:027
Woe
unto
you,
scribes
and
Pharisees,
hypocrites!
for
ye
are
like
unto
whited
sepulchres,
which
indeed
appear
beautiful
outward,
but
are
within
full
of
dead
men's
bones,
and
of
all
uncleanness.
023:028
Even
so
ye
also
outwardly
appear
righteous
unto
men,
but
within
ye
are
full
of
hypocrisy
and
iniquity.
023:029
Woe
unto
you,
scribes
and
Pharisees,
hypocrites!
because
ye
build
the
tombs
of
the
prophets,
and
garnish
the
sepulchres
of
the
righteous,
023:030
And
say,
If
we
had
been
in
the
days
of
our
fathers,
we
would
not
have
been
partakers
with
them
in
the
blood
of
the
prophets.
023:031
Wherefore
ye
be
witnesses
unto
yourselves,
that
ye
are
the
children
of
them
which
killed
the
prophets.
023:032
Fill
ye
up
then
the
measure
of
your
fathers.
023:033
Ye
serpents,
ye
generation
of
vipers,
how
can
ye
escape
the
damnation
of
hell?
023:034
Wherefore,
behold,
I
send
unto
you
prophets,
and
wise
men,
and
scribes:
and
some
of
them
ye
shall
kill
and
crucify;
and
some
of
them
shall
ye
scourge
in
your
synagogues,
and
persecute
them
from
city
to
city:
023:035
That
upon
you
may
come
all
the
righteous
blood
shed
upon
the
earth,
from
the
blood
of
righteous
Abel
unto
the
blood
of
Zacharias
son
of
Barachias,
whom
ye
slew
between
the
temple
and
the
altar.
023:036
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
All
these
things
shall
come
upon
this
generation.
023:037
O
Jerusalem,
Jerusalem,
thou
that
killest
the
prophets,
and
stonest
them
which
are
sent
unto
thee,
how
often
would
I
have
gathered
thy
children
together,
even
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings,
and
ye
would
not!
023:038
Behold,
your
house
is
left
unto
you
desolate.
023:039
For
I
say
unto
you,
Ye
shall
not
see
me
henceforth,
till
ye
shall
say,
Blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Lord.
024:001
And
Jesus
went
out,
and
departed
from
the
temple:
and
his
disciples
came
to
him
for
to
shew
him
the
buildings
of
the
temple.
024:002
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
See
ye
not
all
these
things?
verily
I
say
unto
you,
There
shall
not
be
left
here
one
stone
upon
another,
that
shall
not
be
thrown
down.
024:003
And
as
he
sat
upon
the
mount
of
Olives,
the
disciples
came
unto
him
privately,
saying,
Tell
us,
when
shall
these
things
be?
and
what
shall
be
the
sign
of
thy
coming,
and
of
the
end
of
the
world?
024:004
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Take
heed
that
no
man
deceive
you.
024:005
For
many
shall
come
in
my
name,
saying,
I
am
Christ;
and
shall
deceive
many.
024:006
And
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
rumours
of
wars:
see
that
ye
be
not
troubled:
for
all
these
things
must
come
to
pass,
but
the
end
is
not
yet.
024:007
For
nation
shall
rise
against
nation,
and
kingdom
against
kingdom:
and
there
shall
be
famines,
and
pestilences,
and
earthquakes,
in
divers
places.
024:008
All
these
are
the
beginning
of
sorrows.
024:009
Then
shall
they
deliver
you
up
to
be
afflicted,
and
shall
kill
you:
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
nations
for
my
name's
sake.
024:010
And
then
shall
many
be
offended,
and
shall
betray
one
another,
and
shall
hate
one
another.
024:011
And
many
false
prophets
shall
rise,
and
shall
deceive
many.
024:012
And
because
iniquity
shall
abound,
the
love
of
many
shall
wax
cold.
024:013
But
he
that
shall
endure
unto
the
end,
the
same
shall
be
saved.
024:014
And
this
gospel
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
preached
in
all
the
world
for
a
witness
unto
all
nations;
and
then
shall
the
end
come.
024:015
When
ye
therefore
shall
see
the
abomination
of
desolation,
spoken
of
by
Daniel
the
prophet,
stand
in
the
holy
place,
(whoso
readeth,
let
him
understand:)
024:016
Then
let
them
which
be
in
Judaea
flee
into
the
mountains:
024:017
Let
him
which
is
on
the
housetop
not
come
down
to
take
any
thing
out
of
his
house:
024:018
Neither
let
him
which
is
in
the
field
return
back
to
take
his
clothes.
024:019
And
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
child,
and
to
them
that
give
suck
in
those
days!
024:020
But
pray
ye
that
your
flight
be
not
in
the
winter,
neither
on
the
sabbath
day:
024:021
For
then
shall
be
great
tribulation,
such
as
was
not
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
this
time,
no,
nor
ever
shall
be.
024:022
And
except
those
days
should
be
shortened,
there
should
no
flesh
be
saved:
but
for
the
elect's
sake
those
days
shall
be
shortened.
024:023
Then
if
any
man
shall
say
unto
you,
Lo,
here
is
Christ,
or
there;
believe
it
not.
024:024
For
there
shall
arise
false
Christs,
and
false
prophets,
and
shall
shew
great
signs
and
wonders;
insomuch
that,
if
it
were
possible,
they
shall
deceive
the
very
elect.
024:025
Behold,
I
have
told
you
before.
024:026
Wherefore
if
they
shall
say
unto
you,
Behold,
he
is
in
the
desert;
go
not
forth:
behold,
he
is
in
the
secret
chambers;
believe
it
not.
024:027
For
as
the
lightning
cometh
out
of
the
east,
and
shineth
even
unto
the
west;
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
Son
of
man
be.
024:028
For
wheresoever
the
carcase
is,
there
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
together.
024:029
Immediately
after
the
tribulation
of
those
days
shall
the
sun
be
darkened,
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light,
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven,
and
the
powers
of
the
heavens
shall
be
shaken:
024:030
And
then
shall
appear
the
sign
of
the
Son
of
man
in
heaven:
and
then
shall
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
mourn,
and
they
shall
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
glory.
024:031
And
he
shall
send
his
angels
with
a
great
sound
of
a
trumpet,
and
they
shall
gather
together
his
elect
from
the
four
winds,
from
one
end
of
heaven
to
the
other.
024:032
Now
learn
a
parable
of
the
fig
tree;
When
his
branch
is
yet
tender,
and
putteth
forth
leaves,
ye
know
that
summer
is
nigh:
024:033
So
likewise
ye,
when
ye
shall
see
all
these
things,
know
that
it
is
near,
even
at
the
doors.
024:034
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
This
generation
shall
not
pass,
till
all
these
things
be
fulfilled.
024:035
Heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away,
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
away.
024:036
But
of
that
day
and
hour
knoweth
no
man,
no,
not
the
angels
of
heaven,
but
my
Father
only.
024:037
But
as
the
days
of
Noe
were,
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
Son
of
man
be.
024:038
For
as
in
the
days
that
were
before
the
flood
they
were
eating
and
drinking,
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage,
until
the
day
that
Noe
entered
into
the
ark,
024:039
And
knew
not
until
the
flood
came,
and
took
them
all
away;
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
Son
of
man
be.
024:040
Then
shall
two
be
in
the
field;
the
one
shall
be
taken,
and
the
other
left.
024:041
Two
women
shall
be
grinding
at
the
mill;
the
one
shall
be
taken,
and
the
other
left.
024:042
Watch
therefore:
for
ye
know
not
what
hour
your
Lord
doth
come.
024:043
But
know
this,
that
if
the
goodman
of
the
house
had
known
in
what
watch
the
thief
would
come,
he
would
have
watched,
and
would
not
have
suffered
his
house
to
be
broken
up.
024:044
Therefore
be
ye
also
ready:
for
in
such
an
hour
as
ye
think
not
the
Son
of
man
cometh.
024:045
Who
then
is
a
faithful
and
wise
servant,
whom
his
lord
hath
made
ruler
over
his
household,
to
give
them
meat
in
due
season?
024:046
Blessed
is
that
servant,
whom
his
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
so
doing.
024:047
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
That
he
shall
make
him
ruler
over
all
his
goods.
024:048
But
and
if
that
evil
servant
shall
say
in
his
heart,
My
lord
delayeth
his
coming;
024:049
And
shall
begin
to
smite
his
fellowservants,
and
to
eat
and
drink
with
the
drunken;
024:050
The
lord
of
that
servant
shall
come
in
a
day
when
he
looketh
not
for
him,
and
in
an
hour
that
he
is
not
aware
of,
024:051
And
shall
cut
him
asunder,
and
appoint
him
his
portion
with
the
hypocrites:
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth.
025:001
Then
shall
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
likened
unto
ten
virgins,
which
took
their
lamps,
and
went
forth
to
meet
the
bridegroom.
025:002
And
five
of
them
were
wise,
and
five
were
foolish.
025:003
They
that
were
foolish
took
their
lamps,
and
took
no
oil
with
them:
025:004
But
the
wise
took
oil
in
their
vessels
with
their
lamps.
025:005
While
the
bridegroom
tarried,
they
all
slumbered
and
slept.
025:006
And
at
midnight
there
was
a
cry
made,
Behold,
the
bridegroom
cometh;
go
ye
out
to
meet
him.
025:007
Then
all
those
virgins
arose,
and
trimmed
their
lamps.
025:008
And
the
foolish
said
unto
the
wise,
Give
us
of
your
oil;
for
our
lamps
are
gone
out.
025:009
But
the
wise
answered,
saying,
Not
so;
lest
there
be
not
enough
for
us
and
you:
but
go
ye
rather
to
them
that
sell,
and
buy
for
yourselves.
025:010
And
while
they
went
to
buy,
the
bridegroom
came;
and
they
that
were
ready
went
in
with
him
to
the
marriage:
and
the
door
was
shut.
025:011
Afterward
came
also
the
other
virgins,
saying,
Lord,
Lord,
open
to
us.
025:012
But
he
answered
and
said,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
I
know
you
not.
025:013
Watch
therefore,
for
ye
know
neither
the
day
nor
the
hour
wherein
the
Son
of
man
cometh.
025:014
For
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
as
a
man
travelling
into
a
far
country,
who
called
his
own
servants,
and
delivered
unto
them
his
goods.
025:015
And
unto
one
he
gave
five
talents,
to
another
two,
and
to
another
one;
to
every
man
according
to
his
several
ability;
and
straightway
took
his
journey.
025:016
Then
he
that
had
received
the
five
talents
went
and
traded
with
the
same,
and
made
them
other
five
talents.
025:017
And
likewise
he
that
had
received
two,
he
also
gained
other
two.
025:018
But
he
that
had
received
one
went
and
digged
in
the
earth,
and
hid
his
lord's
money.
025:019
After
a
long
time
the
lord
of
those
servants
cometh,
and
reckoneth
with
them.
025:020
And
so
he
that
had
received
five
talents
came
and
brought
other
five
talents,
saying,
Lord,
thou
deliveredst
unto
me
five
talents:
behold,
I
have
gained
beside
them
five
talents
more.
025:021
His
lord
said
unto
him,
Well
done,
thou
good
and
faithful
servant:
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
things,
I
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
things:
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy
lord.
025:022
He
also
that
had
received
two
talents
came
and
said,
Lord,
thou
deliveredst
unto
me
two
talents:
behold,
I
have
gained
two
other
talents
beside
them.
025:023
His
lord
said
unto
him,
Well
done,
good
and
faithful
servant;
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
things,
I
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
things:
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy
lord.
025:024
Then
he
which
had
received
the
one
talent
came
and
said,
Lord,
I
knew
thee
that
thou
art
an
hard
man,
reaping
where
thou
hast
not
sown,
and
gathering
where
thou
hast
not
strawed:
025:025
And
I
was
afraid,
and
went
and
hid
thy
talent
in
the
earth:
lo,
there
thou
hast
that
is
thine.
025:026
His
lord
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Thou
wicked
and
slothful
servant,
thou
knewest
that
I
reap
where
I
sowed
not,
and
gather
where
I
have
not
strawed:
025:027
Thou
oughtest
therefore
to
have
put
my
money
to
the
exchangers,
and
then
at
my
coming
I
should
have
received
mine
own
with
usury.
025:028
Take
therefore
the
talent
from
him,
and
give
it
unto
him
which
hath
ten
talents.
025:029
For
unto
every
one
that
hath
shall
be
given,
and
he
shall
have
abundance:
but
from
him
that
hath
not
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
which
he
hath.
025:030
And
cast
ye
the
unprofitable
servant
into
outer
darkness:
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth.
025:031
When
the
Son
of
man
shall
come
in
his
glory,
and
all
the
holy
angels
with
him,
then
shall
he
sit
upon
the
throne
of
his
glory:
025:032
And
before
him
shall
be
gathered
all
nations:
and
he
shall
separate
them
one
from
another,
as
a
shepherd
divideth
his
sheep
from
the
goats:
025:033
And
he
shall
set
the
sheep
on
his
right
hand,
but
the
goats
on
the
left.
025:034
Then
shall
the
King
say
unto
them
on
his
right
hand,
Come,
ye
blessed
of
my
Father,
inherit
the
kingdom
prepared
for
you
from
the
foundation
of
the
world:
025:035
For
I
was
an
hungred,
and
ye
gave
me
meat:
I
was
thirsty,
and
ye
gave
me
drink:
I
was
a
stranger,
and
ye
took
me
in:
025:036
Naked,
and
ye
clothed
me:
I
was
sick,
and
ye
visited
me:
I
was
in
prison,
and
ye
came
unto
me.
025:037
Then
shall
the
righteous
answer
him,
saying,
Lord,
when
saw
we
thee
an
hungred,
and
fed
thee?
or
thirsty,
and
gave
thee
drink?
025:038
When
saw
we
thee
a
stranger,
and
took
thee
in?
or
naked,
and
clothed
thee?
025:039
Or
when
saw
we
thee
sick,
or
in
prison,
and
came
unto
thee?
025:040
And
the
King
shall
answer
and
say
unto
them,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren,
ye
have
done
it
unto
me.
025:041
Then
shall
he
say
also
unto
them
on
the
left
hand,
Depart
from
me,
ye
cursed,
into
everlasting
fire,
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels:
025:042
For
I
was
an
hungred,
and
ye
gave
me
no
meat:
I
was
thirsty,
and
ye
gave
me
no
drink:
025:043
I
was
a
stranger,
and
ye
took
me
not
in:
naked,
and
ye
clothed
me
not:
sick,
and
in
prison,
and
ye
visited
me
not.
025:044
Then
shall
they
also
answer
him,
saying,
Lord,
when
saw
we
thee
an
hungred,
or
athirst,
or
a
stranger,
or
naked,
or
sick,
or
in
prison,
and
did
not
minister
unto
thee?
025:045
Then
shall
he
answer
them,
saying,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Inasmuch
as
ye
did
it
not
to
one
of
the
least
of
these,
ye
did
it
not
to
me.
025:046
And
these
shall
go
away
into
everlasting
punishment:
but
the
righteous
into
life
eternal.
026:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Jesus
had
finished
all
these
sayings,
he
said
unto
his
disciples,
026:002
Ye
know
that
after
two
days
is
the
feast
of
the
passover,
and
the
Son
of
man
is
betrayed
to
be
crucified.
026:003
Then
assembled
together
the
chief
priests,
and
the
scribes,
and
the
elders
of
the
people,
unto
the
palace
of
the
high
priest,
who
was
called
Caiaphas,
026:004
And
consulted
that
they
might
take
Jesus
by
subtilty,
and
kill
him.
026:005
But
they
said,
Not
on
the
feast
day,
lest
there
be
an
uproar
among
the
people.
026:006
Now
when
Jesus
was
in
Bethany,
in
the
house
of
Simon
the
leper,
026:007
There
came
unto
him
a
woman
having
an
alabaster
box
of
very
precious
ointment,
and
poured
it
on
his
head,
as
he
sat
at
meat.
026:008
But
when
his
disciples
saw
it,
they
had
indignation,
saying,
To
what
purpose
is
this
waste?
026:009
For
this
ointment
might
have
been
sold
for
much,
and
given
to
the
poor.
026:010
When
Jesus
understood
it,
he
said
unto
them,
Why
trouble
ye
the
woman?
for
she
hath
wrought
a
good
work
upon
me.
026:011
For
ye
have
the
poor
always
with
you;
but
me
ye
have
not
always.
026:012
For
in
that
she
hath
poured
this
ointment
on
my
body,
she
did
it
for
my
burial.
026:013
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
in
the
whole
world,
there
shall
also
this,
that
this
woman
hath
done,
be
told
for
a
memorial
of
her.
026:014
Then
one
of
the
twelve,
called
Judas
Iscariot,
went
unto
the
chief
priests,
026:015
And
said
unto
them,
What
will
ye
give
me,
and
I
will
deliver
him
unto
you?
And
they
covenanted
with
him
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver.
026:016
And
from
that
time
he
sought
opportunity
to
betray
him.
026:017
Now
the
first
day
of
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
the
disciples
came
to
Jesus,
saying
unto
him,
Where
wilt
thou
that
we
prepare
for
thee
to
eat
the
passover?
026:018
And
he
said,
Go
into
the
city
to
such
a
man,
and
say
unto
him,
The
Master
saith,
My
time
is
at
hand;
I
will
keep
the
passover
at
thy
house
with
my
disciples.
026:019
And
the
disciples
did
as
Jesus
had
appointed
them;
and
they
made
ready
the
passover.
026:020
Now
when
the
even
was
come,
he
sat
down
with
the
twelve.
026:021
And
as
they
did
eat,
he
said,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
me.
026:022
And
they
were
exceeding
sorrowful,
and
began
every
one
of
them
to
say
unto
him,
Lord,
is
it
I?
026:023
And
he
answered
and
said,
He
that
dippeth
his
hand
with
me
in
the
dish,
the
same
shall
betray
me.
026:024
The
Son
of
man
goeth
as
it
is
written
of
him:
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
the
Son
of
man
is
betrayed!
it
had
been
good
for
that
man
if
he
had
not
been
born.
026:025
Then
Judas,
which
betrayed
him,
answered
and
said,
Master,
is
it
I?
He
said
unto
him,
Thou
hast
said.
026:026
And
as
they
were
eating,
Jesus
took
bread,
and
blessed
it,
and
brake
it,
and
gave
it
to
the
disciples,
and
said,
Take,
eat;
this
is
my
body.
026:027
And
he
took
the
cup,
and
gave
thanks,
and
gave
it
to
them,
saying,
Drink
ye
all
of
it;
026:028
For
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament,
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of
sins.
026:029
But
I
say
unto
you,
I
will
not
drink
henceforth
of
this
fruit
of
the
vine,
until
that
day
when
I
drink
it
new
with
you
in
my
Father's
kingdom.
026:030
And
when
they
had
sung
an
hymn,
they
went
out
into
the
mount
of
Olives.
026:031
Then
saith
Jesus
unto
them,
All
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
night:
for
it
is
written,
I
will
smite
the
shepherd,
and
the
sheep
of
the
flock
shall
be
scattered
abroad.
026:032
But
after
I
am
risen
again,
I
will
go
before
you
into
Galilee.
026:033
Peter
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Though
all
men
shall
be
offended
because
of
thee,
yet
will
I
never
be
offended.
026:034
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Verily
I
say
unto
thee,
That
this
night,
before
the
cock
crow,
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice.
026:035
Peter
said
unto
him,
Though
I
should
die
with
thee,
yet
will
I
not
deny
thee.
Likewise
also
said
all
the
disciples.
026:036
Then
cometh
Jesus
with
them
unto
a
place
called
Gethsemane,
and
saith
unto
the
disciples,
Sit
ye
here,
while
I
go
and
pray
yonder.
026:037
And
he
took
with
him
Peter
and
the
two
sons
of
Zebedee,
and
began
to
be
sorrowful
and
very
heavy.
026:038
Then
saith
he
unto
them,
My
soul
is
exceeding
sorrowful,
even
unto
death:
tarry
ye
here,
and
watch
with
me.
026:039
And
he
went
a
little
farther,
and
fell
on
his
face,
and
prayed,
saying,
O
my
Father,
if
it
be
possible,
let
this
cup
pass
from
me:
nevertheless
not
as
I
will,
but
as
thou
wilt.
026:040
And
he
cometh
unto
the
disciples,
and
findeth
them
asleep,
and
saith
unto
Peter,
What,
could
ye
not
watch
with
me
one
hour?
026:041
Watch
and
pray,
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation:
the
spirit
indeed
is
willing,
but
the
flesh
is
weak.
026:042
He
went
away
again
the
second
time,
and
prayed,
saying,
O
my
Father,
if
this
cup
may
not
pass
away
from
me,
except
I
drink
it,
thy
will
be
done.
026:043
And
he
came
and
found
them
asleep
again:
for
their
eyes
were
heavy.
026:044
And
he
left
them,
and
went
away
again,
and
prayed
the
third
time,
saying
the
same
words.
026:045
Then
cometh
he
to
his
disciples,
and
saith
unto
them,
Sleep
on
now,
and
take
your
rest:
behold,
the
hour
is
at
hand,
and
the
Son
of
man
is
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
sinners.
026:046
Rise,
let
us
be
going:
behold,
he
is
at
hand
that
doth
betray
me.
026:047
And
while
he
yet
spake,
lo,
Judas,
one
of
the
twelve,
came,
and
with
him
a
great
multitude
with
swords
and
staves,
from
the
chief
priests
and
elders
of
the
people.
026:048
Now
he
that
betrayed
him
gave
them
a
sign,
saying,
Whomsoever
I
shall
kiss,
that
same
is
he:
hold
him
fast.
026:049
And
forthwith
he
came
to
Jesus,
and
said,
Hail,
master;
and
kissed
him.
026:050
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Friend,
wherefore
art
thou
come?
Then
came
they,
and
laid
hands
on
Jesus
and
took
him.
026:051
And,
behold,
one
of
them
which
were
with
Jesus
stretched
out
his
hand,
and
drew
his
sword,
and
struck
a
servant
of
the
high
priest's,
and
smote
off
his
ear.
026:052
Then
said
Jesus
unto
him,
Put
up
again
thy
sword
into
his
place:
for
all
they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
sword.
026:053
Thinkest
thou
that
I
cannot
now
pray
to
my
Father,
and
he
shall
presently
give
me
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels?
026:054
But
how
then
shall
the
scriptures
be
fulfilled,
that
thus
it
must
be?
026:055
In
that
same
hour
said
Jesus
to
the
multitudes,
Are
ye
come
out
as
against
a
thief
with
swords
and
staves
for
to
take
me?
I
sat
daily
with
you
teaching
in
the
temple,
and
ye
laid
no
hold
on
me.
026:056
But
all
this
was
done,
that
the
scriptures
of
the
prophets
might
be
fulfilled.
Then
all
the
disciples
forsook
him,
and
fled.
026:057
And
they
that
had
laid
hold
on
Jesus
led
him
away
to
Caiaphas
the
high
priest,
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were
assembled.
026:058
But
Peter
followed
him
afar
off
unto
the
high
priest's
palace,
and
went
in,
and
sat
with
the
servants,
to
see
the
end.
026:059
Now
the
chief
priests,
and
elders,
and
all
the
council,
sought
false
witness
against
Jesus,
to
put
him
to
death;
026:060
But
found
none:
yea,
though
many
false
witnesses
came,
yet
found
they
none.
At
the
last
came
two
false
witnesses,
026:061
And
said,
This
fellow
said,
I
am
able
to
destroy
the
temple
of
God,
and
to
build
it
in
three
days.
026:062
And
the
high
priest
arose,
and
said
unto
him,
Answerest
thou
nothing?
what
is
it
which
these
witness
against
thee?
026:063
But
Jesus
held
his
peace,
And
the
high
priest
answered
and
said
unto
him,
I
adjure
thee
by
the
living
God,
that
thou
tell
us
whether
thou
be
the
Christ,
the
Son
of
God.
026:064
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
Thou
hast
said:
nevertheless
I
say
unto
you,
Hereafter
shall
ye
see
the
Son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
power,
and
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven.
026:065
Then
the
high
priest
rent
his
clothes,
saying,
He
hath
spoken
blasphemy;
what
further
need
have
we
of
