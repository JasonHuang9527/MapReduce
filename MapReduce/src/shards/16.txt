may
work
be
done;
but
in
the
seventh
is
the
sabbath
of
rest,
holy
to
the
LORD:
whosoever
doeth
any
work
in
the
sabbath
day,
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
031:016
Wherefore
the
children
of
Israel
shall
keep
the
sabbath,
to
observe
the
sabbath
throughout
their
generations,
for
a
perpetual
covenant.
031:017
It
is
a
sign
between
me
and
the
children
of
Israel
for
ever:
for
in
six
days
the
LORD
made
heaven
and
earth,
and
on
the
seventh
day
he
rested,
and
was
refreshed.
031:018
And
he
gave
unto
Moses,
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
communing
with
him
upon
mount
Sinai,
two
tables
of
testimony,
tables
of
stone,
written
with
the
finger
of
God.
032:001
And
when
the
people
saw
that
Moses
delayed
to
come
down
out
of
the
mount,
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
unto
Aaron,
and
said
unto
him,
Up,
make
us
gods,
which
shall
go
before
us;
for
as
for
this
Moses,
the
man
that
brought
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
him.
032:002
And
Aaron
said
unto
them,
Break
off
the
golden
earrings,
which
are
in
the
ears
of
your
wives,
of
your
sons,
and
of
your
daughters,
and
bring
them
unto
me.
032:003
And
all
the
people
brake
off
the
golden
earrings
which
were
in
their
ears,
and
brought
them
unto
Aaron.
032:004
And
he
received
them
at
their
hand,
and
fashioned
it
with
a
graving
tool,
after
he
had
made
it
a
molten
calf:
and
they
said,
These
be
thy
gods,
O
Israel,
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
032:005
And
when
Aaron
saw
it,
he
built
an
altar
before
it;
and
Aaron
made
proclamation,
and
said,
To
morrow
is
a
feast
to
the
LORD.
032:006
And
they
rose
up
early
on
the
morrow,
and
offered
burnt
offerings,
and
brought
peace
offerings;
and
the
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
to
drink,
and
rose
up
to
play.
032:007
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Go,
get
thee
down;
for
thy
people,
which
thou
broughtest
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
have
corrupted
themselves:
032:008
They
have
turned
aside
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
I
commanded
them:
they
have
made
them
a
molten
calf,
and
have
worshipped
it,
and
have
sacrificed
thereunto,
and
said,
These
be
thy
gods,
O
Israel,
which
have
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
032:009
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
I
have
seen
this
people,
and,
behold,
it
is
a
stiffnecked
people:
032:010
Now
therefore
let
me
alone,
that
my
wrath
may
wax
hot
against
them,
and
that
I
may
consume
them:
and
I
will
make
of
thee
a
great
nation.
032:011
And
Moses
besought
the
LORD
his
God,
and
said,
LORD,
why
doth
thy
wrath
wax
hot
against
thy
people,
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
great
power,
and
with
a
mighty
hand?
032:012
Wherefore
should
the
Egyptians
speak,
and
say,
For
mischief
did
he
bring
them
out,
to
slay
them
in
the
mountains,
and
to
consume
them
from
the
face
of
the
earth?
Turn
from
thy
fierce
wrath,
and
repent
of
this
evil
against
thy
people.
032:013
Remember
Abraham,
Isaac,
and
Israel,
thy
servants,
to
whom
thou
swarest
by
thine
own
self,
and
saidst
unto
them,
I
will
multiply
your
seed
as
the
stars
of
heaven,
and
all
this
land
that
I
have
spoken
of
will
I
give
unto
your
seed,
and
they
shall
inherit
it
for
ever.
032:014
And
the
LORD
repented
of
the
evil
which
he
thought
to
do
unto
his
people.
032:015
And
Moses
turned,
and
went
down
from
the
mount,
and
the
two
tables
of
the
testimony
were
in
his
hand:
the
tables
were
written
on
both
their
sides;
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
were
they
written.
032:016
And
the
tables
were
the
work
of
God,
and
the
writing
was
the
writing
of
God,
graven
upon
the
tables.
032:017
And
when
Joshua
heard
the
noise
of
the
people
as
they
shouted,
he
said
unto
Moses,
There
is
a
noise
of
war
in
the
camp.
032:018
And
he
said,
It
is
not
the
voice
of
them
that
shout
for
mastery,
neither
is
it
the
voice
of
them
that
cry
for
being
overcome:
but
the
noise
of
them
that
sing
do
I
hear.
032:019
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
soon
as
he
came
nigh
unto
the
camp,
that
he
saw
the
calf,
and
the
dancing:
and
Moses'
anger
waxed
hot,
and
he
cast
the
tables
out
of
his
hands,
and
brake
them
beneath
the
mount.
032:020
And
he
took
the
calf
which
they
had
made,
and
burnt
it
in
the
fire,
and
ground
it
to
powder,
and
strawed
it
upon
the
water,
and
made
the
children
of
Israel
drink
of
it.
032:021
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron,
What
did
this
people
unto
thee,
that
thou
hast
brought
so
great
a
sin
upon
them?
032:022
And
Aaron
said,
Let
not
the
anger
of
my
lord
wax
hot:
thou
knowest
the
people,
that
they
are
set
on
mischief.
032:023
For
they
said
unto
me,
Make
us
gods,
which
shall
go
before
us:
for
as
for
this
Moses,
the
man
that
brought
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
him.
032:024
And
I
said
unto
them,
Whosoever
hath
any
gold,
let
them
break
it
off.
So
they
gave
it
me:
then
I
cast
it
into
the
fire,
and
there
came
out
this
calf.
032:025
And
when
Moses
saw
that
the
people
were
naked;
(for
Aaron
had
made
them
naked
unto
their
shame
among
their
enemies:)
032:026
Then
Moses
stood
in
the
gate
of
the
camp,
and
said,
Who
is
on
the
LORD's
side?
let
him
come
unto
me.
And
all
the
sons
of
Levi
gathered
themselves
together
unto
him.
032:027
And
he
said
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Put
every
man
his
sword
by
his
side,
and
go
in
and
out
from
gate
to
gate
throughout
the
camp,
and
slay
every
man
his
brother,
and
every
man
his
companion,
and
every
man
his
neighbour.
032:028
And
the
children
of
Levi
did
according
to
the
word
of
Moses:
and
there
fell
of
the
people
that
day
about
three
thousand
men.
032:029
For
Moses
had
said,
Consecrate
yourselves
today
to
the
LORD,
even
every
man
upon
his
son,
and
upon
his
brother;
that
he
may
bestow
upon
you
a
blessing
this
day.
032:030
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
Moses
said
unto
the
people,
Ye
have
sinned
a
great
sin:
and
now
I
will
go
up
unto
the
LORD;
peradventure
I
shall
make
an
atonement
for
your
sin.
032:031
And
Moses
returned
unto
the
LORD,
and
said,
Oh,
this
people
have
sinned
a
great
sin,
and
have
made
them
gods
of
gold.
032:032
Yet
now,
if
thou
wilt
forgive
their
sin--;
and
if
not,
blot
me,
I
pray
thee,
out
of
thy
book
which
thou
hast
written.
032:033
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Whosoever
hath
sinned
against
me,
him
will
I
blot
out
of
my
book.
032:034
Therefore
now
go,
lead
the
people
unto
the
place
of
which
I
have
spoken
unto
thee:
behold,
mine
Angel
shall
go
before
thee:
nevertheless
in
the
day
when
I
visit
I
will
visit
their
sin
upon
them.
032:035
And
the
LORD
plagued
the
people,
because
they
made
the
calf,
which
Aaron
made.
033:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Depart,
and
go
up
hence,
thou
and
the
people
which
thou
hast
brought
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
unto
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
Abraham,
to
Isaac,
and
to
Jacob,
saying,
Unto
thy
seed
will
I
give
it:
033:002
And
I
will
send
an
angel
before
thee;
and
I
will
drive
out
the
Canaanite,
the
Amorite,
and
the
Hittite,
and
the
Perizzite,
the
Hivite,
and
the
Jebusite:
033:003
Unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey:
for
I
will
not
go
up
in
the
midst
of
thee;
for
thou
art
a
stiffnecked
people:
lest
I
consume
thee
in
the
way.
033:004
And
when
the
people
heard
these
evil
tidings,
they
mourned:
and
no
man
did
put
on
him
his
ornaments.
033:005
For
the
LORD
had
said
unto
Moses,
Say
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
Ye
are
a
stiffnecked
people:
I
will
come
up
into
the
midst
of
thee
in
a
moment,
and
consume
thee:
therefore
now
put
off
thy
ornaments
from
thee,
that
I
may
know
what
to
do
unto
thee.
033:006
And
the
children
of
Israel
stripped
themselves
of
their
ornaments
by
the
mount
Horeb.
033:007
And
Moses
took
the
tabernacle,
and
pitched
it
without
the
camp,
afar
off
from
the
camp,
and
called
it
the
Tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
every
one
which
sought
the
LORD
went
out
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
which
was
without
the
camp.
033:008
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Moses
went
out
unto
the
tabernacle,
that
all
the
people
rose
up,
and
stood
every
man
at
his
tent
door,
and
looked
after
Moses,
until
he
was
gone
into
the
tabernacle.
033:009
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
Moses
entered
into
the
tabernacle,
the
cloudy
pillar
descended,
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle,
and
the
Lord
talked
with
Moses.
033:010
And
all
the
people
saw
the
cloudy
pillar
stand
at
the
tabernacle
door:
and
all
the
people
rose
up
and
worshipped,
every
man
in
his
tent
door.
033:011
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
face
to
face,
as
a
man
speaketh
unto
his
friend.
And
he
turned
again
into
the
camp:
but
his
servant
Joshua,
the
son
of
Nun,
a
young
man,
departed
not
out
of
the
tabernacle.
033:012
And
Moses
said
unto
the
LORD,
See,
thou
sayest
unto
me,
Bring
up
this
people:
and
thou
hast
not
let
me
know
whom
thou
wilt
send
with
me.
Yet
thou
hast
said,
I
know
thee
by
name,
and
thou
hast
also
found
grace
in
my
sight.
033:013
Now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
if
I
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight,
shew
me
now
thy
way,
that
I
may
know
thee,
that
I
may
find
grace
in
thy
sight:
and
consider
that
this
nation
is
thy
people.
033:014
And
he
said,
My
presence
shall
go
with
thee,
and
I
will
give
thee
rest.
033:015
And
he
said
unto
him,
If
thy
presence
go
not
with
me,
carry
us
not
up
hence.
033:016
For
wherein
shall
it
be
known
here
that
I
and
thy
people
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight?
is
it
not
in
that
thou
goest
with
us?
so
shall
we
be
separated,
I
and
thy
people,
from
all
the
people
that
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth.
033:017
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
I
will
do
this
thing
also
that
thou
hast
spoken:
for
thou
hast
found
grace
in
my
sight,
and
I
know
thee
by
name.
033:018
And
he
said,
I
beseech
thee,
shew
me
thy
glory.
033:019
And
he
said,
I
will
make
all
my
goodness
pass
before
thee,
and
I
will
proclaim
the
name
of
the
LORD
before
thee;
and
will
be
gracious
to
whom
I
will
be
gracious,
and
will
shew
mercy
on
whom
I
will
shew
mercy.
033:020
And
he
said,
Thou
canst
not
see
my
face:
for
there
shall
no
man
see
me,
and
live.
033:021
And
the
LORD
said,
Behold,
there
is
a
place
by
me,
and
thou
shalt
stand
upon
a
rock:
033:022
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
while
my
glory
passeth
by,
that
I
will
put
thee
in
a
clift
of
the
rock,
and
will
cover
thee
with
my
hand
while
I
pass
by:
033:023
And
I
will
take
away
mine
hand,
and
thou
shalt
see
my
back
parts:
but
my
face
shall
not
be
seen.
034:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Hew
thee
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first:
and
I
will
write
upon
these
tables
the
words
that
were
in
the
first
tables,
which
thou
brakest.
034:002
And
be
ready
in
the
morning,
and
come
up
in
the
morning
unto
mount
Sinai,
and
present
thyself
there
to
me
in
the
top
of
the
mount.
034:003
And
no
man
shall
come
up
with
thee,
neither
let
any
man
be
seen
throughout
all
the
mount;
neither
let
the
flocks
nor
herds
feed
before
that
mount.
034:004
And
he
hewed
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first;
and
Moses
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
went
up
unto
mount
Sinai,
as
the
LORD
had
commanded
him,
and
took
in
his
hand
the
two
tables
of
stone.
034:005
And
the
LORD
descended
in
the
cloud,
and
stood
with
him
there,
and
proclaimed
the
name
of
the
LORD.
034:006
And
the
LORD
passed
by
before
him,
and
proclaimed,
The
LORD,
The
LORD
God,
merciful
and
gracious,
longsuffering,
and
abundant
in
goodness
and
truth,
034:007
Keeping
mercy
for
thousands,
forgiving
iniquity
and
transgression
and
sin,
and
that
will
by
no
means
clear
the
guilty;
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children,
and
upon
the
children's
children,
unto
the
third
and
to
the
fourth
generation.
034:008
And
Moses
made
haste,
and
bowed
his
head
toward
the
earth,
and
worshipped.
034:009
And
he
said,
If
now
I
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight,
O
LORD,
let
my
LORD,
I
pray
thee,
go
among
us;
for
it
is
a
stiffnecked
people;
and
pardon
our
iniquity
and
our
sin,
and
take
us
for
thine
inheritance.
034:010
And
he
said,
Behold,
I
make
a
covenant:
before
all
thy
people
I
will
do
marvels,
such
as
have
not
been
done
in
all
the
earth,
nor
in
any
nation:
and
all
the
people
among
which
thou
art
shall
see
the
work
of
the
LORD:
for
it
is
a
terrible
thing
that
I
will
do
with
thee.
034:011
Observe
thou
that
which
I
command
thee
this
day:
behold,
I
drive
out
before
thee
the
Amorite,
and
the
Canaanite,
and
the
Hittite,
and
the
Perizzite,
and
the
Hivite,
and
the
Jebusite.
034:012
Take
heed
to
thyself,
lest
thou
make
a
covenant
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
whither
thou
goest,
lest
it
be
for
a
snare
in
the
midst
of
thee:
034:013
But
ye
shall
destroy
their
altars,
break
their
images,
and
cut
down
their
groves:
034:014
For
thou
shalt
worship
no
other
god:
for
the
LORD,
whose
name
is
Jealous,
is
a
jealous
God:
034:015
Lest
thou
make
a
covenant
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land,
and
they
go
a
whoring
after
their
gods,
and
do
sacrifice
unto
their
gods,
and
one
call
thee,
and
thou
eat
of
his
sacrifice;
034:016
And
thou
take
of
their
daughters
unto
thy
sons,
and
their
daughters
go
a
whoring
after
their
gods,
and
make
thy
sons
go
a
whoring
after
their
gods.
034:017
Thou
shalt
make
thee
no
molten
gods.
034:018
The
feast
of
unleavened
bread
shalt
thou
keep.
Seven
days
thou
shalt
eat
unleavened
bread,
as
I
commanded
thee,
in
the
time
of
the
month
Abib:
for
in
the
month
Abib
thou
camest
out
from
Egypt.
034:019
All
that
openeth
the
matrix
is
mine;
and
every
firstling
among
thy
cattle,
whether
ox
or
sheep,
that
is
male.
034:020
But
the
firstling
of
an
ass
thou
shalt
redeem
with
a
lamb:
and
if
thou
redeem
him
not,
then
shalt
thou
break
his
neck.
All
the
firstborn
of
thy
sons
thou
shalt
redeem.
And
none
shall
appear
before
me
empty.
034:021
Six
days
thou
shalt
work,
but
on
the
seventh
day
thou
shalt
rest:
in
earing
time
and
in
harvest
thou
shalt
rest.
034:022
And
thou
shalt
observe
the
feast
of
weeks,
of
the
firstfruits
of
wheat
harvest,
and
the
feast
of
ingathering
at
the
year's
end.
034:023
Thrice
in
the
year
shall
all
your
menchildren
appear
before
the
LORD
God,
the
God
of
Israel.
034:024
For
I
will
cast
out
the
nations
before
thee,
and
enlarge
thy
borders:
neither
shall
any
man
desire
thy
land,
when
thou
shalt
go
up
to
appear
before
the
LORD
thy
God
thrice
in
the
year.
034:025
Thou
shalt
not
offer
the
blood
of
my
sacrifice
with
leaven;
neither
shall
the
sacrifice
of
the
feast
of
the
passover
be
left
unto
the
morning.
034:026
The
first
of
the
firstfruits
of
thy
land
thou
shalt
bring
unto
the
house
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
Thou
shalt
not
seethe
a
kid
in
his
mother's
milk.
034:027
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Write
thou
these
words:
for
after
the
tenor
of
these
words
I
have
made
a
covenant
with
thee
and
with
Israel.
034:028
And
he
was
there
with
the
LORD
forty
days
and
forty
nights;
he
did
neither
eat
bread,
nor
drink
water.
And
he
wrote
upon
the
tables
the
words
of
the
covenant,
the
ten
commandments.
034:029
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Moses
came
down
from
mount
Sinai
with
the
two
tables
of
testimony
in
Moses'
hand,
when
he
came
down
from
the
mount,
that
Moses
wist
not
that
the
skin
of
his
face
shone
while
he
talked
with
him.
034:030
And
when
Aaron
and
all
the
children
of
Israel
saw
Moses,
behold,
the
skin
of
his
face
shone;
and
they
were
afraid
to
come
nigh
him.
034:031
And
Moses
called
unto
them;
and
Aaron
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
congregation
returned
unto
him:
and
Moses
talked
with
them.
034:032
And
afterward
all
the
children
of
Israel
came
nigh:
and
he
gave
them
in
commandment
all
that
the
LORD
had
spoken
with
him
in
mount
Sinai.
034:033
And
till
Moses
had
done
speaking
with
them,
he
put
a
vail
on
his
face.
034:034
But
when
Moses
went
in
before
the
LORD
to
speak
with
him,
he
took
the
vail
off,
until
he
came
out.
And
he
came
out,
and
spake
unto
the
children
of
Israel
that
which
he
was
commanded.
034:035
And
the
children
of
Israel
saw
the
face
of
Moses,
that
the
skin
of
Moses'
face
shone:
and
Moses
put
the
vail
upon
his
face
again,
until
he
went
in
to
speak
with
him.
035:001
And
Moses
gathered
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
together,
and
said
unto
them,
These
are
the
words
which
the
LORD
hath
commanded,
that
ye
should
do
them.
035:002
Six
days
shall
work
be
done,
but
on
the
seventh
day
there
shall
be
to
you
an
holy
day,
a
sabbath
of
rest
to
the
LORD:
whosoever
doeth
work
therein
shall
be
put
to
death.
035:003
Ye
shall
kindle
no
fire
throughout
your
habitations
upon
the
sabbath
day.
035:004
And
Moses
spake
unto
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
commanded,
saying,
035:005
Take
ye
from
among
you
an
offering
unto
the
LORD:
whosoever
is
of
a
willing
heart,
let
him
bring
it,
an
offering
of
the
LORD;
gold,
and
silver,
and
brass,
035:006
And
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
fine
linen,
and
goats'

035:007
And

dyed
red,
and

035:008
And
oil
for
the
light,
and
spices
for
anointing
oil,
and
for
the
sweet
incense,
035:009
And
onyx
stones,
and
stones
to
be
set
for
the
ephod,
and
for
the
breastplate.
035:010
And
every
wise
hearted
among
you
shall
come,
and
make
all
that
the
LORD
hath
commanded;
035:011
The
tabernacle,
his
tent,
and
his
covering,
his
taches,
and
his
boards,
his
bars,
his
pillars,
and
his
sockets,

thereof,

035:013
The
table,
and
his
staves,
and
all
his
vessels,
and
the
shewbread,
035:014
The
candlestick
also
for
the
light,
and
his
furniture,
and
his
lamps,
with
the
oil
for
the
light,
035:015
And
the
incense
altar,
and
his
staves,
and
the
anointing
oil,
and
the
sweet
incense,
and
the
hanging
for
the
door
at
the
entering
in
of
the
tabernacle,
035:016
The
altar
of
burnt
offering,
with
his
brasen
grate,
his
staves,
and
all
his
vessels,
the
laver
and
his
foot,
035:017
The
hangings
of
the
court,

and
their

and
the

for
the
door
of
the
court,
035:018
The

of
the
tabernacle,
and
the

of
the

035:019
The

of
service,
to

service
in
the
holy
place,
the
holy
garments
for
Aaron
the
priest,
and
the
garments
of
his
sons,
to
minister
in
the
priest's
office.
035:020
And
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
departed
from
the
presence
of
Moses.
035:021
And
they
came,
every
one
whose
heart
stirred
him
up,
and
every
one
whom
his
spirit
made
willing,
and
they
brought
the
LORD's
offering
to
the
work
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
for
all
his
service,
and
for
the
holy
garments.
035:022
And
they
came,
both
men
and
women,
as
many
as
were
willing
hearted,
and
brought
bracelets,
and
earrings,
and
rings,
and
tablets,
all
jewels
of
gold:
and
every
man
that
offered
offered
an
offering
of
gold
unto
the
LORD.
035:023
And
every
man,
with
whom
was
found
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
fine
linen,
and
goats'
hair,
and
red
skins
of
rams,
and

brought

035:024
Every
one
that
did
offer
an
offering
of
silver
and
brass
brought
the
LORD's
offering:
and
every
man,
with
whom
was
found
shittim
wood
for
any
work
of
the
service,
brought
it.
035:025
And
all
the
women
that
were
wise
hearted
did
spin
with
their
hands,
and
brought
that
which
they
had
spun,
both
of
blue,
and
of
purple,
and
of
scarlet,
and
of
fine
linen.
035:026
And
all
the
women
whose
heart
stirred
them
up
in
wisdom
spun
goats'
hair.
035:027
And
the
rulers
brought
onyx
stones,
and
stones
to
be
set,
for
the
ephod,
and
for
the
breastplate;
035:028
And
spice,
and
oil
for
the
light,
and
for
the
anointing
oil,
and
for
the
sweet
incense.
035:029
The
children
of
Israel
brought
a
willing
offering
unto
the
LORD,
every
man
and
woman,
whose
heart
made
them
willing
to
bring
for
all
manner
of
work,
which
the
LORD
had
commanded
to
be
made
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
035:030
And
Moses
said
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
See,
the
LORD
hath
called
by
name
Bezaleel
the
son
of
Uri,
the
son
of
Hur,
of
the
tribe
of
Judah;
035:031
And
he
hath
filled
him
with
the
spirit
of
God,
in
wisdom,
in
understanding,
and
in
knowledge,
and
in
all
manner
of
workmanship;
035:032
And
to
devise
curious
works,
to
work
in
gold,
and
in
silver,
and
in
brass,
035:033
And
in
the
cutting
of
stones,
to
set
them,
and
in
carving
of
wood,
to
make
any
manner
of
cunning
work.
035:034
And
he
hath
put
in
his
heart
that
he
may
teach,
both
he,
and
Aholiab,
the
son
of
Ahisamach,
of
the
tribe
of
Dan.
035:035
Them
hath
he
filled
with
wisdom
of
heart,
to
work
all
manner
of
work,
of
the
engraver,
and
of
the
cunning
workman,
and
of
the
embroiderer,
in
blue,
and
in
purple,
in
scarlet,
and
in
fine
linen,
and
of
the
weaver,
even
of
them
that
do
any
work,
and
of
those
that
devise
cunning
work.
036:001
Then
wrought
Bezaleel
and
Aholiab,
and
every
wise
hearted
man,
in
whom
the
LORD
put
wisdom
and
understanding
to
know
how
to
work
all
manner
of
work
for
the
service
of
the
sanctuary,
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
had
commanded.
036:002
And
Moses
called
Bezaleel
and
Aholiab,
and
every
wise
hearted
man,
in
whose
heart
the
LORD
had
put
wisdom,
even
every
one
whose
heart
stirred
him
up
to
come
unto
the
work
to
do
it:
036:003
And
they
received
of
Moses
all
the
offering,
which
the
children
of
Israel
had
brought
for
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
sanctuary,
to
make
it
withal.
And
they
brought
yet
unto
him
free
offerings
every
morning.
036:004
And
all
the
wise
men,
that
wrought
all
the
work
of
the
sanctuary,
came
every
man
from
his
work
which
they
made;
036:005
And
they
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
The
people
bring
much
more
than
enough
for
the
service
of
the
work,
which
the
LORD
commanded
to
make.
036:006
And
Moses
gave
commandment,
and
they
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
throughout
the
camp,
saying,
Let
neither
man
nor
woman
make
any
more
work
for
the
offering
of
the
sanctuary.
So
the
people
were
restrained
from
bringing.
036:007
For
the
stuff
they
had
was
sufficient
for
all
the
work
to
make
it,
and
too
much.
036:008
And
