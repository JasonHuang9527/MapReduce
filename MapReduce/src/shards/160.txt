witnesses?
behold,
now
ye
have
heard
his
blasphemy.
026:066
What
think
ye?
They
answered
and
said,
He
is
guilty
of
death.
026:067
Then
did
they
spit
in
his
face,
and
buffeted
him;
and
others
smote
him
with
the
palms
of
their
hands,
026:068
Saying,
Prophesy
unto
us,
thou
Christ,
Who
is
he
that
smote
thee?
026:069
Now
Peter
sat
without
in
the
palace:
and
a
damsel
came
unto
him,
saying,
Thou
also
wast
with
Jesus
of
Galilee.
026:070
But
he
denied
before
them
all,
saying,
I
know
not
what
thou
sayest.
026:071
And
when
he
was
gone
out
into
the
porch,
another
maid
saw
him,
and
said
unto
them
that
were
there,
This
fellow
was
also
with
Jesus
of
Nazareth.
026:072
And
again
he
denied
with
an
oath,
I
do
not
know
the
man.
026:073
And
after
a
while
came
unto
him
they
that
stood
by,
and
said
to
Peter,
Surely
thou
also
art
one
of
them;
for
thy
speech
bewrayeth
thee.
026:074
Then
began
he
to
curse
and
to
swear,
saying,
I
know
not
the
man.
And
immediately
the
cock
crew.
026:075
And
Peter
remembered
the
word
of
Jesus,
which
said
unto
him,
Before
the
cock
crow,
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice.
And
he
went
out,
and
wept
bitterly.
027:001
When
the
morning
was
come,
all
the
chief
priests
and
elders
of
the
people
took
counsel
against
Jesus
to
put
him
to
death:
027:002
And
when
they
had
bound
him,
they
led
him
away,
and
delivered
him
to
Pontius
Pilate
the
governor.
027:003
Then
Judas,
which
had
betrayed
him,
when
he
saw
that
he
was
condemned,
repented
himself,
and
brought
again
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
to
the
chief
priests
and
elders,
027:004
Saying,
I
have
sinned
in
that
I
have
betrayed
the
innocent
blood.
And
they
said,
What
is
that
to
us?
see
thou
to
that.
027:005
And
he
cast
down
the
pieces
of
silver
in
the
temple,
and
departed,
and
went
and
hanged
himself.
027:006
And
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
pieces,
and
said,
It
is
not
lawful
for
to
put
them
into
the
treasury,
because
it
is
the
price
of
blood.
027:007
And
they
took
counsel,
and
bought
with
them
the
potter's
field,
to
bury
strangers
in.
027:008
Wherefore
that
field
was
called,
The
field
of
blood,
unto
this
day.
027:009
Then
was
fulfilled
that
which
was
spoken
by
Jeremy
the
prophet,
saying,
And
they
took
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver,
the
price
of
him
that
was
valued,
whom
they
of
the
children
of
Israel
did
value;
027:010
And
gave
them
for
the
potter's
field,
as
the
Lord
appointed
me.
027:011
And
Jesus
stood
before
the
governor:
and
the
governor
asked
him,
saying,
Art
thou
the
King
of
the
Jews?
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Thou
sayest.
027:012
And
when
he
was
accused
of
the
chief
priests
and
elders,
he
answered
nothing.
027:013
Then
said
Pilate
unto
him,
Hearest
thou
not
how
many
things
they
witness
against
thee?
027:014
And
he
answered
him
to
never
a
word;
insomuch
that
the
governor
marvelled
greatly.
027:015
Now
at
that
feast
the
governor
was
wont
to
release
unto
the
people
a
prisoner,
whom
they
would.
027:016
And
they
had
then
a
notable
prisoner,
called
Barabbas.
027:017
Therefore
when
they
were
gathered
together,
Pilate
said
unto
them,
Whom
will
ye
that
I
release
unto
you?
Barabbas,
or
Jesus
which
is
called
Christ?
027:018
For
he
knew
that
for
envy
they
had
delivered
him.
027:019
When
he
was
set
down
on
the
judgment
seat,
his
wife
sent
unto
him,
saying,
Have
thou
nothing
to
do
with
that
just
man:
for
I
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
in
a
dream
because
of
him.
027:020
But
the
chief
priests
and
elders
persuaded
the
multitude
that
they
should
ask
Barabbas,
and
destroy
Jesus.
027:021
The
governor
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Whether
of
the
twain
will
ye
that
I
release
unto
you?
They
said,
Barabbas.
027:022
Pilate
saith
unto
them,
What
shall
I
do
then
with
Jesus
which
is
called
Christ?
They
all
say
unto
him,
Let
him
be
crucified.
027:023
And
the
governor
said,
Why,
what
evil
hath
he
done?
But
they
cried
out
the
more,
saying,
Let
him
be
crucified.
027:024
When
Pilate
saw
that
he
could
prevail
nothing,
but
that
rather
a
tumult
was
made,
he
took
water,
and
washed
his
hands
before
the
multitude,
saying,
I
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person:
see
ye
to
it.
027:025
Then
answered
all
the
people,
and
said,
His
blood
be
on
us,
and
on
our
children.
027:026
Then
released
he
Barabbas
unto
them:
and
when
he
had
scourged
Jesus,
he
delivered
him
to
be
crucified.
027:027
Then
the
soldiers
of
the
governor
took
Jesus
into
the
common
hall,
and
gathered
unto
him
the
whole
band
of
soldiers.
027:028
And
they
stripped
him,
and
put
on
him
a
scarlet
robe.
027:029
And
when
they
had
platted
a
crown
of
thorns,
they
put
it
upon
his
head,
and
a
reed
in
his
right
hand:
and
they
bowed
the
knee
before
him,
and
mocked
him,
saying,
Hail,
King
of
the
Jews!
027:030
And
they
spit
upon
him,
and
took
the
reed,
and
smote
him
on
the
head.
027:031
And
after
that
they
had
mocked
him,
they
took
the
robe
off
from
him,
and
put
his
own
raiment
on
him,
and
led
him
away
to
crucify
him.
027:032
And
as
they
came
out,
they
found
a
man
of
Cyrene,
Simon
by
name:
him
they
compelled
to
bear
his
cross.
027:033
And
when
they
were
come
unto
a
place
called
Golgotha,
that
is
to
say,
a
place
of
a
skull,
027:034
They
gave
him
vinegar
to
drink
mingled
with
gall:
and
when
he
had
tasted
thereof,
he
would
not
drink.
027:035
And
they
crucified
him,
and
parted
his
garments,
casting
lots:
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet,
They
parted
my
garments
among
them,
and
upon
my
vesture
did
they
cast
lots.
027:036
And
sitting
down
they
watched
him
there;
027:037
And
set
up
over
his
head
his
accusation
written,
THIS
IS
JESUS
THE
KING
OF
THE
JEWS.
027:038
Then
were
there
two
thieves
crucified
with
him,
one
on
the
right
hand,
and
another
on
the
left.
027:039
And
they
that
passed
by
reviled
him,
wagging
their
heads,
027:040
And
saying,
Thou
that
destroyest
the
temple,
and
buildest
it
in
three
days,
save
thyself.
If
thou
be
the
Son
of
God,
come
down
from
the
cross.
027:041
Likewise
also
the
chief
priests
mocking
him,
with
the
scribes
and
elders,
said,
027:042
He
saved
others;
himself
he
cannot
save.
If
he
be
the
King
of
Israel,
let
him
now
come
down
from
the
cross,
and
we
will
believe
him.
027:043
He
trusted
in
God;
let
him
deliver
him
now,
if
he
will
have
him:
for
he
said,
I
am
the
Son
of
God.
027:044
The
thieves
also,
which
were
crucified
with
him,
cast
the
same
in
his
teeth.
027:045
Now
from
the
sixth
hour
there
was
darkness
over
all
the
land
unto
the
ninth
hour.
027:046
And
about
the
ninth
hour
Jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
saying,
Eli,
Eli,
lama
sabachthani?
that
is
to
say,
My
God,
my
God,
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me?
027:047
Some
of
them
that
stood
there,
when
they
heard
that,
said,
This
man
calleth
for
Elias.
027:048
And
straightway
one
of
them
ran,
and
took
a
spunge,
and
filled
it
with
vinegar,
and
put
it
on
a
reed,
and
gave
him
to
drink.
027:049
The
rest
said,
Let
be,
let
us
see
whether
Elias
will
come
to
save
him.
027:050
Jesus,
when
he
had
cried
again
with
a
loud
voice,
yielded
up
the
ghost.
027:051
And,
behold,
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
from
the
top
to
the
bottom;
and
the
earth
did
quake,
and
the
rocks
rent;
027:052
And
the
graves
were
opened;
and
many
bodies
of
the
saints
which
slept
arose,
027:053
And
came
out
of
the
graves
after
his
resurrection,
and
went
into
the
holy
city,
and
appeared
unto
many.
027:054
Now
when
the
centurion,
and
they
that
were
with
him,
watching
Jesus,
saw
the
earthquake,
and
those
things
that
were
done,
they
feared
greatly,
saying,
Truly
this
was
the
Son
of
God.
027:055
And
many
women
were
there
beholding
afar
off,
which
followed
Jesus
from
Galilee,
ministering
unto
him:
027:056
Among
which
was
Mary
Magdalene,
and
Mary
the
mother
of
James
and
Joses,
and
the
mother
of
Zebedees
children.
027:057
When
the
even
was
come,
there
came
a
rich
man
of
Arimathaea,
named
Joseph,
who
also
himself
was
Jesus'
disciple:
027:058
He
went
to
Pilate,
and
begged
the
body
of
Jesus.
Then
Pilate
commanded
the
body
to
be
delivered.
027:059
And
when
Joseph
had
taken
the
body,
he
wrapped
it
in
a
clean
linen
cloth,
027:060
And
laid
it
in
his
own
new
tomb,
which
he
had
hewn
out
in
the
rock:
and
he
rolled
a
great
stone
to
the
door
of
the
sepulchre,
and
departed.
027:061
And
there
was
Mary
Magdalene,
and
the
other
Mary,
sitting
over
against
the
sepulchre.
027:062
Now
the
next
day,
that
followed
the
day
of
the
preparation,
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees
came
together
unto
Pilate,
027:063
Saying,
Sir,
we
remember
that
that
deceiver
said,
while
he
was
yet
alive,
After
three
days
I
will
rise
again.
027:064
Command
therefore
that
the
sepulchre
be
made
sure
until
the
third
day,
lest
his
disciples
come
by
night,
and
steal
him
away,
and
say
unto
the
people,
He
is
risen
from
the
dead:
so
the
last
error
shall
be
worse
than
the
first.
027:065
Pilate
said
unto
them,
Ye
have
a
watch:
go
your
way,
make
it
as
sure
as
ye
can.
027:066
So
they
went,
and
made
the
sepulchre
sure,
sealing
the
stone,
and
setting
a
watch.
028:001
In
the
end
of
the
sabbath,
as
it
began
to
dawn
toward
the
first
day
of
the
week,
came
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
to
see
the
sepulchre.
028:002
And,
behold,
there
was
a
great
earthquake:
for
the
angel
of
the
Lord
descended
from
heaven,
and
came
and
rolled
back
the
stone
from
the
door,
and
sat
upon
it.
028:003
His
countenance
was
like
lightning,
and
his
raiment
white
as
snow:
028:004
And
for
fear
of
him
the
keepers
did
shake,
and
became
as
dead
men.
028:005
And
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
the
women,
Fear
not
ye:
for
I
know
that
ye
seek
Jesus,
which
was
crucified.
028:006
He
is
not
here:
for
he
is
risen,
as
he
said.
Come,
see
the
place
where
the
Lord
lay.
028:007
And
go
quickly,
and
tell
his
disciples
that
he
is
risen
from
the
dead;
and,
behold,
he
goeth
before
you
into
Galilee;
there
shall
ye
see
him:
lo,
I
have
told
you.
028:008
And
they
departed
quickly
from
the
sepulchre
with
fear
and
great
joy;
and
did
run
to
bring
his
disciples
word.
028:009
And
as
they
went
to
tell
his
disciples,
behold,
Jesus
met
them,
saying,
All
hail.
And
they
came
and
held
him
by
the
feet,
and
worshipped
him.
028:010
Then
said
Jesus
unto
them,
Be
not
afraid:
go
tell
my
brethren
that
they
go
into
Galilee,
and
there
shall
they
see
me.
028:011
Now
when
they
were
going,
behold,
some
of
the
watch
came
into
the
city,
and
shewed
unto
the
chief
priests
all
the
things
that
were
done.
028:012
And
when
they
were
assembled
with
the
elders,
and
had
taken
counsel,
they
gave
large
money
unto
the
soldiers,
028:013
Saying,
Say
ye,
His
disciples
came
by
night,
and
stole
him
away
while
we
slept.
028:014
And
if
this
come
to
the
governor's
ears,
we
will
persuade
him,
and
secure
you.
028:015
So
they
took
the
money,
and
did
as
they
were
taught:
and
this
saying
is
commonly
reported
among
the
Jews
until
this
day.
028:016
Then
the
eleven
disciples
went
away
into
Galilee,
into
a
mountain
where
Jesus
had
appointed
them.
028:017
And
when
they
saw
him,
they
worshipped
him:
but
some
doubted.
028:018
And
Jesus
came
and
spake
unto
them,
saying,
All
power
is
given
unto
me
in
heaven
and
in
earth.
028:019
Go
ye
therefore,
and
teach
all
nations,
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
Father,
and
of
the
Son,
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost:
028:020
Teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
I
have
commanded
you:
and,
lo,
I
am
with
you
alway,
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world.
Amen.
Book
41	Mark
001:001
The
beginning
of
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ,
the
Son
of
God;
001:002
As
it
is
written
in
the
prophets,
Behold,
I
send
my
messenger
before
thy
face,
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee.
001:003
The
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness,
Prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
Lord,
make
his
paths
straight.
001:004
John
did
baptize
in
the
wilderness,
and
preach
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins.
001:005
And
there
went
out
unto
him
all
the
land
of
Judaea,
and
they
of
Jerusalem,
and
were
all
baptized
of
him
in
the
river
of
Jordan,
confessing
their
sins.
001:006
And
John
was
clothed
with
camel's
hair,
and
with
a
girdle
of
a
skin
about
his
loins;
and
he
did
eat
locusts
and
wild
honey;
001:007
And
preached,
saying,
There
cometh
one
mightier
than
I
after
me,
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
I
am
not
worthy
to
stoop
down
and
unloose.
001:008
I
indeed
have
baptized
you
with
water:
but
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
Holy
Ghost.
001:009
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days,
that
Jesus
came
from
Nazareth
of
Galilee,
and
was
baptized
of
John
in
Jordan.
001:010
And
straightway
coming
up
out
of
the
water,
he
saw
the
heavens
opened,
and
the
Spirit
like
a
dove
descending
upon
him:
001:011
And
there
came
a
voice
from
heaven,
saying,
Thou
art
my
beloved
Son,
in
whom
I
am
well
pleased.
001:012
And
immediately
the
spirit
driveth
him
into
the
wilderness.
001:013
And
he
was
there
in
the
wilderness
forty
days,
tempted
of
Satan;
and
was
with
the
wild
beasts;
and
the
angels
ministered
unto
him.
001:014
Now
after
that
John
was
put
in
prison,
Jesus
came
into
Galilee,
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom
of
God,
001:015
And
saying,
The
time
is
fulfilled,
and
the
kingdom
of
God
is
at
hand:
repent
ye,
and
believe
the
gospel.
001:016
Now
as
he
walked
by
the
sea
of
Galilee,
he
saw
Simon
and
Andrew
his
brother
casting
a
net
into
the
sea:
for
they
were
fishers.
001:017
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Come
ye
after
me,
and
I
will
make
you
to
become
fishers
of
men.
001:018
And
straightway
they
forsook
their
nets,
and
followed
him.
001:019
And
when
he
had
gone
a
little
farther
thence,
he
saw
James
the
son
of
Zebedee,
and
John
his
brother,
who
also
were
in
the
ship
mending
their
nets.
001:020
And
straightway
he
called
them:
and
they
left
their
father
Zebedee
in
the
ship
with
the
hired
servants,
and
went
after
him.
001:021
And
they
went
into
Capernaum;
and
straightway
on
the
sabbath
day
he
entered
into
the
synagogue,
and
taught.
001:022
And
they
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine:
for
he
taught
them
as
one
that
had
authority,
and
not
as
the
scribes.
001:023
And
there
was
in
their
synagogue
a
man
with
an
unclean
spirit;
and
he
cried
out,
001:024
Saying,
Let
us
alone;
what
have
we
to
do
with
thee,
thou
Jesus
of
Nazareth?
art
thou
come
to
destroy
us?
I
know
thee
who
thou
art,
the
Holy
One
of
God.
001:025
And
Jesus
rebuked
him,
saying,
Hold
thy
peace,
and
come
out
of
him.
001:026
And
when
the
unclean
spirit
had
torn
him,
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
he
came
out
of
him.
001:027
And
they
were
all
amazed,
insomuch
that
they
questioned
among
themselves,
saying,
What
thing
is
this?
what
new
doctrine
is
this?
for
with
authority
commandeth
he
even
the
unclean
spirits,
and
they
do
obey
him.
001:028
And
immediately
his
fame
spread
abroad
throughout
all
the
region
round
about
Galilee.
001:029
And
forthwith,
when
they
were
come
out
of
the
synagogue,
they
entered
into
the
house
of
Simon
and
Andrew,
with
James
and
John.
001:030
But
Simon's
wife's
mother
lay
sick
of
a
fever,
and
anon
they
tell
him
of
her.
001:031
And
he
came
and
took
her
by
the
hand,
and
lifted
her
up;
and
immediately
the
fever
left
her,
and
she
ministered
unto
them.
001:032
And
at
even,
when
the
sun
did
set,
they
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
diseased,
and
them
that
were
possessed
with
devils.
001:033
And
all
the
city
was
gathered
together
at
the
door.
001:034
And
he
healed
many
that
were
sick
of
divers
diseases,
and
cast
out
many
devils;
and
suffered
not
the
devils
to
speak,
because
they
knew
him.
001:035
And
in
the
morning,
rising
up
a
great
while
before
day,
he
went
out,
and
departed
into
a
solitary
place,
and
there
prayed.
001:036
And
Simon
and
they
that
were
with
him
followed
after
him.
001:037
And
when
they
had
found
him,
they
said
unto
him,
All
men
seek
for
thee.
001:038
And
he
said
unto
them,
Let
us
go
into
the
next
towns,
that
I
may
preach
there
also:
for
therefore
came
I
forth.
001:039
And
he
preached
in
their
synagogues
throughout
all
Galilee,
and
cast
out
devils.
001:040
And
there
came
a
leper
to
him,
beseeching
him,
and
kneeling
down
to
him,
and
saying
unto
him,
If
thou
wilt,
thou
canst
make
me
clean.
001:041
And
Jesus,
moved
with
compassion,
put
forth
his
hand,
and
touched
him,
and
saith
unto
him,
I
will;
be
thou
clean.
001:042
And
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken,
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
him,
and
he
was
cleansed.
001:043
And
he
straitly
charged
him,
and
forthwith
sent
him
away;
001:044
And
saith
unto
him,
See
thou
say
nothing
to
any
man:
but
go
thy
way,
shew
thyself
to
the
priest,
and
offer
for
thy
cleansing
those
things
which
Moses
commanded,
for
a
testimony
unto
them.
001:045
But
he
went
out,
and
began
to
publish
it
much,
and
to
blaze
abroad
the
matter,
insomuch
that
Jesus
could
no
more
openly
enter
into
the
city,
but
was
without
in
desert
places:
and
they
came
to
him
from
every
quarter.
002:001
And
again
he
entered
into
Capernaum
after
some
days;
and
it
was
noised
that
he
was
in
the
house.
002:002
And
straightway
many
were
gathered
together,
insomuch
that
there
was
no
room
to
receive
them,
no,
not
so
much
as
about
the
door:
and
he
preached
the
word
unto
them.
002:003
And
they
come
unto
him,
bringing
one
sick
of
the
palsy,
which
was
borne
of
four.
002:004
And
when
they
could
not
come
nigh
unto
him
for
the
press,
they
uncovered
the
roof
where
he
was:
and
when
they
had
broken
it
up,
they
let
down
the
bed
wherein
the
sick
of
the
palsy
lay.
002:005
When
Jesus
saw
their
faith,
he
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
palsy,
Son,
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee.
002:006
But
there
was
certain
of
the
scribes
sitting
there,
and
reasoning
in
their
hearts,
002:007
Why
doth
this
man
thus
speak
blasphemies?
who
can
forgive
sins
but
God
only?
002:008
And
immediately
when
Jesus
perceived
in
his
spirit
that
they
so
reasoned
within
themselves,
he
said
unto
them,
Why
reason
ye
these
things
in
your
hearts?
002:009
Whether
is
it
easier
to
say
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy,
Thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee;
or
to
say,
Arise,
and
take
up
thy
bed,
and
walk?
002:010
But
that
ye
may
know
that
the
Son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
sins,
(he
saith
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy,)
002:011
I
say
unto
thee,
Arise,
and
take
up
thy
bed,
and
go
thy
way
into
thine
house.
002:012
And
immediately
he
arose,
took
up
the
bed,
and
went
forth
before
them
all;
insomuch
that
they
were
all
amazed,
and
glorified
God,
saying,
We
never
saw
it
on
this
fashion.
002:013
And
he
went
forth
again
by
the
sea
side;
and
all
the
multitude
resorted
unto
him,
and
he
taught
them.
002:014
And
as
he
passed
by,
he
saw
Levi
the
son
of
Alphaeus
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
custom,
and
said
unto
him,
Follow
me.
And
he
arose
and
followed
him.
002:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
as
Jesus
sat
at
meat
in
his
house,
many
publicans
and
sinners
sat
also
together
with
Jesus
and
his
disciples:
for
there
were
many,
and
they
followed
him.
002:016
And
when
the
scribes
and
Pharisees
saw
him
eat
with
publicans
and
sinners,
they
said
unto
his
disciples,
How
is
it
that
he
eateth
and
drinketh
with
publicans
and
sinners?
002:017
When
Jesus
heard
it,
he
saith
unto
them,
They
that
are
whole
have
no
need
of
the
physician,
but
they
that
are
sick:
I
came
not
to
call
the
righteous,
but
sinners
to
repentance.
002:018
And
the
disciples
of
John
and
of
the
Pharisees
used
to
fast:
and
they
come
and
say
unto
him,
Why
do
the
disciples
of
John
and
of
the
Pharisees
fast,
but
thy
disciples
fast
not?
002:019
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Can
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
fast,
while
the
bridegroom
is
with
them?
as
long
as
they
have
the
bridegroom
with
them,
they
cannot
fast.
002:020
But
the
days
will
come,
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
away
from
them,
and
then
shall
they
fast
in
those
days.
002:021
No
man
also
seweth
a
piece
of
new
cloth
on
an
old
garment:
else
the
new
piece
that
filled
it
up
taketh
away
from
the
old,
and
the
rent
is
made
worse.
002:022
And
no
man
putteth
new
wine
into
old
bottles:
else
the
new
wine
doth
burst
the
bottles,
and
the
wine
is
spilled,
and
the
bottles
will
be
marred:
but
new
wine
must
be
put
into
new
bottles.
002:023
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
he
went
through
the
corn
fields
on
the
sabbath
day;
and
his
disciples
began,
as
they
went,
to
pluck
the
ears
of
corn.
002:024
And
the
Pharisees
said
unto
him,
Behold,
why
do
they
on
the
sabbath
day
that
which
is
not
lawful?
002:025
And
he
said
unto
them,
Have
ye
never
read
what
David
did,
when
he
had
need,
and
was
an
hungred,
he,
and
they
that
were
with
him?
002:026
How
he
went
into
the
house
of
God
in
the
days
of
Abiathar
the
high
priest,
and
did
eat
the
shewbread,
which
is
not
lawful
to
eat
but
for
the
priests,
and
gave
also
to
them
which
were
with
him?
002:027
And
he
said
unto
them,
The
sabbath
was
made
for
man,
and
not
man
for
the
sabbath:
002:028
Therefore
the
Son
of
man
is
Lord
also
of
the
sabbath.
003:001
And
he
entered
again
into
the
synagogue;
and
there
was
a
man
there
which
had
a
withered
hand.
003:002
And
they
watched
him,
whether
he
would
heal
him
on
the
sabbath
day;
that
they
might
accuse
him.
003:003
And
he
saith
unto
the
man
which
had
the
withered
hand,
Stand
forth.
003:004
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Is
it
lawful
to
do
good
on
the
sabbath
days,
or
to
do
evil?
to
save
life,
or
to
kill?
But
they
held
their
peace.
003:005
And
when
he
had
looked
round
about
on
them
with
anger,
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts,
he
saith
unto
the
man,
Stretch
forth
thine
hand.
And
he
stretched
it
out:
and
his
hand
was
restored
whole
as
the
other.
003:006
And
the
Pharisees
went
forth,
and
straightway
took
counsel
with
the
Herodians
against
him,
how
they
might
destroy
him.
003:007
But
Jesus
withdrew
himself
with
his
disciples
to
the
sea:
and
a
great
multitude
from
Galilee
followed
him,
and
from
Judaea,
003:008
And
from
Jerusalem,
and
from
Idumaea,
and
from
beyond
Jordan;
and
they
about
Tyre
and
Sidon,
a
great
multitude,
when
they
had
heard
what
great
things
he
did,
came
unto
him.
003:009
And
he
spake
to
his
disciples,
that
a
small
ship
should
wait
on
him
because
of
the
multitude,
lest
they
should
throng
him.
003:010
For
he
had
healed
many;
insomuch
that
they
pressed
upon
him
for
to
touch
him,
as
many
as
had
plagues.
003:011
And
unclean
spirits,
when
they
saw
him,
fell
down
before
him,
and
cried,
saying,
Thou
art
the
Son
of
God.
003:012
And
he
straitly
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
known.
003:013
And
he
goeth
up
into
a
mountain,
and
calleth
unto
him
