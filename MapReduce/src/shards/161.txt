whom
he
would:
and
they
came
unto
him.
003:014
And
he
ordained
twelve,
that
they
should
be
with
him,
and
that
he
might
send
them
forth
to
preach,
003:015
And
to
have
power
to
heal
sicknesses,
and
to
cast
out
devils:
003:016
And
Simon
he
surnamed
Peter;
003:017
And
James
the
son
of
Zebedee,
and
John
the
brother
of
James;
and
he
surnamed
them
Boanerges,
which
is,
The
sons
of
thunder:
003:018
And
Andrew,
and
Philip,
and
Bartholomew,
and
Matthew,
and
Thomas,
and
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus,
and
Thaddaeus,
and
Simon
the
Canaanite,
003:019
And
Judas
Iscariot,
which
also
betrayed
him:
and
they
went
into
an
house.
003:020
And
the
multitude
cometh
together
again,
so
that
they
could
not
so
much
as
eat
bread.
003:021
And
when
his
friends
heard
of
it,
they
went
out
to
lay
hold
on
him:
for
they
said,
He
is
beside
himself.
003:022
And
the
scribes
which
came
down
from
Jerusalem
said,
He
hath
Beelzebub,
and
by
the
prince
of
the
devils
casteth
he
out
devils.
003:023
And
he
called
them
unto
him,
and
said
unto
them
in
parables,
How
can
Satan
cast
out
Satan?
003:024
And
if
a
kingdom
be
divided
against
itself,
that
kingdom
cannot
stand.
003:025
And
if
a
house
be
divided
against
itself,
that
house
cannot
stand.
003:026
And
if
Satan
rise
up
against
himself,
and
be
divided,
he
cannot
stand,
but
hath
an
end.
003:027
No
man
can
enter
into
a
strong
man's
house,
and
spoil
his
goods,
except
he
will
first
bind
the
strong
man;
and
then
he
will
spoil
his
house.
003:028
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
All
sins
shall
be
forgiven
unto
the
sons
of
men,
and
blasphemies
wherewith
soever
they
shall
blaspheme:
003:029
But
he
that
shall
blaspheme
against
the
Holy
Ghost
hath
never
forgiveness,
but
is
in
danger
of
eternal
damnation.
003:030
Because
they
said,
He
hath
an
unclean
spirit.
003:031
There
came
then
his
brethren
and
his
mother,
and,
standing
without,
sent
unto
him,
calling
him.
003:032
And
the
multitude
sat
about
him,
and
they
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
without
seek
for
thee.
003:033
And
he
answered
them,
saying,
Who
is
my
mother,
or
my
brethren?
003:034
And
he
looked
round
about
on
them
which
sat
about
him,
and
said,
Behold
my
mother
and
my
brethren!
003:035
For
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
God,
the
same
is
my
brother,
and
my
sister,
and
mother.
004:001
And
he
began
again
to
teach
by
the
sea
side:
and
there
was
gathered
unto
him
a
great
multitude,
so
that
he
entered
into
a
ship,
and
sat
in
the
sea;
and
the
whole
multitude
was
by
the
sea
on
the
land.
004:002
And
he
taught
them
many
things
by
parables,
and
said
unto
them
in
his
doctrine,
004:003
Hearken;
Behold,
there
went
out
a
sower
to
sow:
004:004
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
sowed,
some
fell
by
the
way
side,
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
came
and
devoured
it
up.
004:005
And
some
fell
on
stony
ground,
where
it
had
not
much
earth;
and
immediately
it
sprang
up,
because
it
had
no
depth
of
earth:
004:006
But
when
the
sun
was
up,
it
was
scorched;
and
because
it
had
no
root,
it
withered
away.
004:007
And
some
fell
among
thorns,
and
the
thorns
grew
up,
and
choked
it,
and
it
yielded
no
fruit.
004:008
And
other
fell
on
good
ground,
and
did
yield
fruit
that
sprang
up
and
increased;
and
brought
forth,
some
thirty,
and
some
sixty,
and
some
an
hundred.
004:009
And
he
said
unto
them,
He
that
hath
ears
to
hear,
let
him
hear.
004:010
And
when
he
was
alone,
they
that
were
about
him
with
the
twelve
asked
of
him
the
parable.
004:011
And
he
said
unto
them,
Unto
you
it
is
given
to
know
the
mystery
of
the
kingdom
of
God:
but
unto
them
that
are
without,
all
these
things
are
done
in
parables:
004:012
That
seeing
they
may
see,
and
not
perceive;
and
hearing
they
may
hear,
and
not
understand;
lest
at
any
time
they
should
be
converted,
and
their
sins
should
be
forgiven
them.
004:013
And
he
said
unto
them,
Know
ye
not
this
parable?
and
how
then
will
ye
know
all
parables?
004:014
The
sower
soweth
the
word.
004:015
And
these
are
they
by
the
way
side,
where
the
word
is
sown;
but
when
they
have
heard,
Satan
cometh
immediately,
and
taketh
away
the
word
that
was
sown
in
their
hearts.
004:016
And
these
are
they
likewise
which
are
sown
on
stony
ground;
who,
when
they
have
heard
the
word,
immediately
receive
it
with
gladness;
004:017
And
have
no
root
in
themselves,
and
so
endure
but
for
a
time:
afterward,
when
affliction
or
persecution
ariseth
for
the
word's
sake,
immediately
they
are
offended.
004:018
And
these
are
they
which
are
sown
among
thorns;
such
as
hear
the
word,
004:019
And
the
cares
of
this
world,
and
the
deceitfulness
of
riches,
and
the
lusts
of
other
things
entering
in,
choke
the
word,
and
it
becometh
unfruitful.
004:020
And
these
are
they
which
are
sown
on
good
ground;
such
as
hear
the
word,
and
receive
it,
and
bring
forth
fruit,
some
thirtyfold,
some
sixty,
and
some
an
hundred.
004:021
And
he
said
unto
them,
Is
a
candle
brought
to
be
put
under
a
bushel,
or
under
a
bed?
and
not
to
be
set
on
a
candlestick?
004:022
For
there
is
nothing
hid,
which
shall
not
be
manifested;
neither
was
any
thing
kept
secret,
but
that
it
should
come
abroad.
004:023
If
any
man
have
ears
to
hear,
let
him
hear.
004:024
And
he
said
unto
them,
Take
heed
what
ye
hear:
with
what
measure
ye
mete,
it
shall
be
measured
to
you:
and
unto
you
that
hear
shall
more
be
given.
004:025
For
he
that
hath,
to
him
shall
be
given:
and
he
that
hath
not,
from
him
shall
be
taken
even
that
which
he
hath.
004:026
And
he
said,
So
is
the
kingdom
of
God,
as
if
a
man
should
cast
seed
into
the
ground;
004:027
And
should
sleep,
and
rise
night
and
day,
and
the
seed
should
spring
and
grow
up,
he
knoweth
not
how.
004:028
For
the
earth
bringeth
forth
fruit
of
herself;
first
the
blade,
then
the
ear,
after
that
the
full
corn
in
the
ear.
004:029
But
when
the
fruit
is
brought
forth,
immediately
he
putteth
in
the
sickle,
because
the
harvest
is
come.
004:030
And
he
said,
Whereunto
shall
we
liken
the
kingdom
of
God?
or
with
what
comparison
shall
we
compare
it?
004:031
It
is
like
a
grain
of
mustard
seed,
which,
when
it
is
sown
in
the
earth,
is
less
than
all
the
seeds
that
be
in
the
earth:
004:032
But
when
it
is
sown,
it
groweth
up,
and
becometh
greater
than
all
herbs,
and
shooteth
out
great
branches;
so
that
the
fowls
of
the
air
may
lodge
under
the
shadow
of
it.
004:033
And
with
many
such
parables
spake
he
the
word
unto
them,
as
they
were
able
to
hear
it.
004:034
But
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
them:
and
when
they
were
alone,
he
expounded
all
things
to
his
disciples.
004:035
And
the
same
day,
when
the
even
was
come,
he
saith
unto
them,
Let
us
pass
over
unto
the
other
side.
004:036
And
when
they
had
sent
away
the
multitude,
they
took
him
even
as
he
was
in
the
ship.
And
there
were
also
with
him
other
little
ships.
004:037
And
there
arose
a
great
storm
of
wind,
and
the
waves
beat
into
the
ship,
so
that
it
was
now
full.
004:038
And
he
was
in
the
hinder
part
of
the
ship,
asleep
on
a
pillow:
and
they
awake
him,
and
say
unto
him,
Master,
carest
thou
not
that
we
perish?
004:039
And
he
arose,
and
rebuked
the
wind,
and
said
unto
the
sea,
Peace,
be
still.
And
the
wind
ceased,
and
there
was
a
great
calm.
004:040
And
he
said
unto
them,
Why
are
ye
so
fearful?
how
is
it
that
ye
have
no
faith?
004:041
And
they
feared
exceedingly,
and
said
one
to
another,
What
manner
of
man
is
this,
that
even
the
wind
and
the
sea
obey
him?
005:001
And
they
came
over
unto
the
other
side
of
the
sea,
into
the
country
of
the
Gadarenes.
005:002
And
when
he
was
come
out
of
the
ship,
immediately
there
met
him
out
of
the
tombs
a
man
with
an
unclean
spirit,
005:003
Who
had
his
dwelling
among
the
tombs;
and
no
man
could
bind
him,
no,
not
with
chains:
005:004
Because
that
he
had
been
often
bound
with
fetters
and
chains,
and
the
chains
had
been
plucked
asunder
by
him,
and
the
fetters
broken
in
pieces:
neither
could
any
man
tame
him.
005:005
And
always,
night
and
day,
he
was
in
the
mountains,
and
in
the
tombs,
crying,
and
cutting
himself
with
stones.
005:006
But
when
he
saw
Jesus
afar
off,
he
ran
and
worshipped
him,
005:007
And
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
and
said,
What
have
I
to
do
with
thee,
Jesus,
thou
Son
of
the
most
high
God?
I
adjure
thee
by
God,
that
thou
torment
me
not.
005:008
For
he
said
unto
him,
Come
out
of
the
man,
thou
unclean
spirit.
005:009
And
he
asked
him,
What
is
thy
name?
And
he
answered,
saying,
My
name
is
Legion:
for
we
are
many.
005:010
And
he
besought
him
much
that
he
would
not
send
them
away
out
of
the
country.
005:011
Now
there
was
there
nigh
unto
the
mountains
a
great
herd
of
swine
feeding.
005:012
And
all
the
devils
besought
him,
saying,
Send
us
into
the
swine,
that
we
may
enter
into
them.
005:013
And
forthwith
Jesus
gave
them
leave.
And
the
unclean
spirits
went
out,
and
entered
into
the
swine:
and
the
herd
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea,
(they
were
about
two
thousand;)
and
were
choked
in
the
sea.
005:014
And
they
that
fed
the
swine
fled,
and
told
it
in
the
city,
and
in
the
country.
And
they
went
out
to
see
what
it
was
that
was
done.
005:015
And
they
come
to
Jesus,
and
see
him
that
was
possessed
with
the
devil,
and
had
the
legion,
sitting,
and
clothed,
and
in
his
right
mind:
and
they
were
afraid.
005:016
And
they
that
saw
it
told
them
how
it
befell
to
him
that
was
possessed
with
the
devil,
and
also
concerning
the
swine.
005:017
And
they
began
to
pray
him
to
depart
out
of
their
coasts.
005:018
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
ship,
he
that
had
been
possessed
with
the
devil
prayed
him
that
he
might
be
with
him.
005:019
Howbeit
Jesus
suffered
him
not,
but
saith
unto
him,
Go
home
to
thy
friends,
and
tell
them
how
great
things
the
Lord
hath
done
for
thee,
and
hath
had
compassion
on
thee.
005:020
And
he
departed,
and
began
to
publish
in
Decapolis
how
great
things
Jesus
had
done
for
him:
and
all
men
did
marvel.
005:021
And
when
Jesus
was
passed
over
again
by
ship
unto
the
other
side,
much
people
gathered
unto
him:
and
he
was
nigh
unto
the
sea.
005:022
And,
behold,
there
cometh
one
of
the
rulers
of
the
synagogue,
Jairus
by
name;
and
when
he
saw
him,
he
fell
at
his
feet,
005:023
And
besought
him
greatly,
saying,
My
little
daughter
lieth
at
the
point
of
death:
I
pray
thee,
come
and
lay
thy
hands
on
her,
that
she
may
be
healed;
and
she
shall
live.
005:024
And
Jesus
went
with
him;
and
much
people
followed
him,
and
thronged
him.
005:025
And
a
certain
woman,
which
had
an
issue
of
blood
twelve
years,
005:026
And
had
suffered
many
things
of
many
physicians,
and
had
spent
all
that
she
had,
and
was
nothing
bettered,
but
rather
grew
worse,
005:027
When
she
had
heard
of
Jesus,
came
in
the
press
behind,
and
touched
his
garment.
005:028
For
she
said,
If
I
may
touch
but
his
clothes,
I
shall
be
whole.
005:029
And
straightway
the
fountain
of
her
blood
was
dried
up;
and
she
felt
in
her
body
that
she
was
healed
of
that
plague.
005:030
And
Jesus,
immediately
knowing
in
himself
that
virtue
had
gone
out
of
him,
turned
him
about
in
the
press,
and
said,
Who
touched
my
clothes?
005:031
And
his
disciples
said
unto
him,
Thou
seest
the
multitude
thronging
thee,
and
sayest
thou,
Who
touched
me?
005:032
And
he
looked
round
about
to
see
her
that
had
done
this
thing.
005:033
But
the
woman
fearing
and
trembling,
knowing
what
was
done
in
her,
came
and
fell
down
before
him,
and
told
him
all
the
truth.
005:034
And
he
said
unto
her,
Daughter,
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole;
go
in
peace,
and
be
whole
of
thy
plague.
005:035
While
he
yet
spake,
there
came
from
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue's
house
certain
which
said,
Thy
daughter
is
dead:
why
troublest
thou
the
Master
any
further?
005:036
As
soon
as
Jesus
heard
the
word
that
was
spoken,
he
saith
unto
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue,
Be
not
afraid,
only
believe.
005:037
And
he
suffered
no
man
to
follow
him,
save
Peter,
and
James,
and
John
the
brother
of
James.
005:038
And
he
cometh
to
the
house
of
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue,
and
seeth
the
tumult,
and
them
that
wept
and
wailed
greatly.
005:039
And
when
he
was
come
in,
he
saith
unto
them,
Why
make
ye
this
ado,
and
weep?
the
damsel
is
not
dead,
but
sleepeth.
005:040
And
they
laughed
him
to
scorn.
But
when
he
had
put
them
all
out,
he
taketh
the
father
and
the
mother
of
the
damsel,
and
them
that
were
with
him,
and
entereth
in
where
the
damsel
was
lying.
005:041
And
he
took
the
damsel
by
the
hand,
and
said
unto
her,
Talitha
cumi;
which
is,
being
interpreted,
Damsel,
I
say
unto
thee,
arise.
005:042
And
straightway
the
damsel
arose,
and
walked;
for
she
was
of
the
age
of
twelve
years.
And
they
were
astonished
with
a
great
astonishment.
005:043
And
he
charged
them
straitly
that
no
man
should
know
it;
and
commanded
that
something
should
be
given
her
to
eat.
006:001
And
he
went
out
from
thence,
and
came
into
his
own
country;
and
his
disciples
follow
him.
006:002
And
when
the
sabbath
day
was
come,
he
began
to
teach
in
the
synagogue:
and
many
hearing
him
were
astonished,
saying,
From
whence
hath
this
man
these
things?
and
what
wisdom
is
this
which
is
given
unto
him,
that
even
such
mighty
works
are
wrought
by
his
hands?
006:003
Is
not
this
the
carpenter,
the
son
of
Mary,
the
brother
of
James,
and
Joses,
and
of
Juda,
and
Simon?
and
are
not
his
sisters
here
with
us?
And
they
were
offended
at
him.
006:004
But
Jesus,
said
unto
them,
A
prophet
is
not
without
honour,
but
in
his
own
country,
and
among
his
own
kin,
and
in
his
own
house.
006:005
And
he
could
there
do
no
mighty
work,
save
that
he
laid
his
hands
upon
a
few
sick
folk,
and
healed
them.
006:006
And
he
marvelled
because
of
their
unbelief.
And
he
went
round
about
the
villages,
teaching.
006:007
And
he
called
unto
him
the
twelve,
and
began
to
send
them
forth
by
two
and
two;
and
gave
them
power
over
unclean
spirits;
006:008
And
commanded
them
that
they
should
take
nothing
for
their
journey,
save
a
staff
only;
no
scrip,
no
bread,
no
money
in
their
purse:
006:009
But
be
shod
with
sandals;
and
not
put
on
two
coats.
006:010
And
he
said
unto
them,
In
what
place
soever
ye
enter
into
an
house,
there
abide
till
ye
depart
from
that
place.
006:011
And
whosoever
shall
not
receive
you,
nor
hear
you,
when
ye
depart
thence,
shake
off
the
dust
under
your
feet
for
a
testimony
against
them.
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
It
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
Sodom
and
Gomorrha
in
the
day
of
judgment,
than
for
that
city.
006:012
And
they
went
out,
and
preached
that
men
should
repent.
006:013
And
they
cast
out
many
devils,
and
anointed
with
oil
many
that
were
sick,
and
healed
them.
006:014
And
king
Herod
heard
of
him;
(for
his
name
was
spread
abroad:)
and
he
said,
That
John
the
Baptist
was
risen
from
the
dead,
and
therefore
mighty
works
do
shew
forth
themselves
in
him.
006:015
Others
said,
That
it
is
Elias.
And
others
said,
That
it
is
a
prophet,
or
as
one
of
the
prophets.
006:016
But
when
Herod
heard
thereof,
he
said,
It
is
John,
whom
I
beheaded:
he
is
risen
from
the
dead.
006:017
For
Herod
himself
had
sent
forth
and
laid
hold
upon
John,
and
bound
him
in
prison
for
Herodias'
sake,
his
brother
Philip's
wife:
for
he
had
married
her.
006:018
For
John
had
said
unto
Herod,
It
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
have
thy
brother's
wife.
006:019
Therefore
Herodias
had
a
quarrel
against
him,
and
would
have
killed
him;
but
she
could
not:
006:020
For
Herod
feared
John,
knowing
that
he
was
a
just
man
and
an
holy,
and
observed
him;
and
when
he
heard
him,
he
did
many
things,
and
heard
him
gladly.
006:021
And
when
a
convenient
day
was
come,
that
Herod
on
his
birthday
made
a
supper
to
his
lords,
high
captains,
and
chief
estates
of
Galilee;
006:022
And
when
the
daughter
of
the
said
Herodias
came
in,
and
danced,
and
pleased
Herod
and
them
that
sat
with
him,
the
king
said
unto
the
damsel,
Ask
of
me
whatsoever
thou
wilt,
and
I
will
give
it
thee.
006:023
And
he
sware
unto
her,
Whatsoever
thou
shalt
ask
of
me,
I
will
give
it
thee,
unto
the
half
of
my
kingdom.
006:024
And
she
went
forth,
and
said
unto
her
mother,
What
shall
I
ask?
And
she
said,
The
head
of
John
the
Baptist.
006:025
And
she
came
in
straightway
with
haste
unto
the
king,
and
asked,
saying,
I
will
that
thou
give
me
by
and
by
in
a
charger
the
head
of
John
the
Baptist.
006:026
And
the
king
was
exceeding
sorry;
yet
for
his
oath's
sake,
and
for
their
sakes
which
sat
with
him,
he
would
not
reject
her.
006:027
And
immediately
the
king
sent
an
executioner,
and
commanded
his
head
to
be
brought:
and
he
went
and
beheaded
him
in
the
prison,
006:028
And
brought
his
head
in
a
charger,
and
gave
it
to
the
damsel:
and
the
damsel
gave
it
to
her
mother.
006:029
And
when
his
disciples
heard
of
it,
they
came
and
took
up
his
corpse,
and
laid
it
in
a
tomb.
006:030
And
the
apostles
gathered
themselves
together
unto
Jesus,
and
told
him
all
things,
both
what
they
had
done,
and
what
they
had
taught.
006:031
And
he
said
unto
them,
Come
ye
yourselves
apart
into
a
desert
place,
and
rest
a
while:
for
there
were
many
coming
and
going,
and
they
had
no
leisure
so
much
as
to
eat.
006:032
And
they
departed
into
a
desert
place
by
ship
privately.
006:033
And
the
people
saw
them
departing,
and
many
knew
him,
and
ran
afoot
thither
out
of
all
cities,
and
outwent
them,
and
came
together
unto
him.
006:034
And
Jesus,
when
he
came
out,
saw
much
people,
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
them,
because
they
were
as
sheep
not
having
a
shepherd:
and
he
began
to
teach
them
many
things.
006:035
And
when
the
day
was
now
far
spent,
his
disciples
came
unto
him,
and
said,
This
is
a
desert
place,
and
now
the
time
is
far
passed:
006:036
Send
them
away,
that
they
may
go
into
the
country
round
about,
and
into
the
villages,
and
buy
themselves
bread:
for
they
have
nothing
to
eat.
006:037
He
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Give
ye
them
to
eat.
And
they
say
unto
him,
Shall
we
go
and
buy
two
hundred
pennyworth
of
bread,
and
give
them
to
eat?
006:038
He
saith
unto
them,
How
many
loaves
have
ye?
go
and
see.
And
when
they
knew,
they
say,
Five,
and
two
fishes.
006:039
And
he
commanded
them
to
make
all
sit
down
by
companies
upon
the
green
grass.
006:040
And
they
sat
down
in
ranks,
by
hundreds,
and
by
fifties.
006:041
And
when
he
had
taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes,
he
looked
up
to
heaven,
and
blessed,
and
brake
the
loaves,
and
gave
them
to
his
disciples
to
set
before
them;
and
the
two
fishes
divided
he
among
them
all.
006:042
And
they
did
all
eat,
and
were
filled.
006:043
And
they
took
up
twelve
baskets
full
of
the
fragments,
and
of
the
fishes.
006:044
And
they
that
did
eat
of
the
loaves
were
about
five
thousand
men.
006:045
And
straightway
he
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
the
ship,
and
to
go
to
the
other
side
before
unto
Bethsaida,
while
he
sent
away
the
people.
006:046
And
when
he
had
sent
them
away,
he
departed
into
a
mountain
to
pray.
006:047
And
when
even
was
come,
the
ship
was
in
the
midst
of
the
sea,
and
he
alone
on
the
land.
006:048
And
he
saw
them
toiling
in
rowing;
for
the
wind
was
contrary
unto
them:
and
about
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
he
cometh
unto
them,
walking
upon
the
sea,
and
would
have
passed
by
them.
006:049
But
when
they
saw
him
walking
upon
the
sea,
they
supposed
it
had
been
a
spirit,
and
cried
out:
006:050
For
they
all
saw
him,
and
were
troubled.
And
immediately
he
talked
with
them,
and
saith
unto
them,
Be
of
good
cheer:
it
is
I;
be
not
afraid.
006:051
And
he
went
up
unto
them
into
the
ship;
and
the
wind
ceased:
and
they
were
sore
amazed
in
themselves
beyond
measure,
and
wondered.
006:052
For
they
considered
not
the
miracle
of
the
loaves:
for
their
heart
was
hardened.
006:053
And
when
they
had
passed
over,
they
came
into
the
land
of
Gennesaret,
and
drew
to
the
shore.
006:054
And
when
they
were
come
out
of
the
ship,
straightway
they
knew
him,
006:055
And
ran
through
that
whole
region
round
about,
and
began
to
carry
about
in
beds
those
that
were
sick,
where
they
heard
he
was.
006:056
And
whithersoever
he
entered,
into
villages,
or
cities,
or
country,
they
laid
the
sick
in
the
streets,
and
besought
him
that
they
might
touch
if
it
were
but
the
border
of
his
garment:
and
as
many
as
touched
him
were
made
whole.
007:001
Then
came
together
unto
him
the
Pharisees,
and
certain
of
the
scribes,
which
came
from
Jerusalem.
007:002
And
when
they
saw
some
of
his
disciples
eat
bread
with
defiled,
that
is
to
say,
with
unwashen,
hands,
they
found
fault.
007:003
For
the
Pharisees,
and
all
the
Jews,
except
they
wash
their
hands
oft,
eat
not,
holding
the
tradition
of
the
elders.
007:004
And
when
they
come
from
the
market,
except
they
wash,
they
eat
not.
And
many
other
things
there
be,
which
they
have
received
to
hold,
as
the
washing
of
cups,
and
pots,
brasen
vessels,
and
of
tables.
007:005
Then
the
Pharisees
and
scribes
asked
him,
Why
walk
not
thy
disciples
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
elders,
but
eat
bread
with
unwashen
hands?
007:006
He
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Well
hath
Esaias
prophesied
of
you
hypocrites,
as
it
is
written,
This
people
honoureth
me
with
their
lips,
but
their
heart
is
far
from
me.
007:007
Howbeit
in
vain
do
they
worship
me,
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
men.
007:008
For
laying
aside
the
commandment
of
God,
ye
hold
the
tradition
of
men,
as
the
washing
of
pots
and
cups:
and
many
other
such
like
things
ye
do.
007:009
And
he
said
unto
them,
Full
well
ye
reject
the
commandment
of
God,
that
ye
may
keep
your
own
tradition.
007:010
For
Moses
said,
Honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother;
and,
Whoso
curseth
father
or
mother,
let
him
die
the
death:
007:011
But
ye
say,
If
a
man
shall
say
to
his
father
or
mother,
It
is
Corban,
that
is
to
say,
a
gift,
by
whatsoever
thou
mightest
be
profited
by
me;
he
shall
be
free.
007:012
And
ye
suffer
him
no
more
to
do
ought
for
his
father
or
his
mother;
007:013
Making
the
word
of
God
of
none
effect
through
your
tradition,
which
ye
have
delivered:
and
many
such
like
things
do
ye.
007:014
And
when
he
had
called
all
the
people
unto
him,
he
said
unto
them,
Hearken
unto
me
every
one
of
you,
and
understand:
007:015
There
is
nothing
from
without
a
man,
that
