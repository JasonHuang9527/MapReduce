entering
into
him
can
defile
him:
but
the
things
which
come
out
of
him,
those
are
they
that
defile
the
man.
007:016
If
any
man
have
ears
to
hear,
let
him
hear.
007:017
And
when
he
was
entered
into
the
house
from
the
people,
his
disciples
asked
him
concerning
the
parable.
007:018
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Are
ye
so
without
understanding
also?
Do
ye
not
perceive,
that
whatsoever
thing
from
without
entereth
into
the
man,
it
cannot
defile
him;
007:019
Because
it
entereth
not
into
his
heart,
but
into
the
belly,
and
goeth
out
into
the
draught,
purging
all
meats?
007:020
And
he
said,
That
which
cometh
out
of
the
man,
that
defileth
the
man.
007:021
For
from
within,
out
of
the
heart
of
men,
proceed
evil
thoughts,
adulteries,
fornications,
murders,
007:022
Thefts,
covetousness,
wickedness,
deceit,
lasciviousness,
an
evil
eye,
blasphemy,
pride,
foolishness:
007:023
All
these
evil
things
come
from
within,
and
defile
the
man.
007:024
And
from
thence
he
arose,
and
went
into
the
borders
of
Tyre
and
Sidon,
and
entered
into
an
house,
and
would
have
no
man
know
it:
but
he
could
not
be
hid.
007:025
For
a
certain
woman,
whose
young
daughter
had
an
unclean
spirit,
heard
of
him,
and
came
and
fell
at
his
feet:
007:026
The
woman
was
a
Greek,
a
Syrophenician
by
nation;
and
she
besought
him
that
he
would
cast
forth
the
devil
out
of
her
daughter.
007:027
But
Jesus
said
unto
her,
Let
the
children
first
be
filled:
for
it
is
not
meet
to
take
the
children's
bread,
and
to
cast
it
unto
the
dogs.
007:028
And
she
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Yes,
Lord:
yet
the
dogs
under
the
table
eat
of
the
children's
crumbs.
007:029
And
he
said
unto
her,
For
this
saying
go
thy
way;
the
devil
is
gone
out
of
thy
daughter.
007:030
And
when
she
was
come
to
her
house,
she
found
the
devil
gone
out,
and
her
daughter
laid
upon
the
bed.
007:031
And
again,
departing
from
the
coasts
of
Tyre
and
Sidon,
he
came
unto
the
sea
of
Galilee,
through
the
midst
of
the
coasts
of
Decapolis.
007:032
And
they
bring
unto
him
one
that
was
deaf,
and
had
an
impediment
in
his
speech;
and
they
beseech
him
to
put
his
hand
upon
him.
007:033
And
he
took
him
aside
from
the
multitude,
and
put
his
fingers
into
his
ears,
and
he
spit,
and
touched
his
tongue;
007:034
And
looking
up
to
heaven,
he
sighed,
and
saith
unto
him,
Ephphatha,
that
is,
Be
opened.
007:035
And
straightway
his
ears
were
opened,
and
the
string
of
his
tongue
was
loosed,
and
he
spake
plain.
007:036
And
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man:
but
the
more
he
charged
them,
so
much
the
more
a
great
deal
they
published
it;
007:037
And
were
beyond
measure
astonished,
saying,
He
hath
done
all
things
well:
he
maketh
both
the
deaf
to
hear,
and
the
dumb
to
speak.
008:001
In
those
days
the
multitude
being
very
great,
and
having
nothing
to
eat,
Jesus
called
his
disciples
unto
him,
and
saith
unto
them,
008:002
I
have
compassion
on
the
multitude,
because
they
have
now
been
with
me
three
days,
and
have
nothing
to
eat:
008:003
And
if
I
send
them
away
fasting
to
their
own
houses,
they
will
faint
by
the
way:
for
divers
of
them
came
from
far.
008:004
And
his
disciples
answered
him,
From
whence
can
a
man
satisfy
these
men
with
bread
here
in
the
wilderness?
008:005
And
he
asked
them,
How
many
loaves
have
ye?
And
they
said,
Seven.
008:006
And
he
commanded
the
people
to
sit
down
on
the
ground:
and
he
took
the
seven
loaves,
and
gave
thanks,
and
brake,
and
gave
to
his
disciples
to
set
before
them;
and
they
did
set
them
before
the
people.
008:007
And
they
had
a
few
small
fishes:
and
he
blessed,
and
commanded
to
set
them
also
before
them.
008:008
So
they
did
eat,
and
were
filled:
and
they
took
up
of
the
broken
meat
that
was
left
seven
baskets.
008:009
And
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
four
thousand:
and
he
sent
them
away.
008:010
And
straightway
he
entered
into
a
ship
with
his
disciples,
and
came
into
the
parts
of
Dalmanutha.
008:011
And
the
Pharisees
came
forth,
and
began
to
question
with
him,
seeking
of
him
a
sign
from
heaven,
tempting
him.
008:012
And
he
sighed
deeply
in
his
spirit,
and
saith,
Why
doth
this
generation
seek
after
a
sign?
verily
I
say
unto
you,
There
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
this
generation.
008:013
And
he
left
them,
and
entering
into
the
ship
again
departed
to
the
other
side.
008:014
Now
the
disciples
had
forgotten
to
take
bread,
neither
had
they
in
the
ship
with
them
more
than
one
loaf.
008:015
And
he
charged
them,
saying,
Take
heed,
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees,
and
of
the
leaven
of
Herod.
008:016
And
they
reasoned
among
themselves,
saying,
It
is
because
we
have
no
bread.
008:017
And
when
Jesus
knew
it,
he
saith
unto
them,
Why
reason
ye,
because
ye
have
no
bread?
perceive
ye
not
yet,
neither
understand?
have
ye
your
heart
yet
hardened?
008:018
Having
eyes,
see
ye
not?
and
having
ears,
hear
ye
not?
and
do
ye
not
remember?
008:019
When
I
brake
the
five
loaves
among
five
thousand,
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
took
ye
up?
They
say
unto
him,
Twelve.
008:020
And
when
the
seven
among
four
thousand,
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
took
ye
up?
And
they
said,
Seven.
008:021
And
he
said
unto
them,
How
is
it
that
ye
do
not
understand?
008:022
And
he
cometh
to
Bethsaida;
and
they
bring
a
blind
man
unto
him,
and
besought
him
to
touch
him.
008:023
And
he
took
the
blind
man
by
the
hand,
and
led
him
out
of
the
town;
and
when
he
had
spit
on
his
eyes,
and
put
his
hands
upon
him,
he
asked
him
if
he
saw
ought.
008:024
And
he
looked
up,
and
said,
I
see
men
as
trees,
walking.
008:025
After
that
he
put
his
hands
again
upon
his
eyes,
and
made
him
look
up:
and
he
was
restored,
and
saw
every
man
clearly.
008:026
And
he
sent
him
away
to
his
house,
saying,
Neither
go
into
the
town,
nor
tell
it
to
any
in
the
town.
008:027
And
Jesus
went
out,
and
his
disciples,
into
the
towns
of
Caesarea
Philippi:
and
by
the
way
he
asked
his
disciples,
saying
unto
them,
Whom
do
men
say
that
I
am?
008:028
And
they
answered,
John
the
Baptist;
but
some
say,
Elias;
and
others,
One
of
the
prophets.
008:029
And
he
saith
unto
them,
But
whom
say
ye
that
I
am?
And
Peter
answereth
and
saith
unto
him,
Thou
art
the
Christ.
008:030
And
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
of
him.
008:031
And
he
began
to
teach
them,
that
the
Son
of
man
must
suffer
many
things,
and
be
rejected
of
the
elders,
and
of
the
chief
priests,
and
scribes,
and
be
killed,
and
after
three
days
rise
again.
008:032
And
he
spake
that
saying
openly.
And
Peter
took
him,
and
began
to
rebuke
him.
008:033
But
when
he
had
turned
about
and
looked
on
his
disciples,
he
rebuked
Peter,
saying,
Get
thee
behind
me,
Satan:
for
thou
savourest
not
the
things
that
be
of
God,
but
the
things
that
be
of
men.
008:034
And
when
he
had
called
the
people
unto
him
with
his
disciples
also,
he
said
unto
them,
Whosoever
will
come
after
me,
let
him
deny
himself,
and
take
up
his
cross,
and
follow
me.
008:035
For
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it;
but
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
and
the
gospel's,
the
same
shall
save
it.
008:036
For
what
shall
it
profit
a
man,
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
world,
and
lose
his
own
soul?
008:037
Or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul?
008:038
Whosoever
therefore
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words
in
this
adulterous
and
sinful
generation;
of
him
also
shall
the
Son
of
man
be
ashamed,
when
he
cometh
in
the
glory
of
his
Father
with
the
holy
angels.
009:001
And
he
said
unto
them,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
That
there
be
some
of
them
that
stand
here,
which
shall
not
taste
of
death,
till
they
have
seen
the
kingdom
of
God
come
with
power.
009:002
And
after
six
days
Jesus
taketh
with
him
Peter,
and
James,
and
John,
and
leadeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
apart
by
themselves:
and
he
was
transfigured
before
them.
009:003
And
his
raiment
became
shining,
exceeding
white
as
snow;
so
as
no
fuller
on
earth
can
white
them.
009:004
And
there
appeared
unto
them
Elias
with
Moses:
and
they
were
talking
with
Jesus.
009:005
And
Peter
answered
and
said
to
Jesus,
Master,
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here:
and
let
us
make
three
tabernacles;
one
for
thee,
and
one
for
Moses,
and
one
for
Elias.
009:006
For
he
wist
not
what
to
say;
for
they
were
sore
afraid.
009:007
And
there
was
a
cloud
that
overshadowed
them:
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
cloud,
saying,
This
is
my
beloved
Son:
hear
him.
009:008
And
suddenly,
when
they
had
looked
round
about,
they
saw
no
man
any
more,
save
Jesus
only
with
themselves.
009:009
And
as
they
came
down
from
the
mountain,
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
what
things
they
had
seen,
till
the
Son
of
man
were
risen
from
the
dead.
009:010
And
they
kept
that
saying
with
themselves,
questioning
one
with
another
what
the
rising
from
the
dead
should
mean.
009:011
And
they
asked
him,
saying,
Why
say
the
scribes
that
Elias
must
first
come?
009:012
And
he
answered
and
told
them,
Elias
verily
cometh
first,
and
restoreth
all
things;
and
how
it
is
written
of
the
Son
of
man,
that
he
must
suffer
many
things,
and
be
set
at
nought.
009:013
But
I
say
unto
you,
That
Elias
is
indeed
come,
and
they
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
listed,
as
it
is
written
of
him.
009:014
And
when
he
came
to
his
disciples,
he
saw
a
great
multitude
about
them,
and
the
scribes
questioning
with
them.
009:015
And
straightway
all
the
people,
when
they
beheld
him,
were
greatly
amazed,
and
running
to
him
saluted
him.
009:016
And
he
asked
the
scribes,
What
question
ye
with
them?
009:017
And
one
of
the
multitude
answered
and
said,
Master,
I
have
brought
unto
thee
my
son,
which
hath
a
dumb
spirit;
009:018
And
wheresoever
he
taketh
him,
he
teareth
him:
and
he
foameth,
and
gnasheth
with
his
teeth,
and
pineth
away:
and
I
spake
to
thy
disciples
that
they
should
cast
him
out;
and
they
could
not.
009:019
He
answereth
him,
and
saith,
O
faithless
generation,
how
long
shall
I
be
with
you?
how
long
shall
I
suffer
you?
bring
him
unto
me.
009:020
And
they
brought
him
unto
him:
and
when
he
saw
him,
straightway
the
spirit
tare
him;
and
he
fell
on
the
ground,
and
wallowed
foaming.
009:021
And
he
asked
his
father,
How
long
is
it
ago
since
this
came
unto
him?
And
he
said,
Of
a
child.
009:022
And
ofttimes
it
hath
cast
him
into
the
fire,
and
into
the
waters,
to
destroy
him:
but
if
thou
canst
do
any
thing,
have
compassion
on
us,
and
help
us.
009:023
Jesus
said
unto
him,
If
thou
canst
believe,
all
things
are
possible
to
him
that
believeth.
009:024
And
straightway
the
father
of
the
child
cried
out,
and
said
with
tears,
Lord,
I
believe;
help
thou
mine
unbelief.
009:025
When
Jesus
saw
that
the
people
came
running
together,
he
rebuked
the
foul
spirit,
saying
unto
him,
Thou
dumb
and
deaf
spirit,
I
charge
thee,
come
out
of
him,
and
enter
no
more
into
him.
009:026
And
the
spirit
cried,
and
rent
him
sore,
and
came
out
of
him:
and
he
was
as
one
dead;
insomuch
that
many
said,
He
is
dead.
009:027
But
Jesus
took
him
by
the
hand,
and
lifted
him
up;
and
he
arose.
009:028
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
house,
his
disciples
asked
him
privately,
Why
could
not
we
cast
him
out?
009:029
And
he
said
unto
them,
This
kind
can
come
forth
by
nothing,
but
by
prayer
and
fasting.
009:030
And
they
departed
thence,
and
passed
through
Galilee;
and
he
would
not
that
any
man
should
know
it.
009:031
For
he
taught
his
disciples,
and
said
unto
them,
The
Son
of
man
is
delivered
into
the
hands
of
men,
and
they
shall
kill
him;
and
after
that
he
is
killed,
he
shall
rise
the
third
day.
009:032
But
they
understood
not
that
saying,
and
were
afraid
to
ask
him.
009:033
And
he
came
to
Capernaum:
and
being
in
the
house
he
asked
them,
What
was
it
that
ye
disputed
among
yourselves
by
the
way?
009:034
But
they
held
their
peace:
for
by
the
way
they
had
disputed
among
themselves,
who
should
be
the
greatest.
009:035
And
he
sat
down,
and
called
the
twelve,
and
saith
unto
them,
If
any
man
desire
to
be
first,
the
same
shall
be
last
of
all,
and
servant
of
all.
009:036
And
he
took
a
child,
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them:
and
when
he
had
taken
him
in
his
arms,
he
said
unto
them,
009:037
Whosoever
shall
receive
one
of
such
children
in
my
name,
receiveth
me:
and
whosoever
shall
receive
me,
receiveth
not
me,
but
him
that
sent
me.
009:038
And
John
answered
him,
saying,
Master,
we
saw
one
casting
out
devils
in
thy
name,
and
he
followeth
not
us:
and
we
forbad
him,
because
he
followeth
not
us.
009:039
But
Jesus
said,
Forbid
him
not:
for
there
is
no
man
which
shall
do
a
miracle
in
my
name,
that
can
lightly
speak
evil
of
me.
009:040
For
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
on
our
part.
009:041
For
whosoever
shall
give
you
a
cup
of
water
to
drink
in
my
name,
because
ye
belong
to
Christ,
verily
I
say
unto
you,
he
shall
not
lose
his
reward.
009:042
And
whosoever
shall
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
that
believe
in
me,
it
is
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck,
and
he
were
cast
into
the
sea.
009:043
And
if
thy
hand
offend
thee,
cut
it
off:
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
maimed,
than
having
two
hands
to
go
into
hell,
into
the
fire
that
never
shall
be
quenched:
009:044
Where
their
worm
dieth
not,
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched.
009:045
And
if
thy
foot
offend
thee,
cut
it
off:
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
halt
into
life,
than
having
two
feet
to
be
cast
into
hell,
into
the
fire
that
never
shall
be
quenched:
009:046
Where
their
worm
dieth
not,
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched.
009:047
And
if
thine
eye
offend
thee,
pluck
it
out:
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God
with
one
eye,
than
having
two
eyes
to
be
cast
into
hell
fire:
009:048
Where
their
worm
dieth
not,
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched.
009:049
For
every
one
shall
be
salted
with
fire,
and
every
sacrifice
shall
be
salted
with
salt.
009:050
Salt
is
good:
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
saltness,
wherewith
will
ye
season
it?
Have
salt
in
yourselves,
and
have
peace
one
with
another.
010:001
And
he
arose
from
thence,
and
cometh
into
the
coasts
of
Judaea
by
the
farther
side
of
Jordan:
and
the
people
resort
unto
him
again;
and,
as
he
was
wont,
he
taught
them
again.
010:002
And
the
Pharisees
came
to
him,
and
asked
him,
Is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife?
tempting
him.
010:003
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
them,
What
did
Moses
command
you?
010:004
And
they
said,
Moses
suffered
to
write
a
bill
of
divorcement,
and
to
put
her
away.
010:005
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
For
the
hardness
of
your
heart
he
wrote
you
this
precept.
010:006
But
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
God
made
them
male
and
female.
010:007
For
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
mother,
and
cleave
to
his
wife;
010:008
And
they
twain
shall
be
one
flesh:
so
then
they
are
no
more
twain,
but
one
flesh.
010:009
What
therefore
God
hath
joined
together,
let
not
man
put
asunder.
010:010
And
in
the
house
his
disciples
asked
him
again
of
the
same
matter.
010:011
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife,
and
marry
another,
committeth
adultery
against
her.
010:012
And
if
a
woman
shall
put
away
her
husband,
and
be
married
to
another,
she
committeth
adultery.
010:013
And
they
brought
young
children
to
him,
that
he
should
touch
them:
and
his
disciples
rebuked
those
that
brought
them.
010:014
But
when
Jesus
saw
it,
he
was
much
displeased,
and
said
unto
them,
Suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me,
and
forbid
them
not:
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
God.
010:015
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
God
as
a
little
child,
he
shall
not
enter
therein.
010:016
And
he
took
them
up
in
his
arms,
put
his
hands
upon
them,
and
blessed
them.
010:017
And
when
he
was
gone
forth
into
the
way,
there
came
one
running,
and
kneeled
to
him,
and
asked
him,
Good
Master,
what
shall
I
do
that
I
may
inherit
eternal
life?
010:018
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Why
callest
thou
me
good?
there
is
none
good
but
one,
that
is,
God.
010:019
Thou
knowest
the
commandments,
Do
not
commit
adultery,
Do
not
kill,
Do
not
steal,
Do
not
bear
false
witness,
Defraud
not,
Honour
thy
father
and
mother.
010:020
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Master,
all
these
have
I
observed
from
my
youth.
010:021
Then
Jesus
beholding
him
loved
him,
and
said
unto
him,
One
thing
thou
lackest:
go
thy
way,
sell
whatsoever
thou
hast,
and
give
to
the
poor,
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven:
and
come,
take
up
the
cross,
and
follow
me.
010:022
And
he
was
sad
at
that
saying,
and
went
away
grieved:
for
he
had
great
possessions.
010:023
And
Jesus
looked
round
about,
and
saith
unto
his
disciples,
How
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God!
010:024
And
the
disciples
were
astonished
at
his
words.
But
Jesus
answereth
again,
and
saith
unto
them,
Children,
how
hard
is
it
for
them
that
trust
in
riches
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God!
010:025
It
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle,
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God.
010:026
And
they
were
astonished
out
of
measure,
saying
among
themselves,
Who
then
can
be
saved?
010:027
And
Jesus
looking
upon
them
saith,
With
men
it
is
impossible,
but
not
with
God:
for
with
God
all
things
are
possible.
010:028
Then
Peter
began
to
say
unto
him,
Lo,
we
have
left
all,
and
have
followed
thee.
010:029
And
Jesus
answered
and
said,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
There
is
no
man
that
hath
left
house,
or
brethren,
or
sisters,
or
father,
or
mother,
or
wife,
or
children,
or
lands,
for
my
sake,
and
the
gospel's,
010:030
But
he
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
now
in
this
time,
houses,
and
brethren,
and
sisters,
and
mothers,
and
children,
and
lands,
with
persecutions;
and
in
the
world
to
come
eternal
life.
010:031
But
many
that
are
first
shall
be
last;
and
the
last
first.
010:032
And
they
were
in
the
way
going
up
to
Jerusalem;
and
Jesus
went
before
them:
and
they
were
amazed;
and
as
they
followed,
they
were
afraid.
And
he
took
again
the
twelve,
and
began
to
tell
them
what
things
should
happen
unto
him,
010:033
Saying,
Behold,
we
go
up
to
Jerusalem;
and
the
Son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
chief
priests,
and
unto
the
scribes;
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
death,
and
shall
deliver
him
to
the
Gentiles:
010:034
And
they
shall
mock
him,
and
shall
scourge
him,
and
shall
spit
upon
him,
and
shall
kill
him:
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
again.
010:035
And
James
and
John,
the
sons
of
Zebedee,
come
unto
him,
saying,
Master,
we
would
that
thou
shouldest
do
for
us
whatsoever
we
shall
desire.
010:036
And
he
said
unto
them,
What
would
ye
that
I
should
do
for
you?
010:037
They
said
unto
him,
Grant
unto
us
that
we
may
sit,
one
on
thy
right
hand,
and
the
other
on
thy
left
hand,
in
thy
glory.
010:038
But
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Ye
know
not
what
ye
ask:
can
ye
drink
of
the
cup
that
I
drink
of?
and
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
I
am
baptized
with?
010:039
And
they
said
unto
him,
We
can.
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Ye
shall
indeed
drink
of
the
cup
that
I
drink
of;
and
with
the
baptism
that
I
am
baptized
withal
shall
ye
be
baptized:
010:040
But
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
and
on
my
left
hand
is
not
mine
to
give;
but
it
shall
be
given
to
them
for
whom
it
is
prepared.
010:041
And
when
the
ten
heard
it,
they
began
to
be
much
displeased
with
James
and
John.
010:042
But
Jesus
called
them
to
him,
and
saith
unto
them,
Ye
know
that
they
which
are
accounted
to
rule
over
the
Gentiles
exercise
lordship
over
them;
and
their
great
ones
exercise
authority
upon
them.
010:043
But
so
shall
it
not
be
among
you:
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
you,
shall
be
your
minister:
010:044
And
whosoever
of
you
will
be
the
chiefest,
shall
be
servant
of
all.
010:045
For
even
the
Son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
unto,
but
to
minister,
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
many.
010:046
And
they
came
to
Jericho:
and
as
he
went
out
of
Jericho
with
his
disciples
and
a
great
number
of
people,
blind
Bartimaeus,
the
son
of
Timaeus,
sat
by
the
highway
side
begging.
010:047
And
when
he
heard
that
it
was
Jesus
of
Nazareth,
he
began
to
cry
out,
and
say,
Jesus,
thou
son
of
David,
have
mercy
on
me.
010:048
And
many
charged
him
that
he
should
hold
his
peace:
but
he
cried
the
more
a
great
deal,
Thou
son
of
David,
have
mercy
on
me.
010:049
And
Jesus
stood
still,
and
commanded
him
to
be
called.
And
they
call
the
blind
man,
saying
unto
him,
Be
of
good
comfort,
rise;
he
calleth
thee.
010:050
And
he,
casting
away
his
garment,
rose,
and
came
to
Jesus.
010:051
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
What
wilt
thou
that
I
should
do
unto
thee?
The
blind
man
said
unto
him,
Lord,
that
I
might
receive
my
sight.
010:052
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Go
thy
way;
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole.
And
immediately
he
received
his
sight,
and
followed
Jesus
in
the
way.
011:001
And
when
they
came
nigh
to
Jerusalem,
unto
Bethphage
and
Bethany,
at
the
mount
of
Olives,
he
sendeth
forth
two
of
his
disciples,
011:002
And
saith
unto
them,
Go
your
way
into
the
village
over
against
you:
and
as
soon
as
ye
be
entered
into
it,
ye
shall
find
a
colt
tied,
whereon
never
man
sat;
loose
him,
and
bring
him.
011:003
And
if
any
man
say
unto
you,
Why
do
ye
this?
say
ye
that
the
Lord
hath
need
of
him;
and
straightway
he
will
send
him
hither.
011:004
And
they
went
their
way,
and
found
the
colt
tied
by
the
door
without
in
a
place
where
two
ways
met;
and
they
loose
him.
011:005
And
certain
of
them
that
stood
there
said
unto
them,
What
do
ye,
loosing
the
colt?
011:006
And
they
said
unto
them
even
as
Jesus
had
commanded:
and
they
let
them
go.
011:007
And
they
brought
the
colt
to
Jesus,
and
cast
their
garments
on
him;
and
he
sat
upon
him.
011:008
And
many
spread
their
garments
in
the
way:
and
others
cut
down
branches
off
the
trees,
and
strawed
them
in
the
way.
011:009
And
they
that
went
before,
and
they
that
followed,
cried,
saying,
Hosanna;
Blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Lord:
011:010
Blessed
be
the
kingdom
of
our
father
David,
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Lord:
Hosanna
in
the
highest.
011:011
And
Jesus
entered
