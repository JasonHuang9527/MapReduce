into
Jerusalem,
and
into
the
temple:
and
when
he
had
looked
round
about
upon
all
things,
and
now
the
eventide
was
come,
he
went
out
unto
Bethany
with
the
twelve.
011:012
And
on
the
morrow,
when
they
were
come
from
Bethany,
he
was
hungry:
011:013
And
seeing
a
fig
tree
afar
off
having
leaves,
he
came,
if
haply
he
might
find
any
thing
thereon:
and
when
he
came
to
it,
he
found
nothing
but
leaves;
for
the
time
of
figs
was
not
yet.
011:014
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
it,
No
man
eat
fruit
of
thee
hereafter
for
ever.
And
his
disciples
heard
it.
011:015
And
they
come
to
Jerusalem:
and
Jesus
went
into
the
temple,
and
began
to
cast
out
them
that
sold
and
bought
in
the
temple,
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
the
moneychangers,
and
the
seats
of
them
that
sold
doves;
011:016
And
would
not
suffer
that
any
man
should
carry
any
vessel
through
the
temple.
011:017
And
he
taught,
saying
unto
them,
Is
it
not
written,
My
house
shall
be
called
of
all
nations
the
house
of
prayer?
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves.
011:018
And
the
scribes
and
chief
priests
heard
it,
and
sought
how
they
might
destroy
him:
for
they
feared
him,
because
all
the
people
was
astonished
at
his
doctrine.
011:019
And
when
even
was
come,
he
went
out
of
the
city.
011:020
And
in
the
morning,
as
they
passed
by,
they
saw
the
fig
tree
dried
up
from
the
roots.
011:021
And
Peter
calling
to
remembrance
saith
unto
him,
Master,
behold,
the
fig
tree
which
thou
cursedst
is
withered
away.
011:022
And
Jesus
answering
saith
unto
them,
Have
faith
in
God.
011:023
For
verily
I
say
unto
you,
That
whosoever
shall
say
unto
this
mountain,
Be
thou
removed,
and
be
thou
cast
into
the
sea;
and
shall
not
doubt
in
his
heart,
but
shall
believe
that
those
things
which
he
saith
shall
come
to
pass;
he
shall
have
whatsoever
he
saith.
011:024
Therefore
I
say
unto
you,
What
things
soever
ye
desire,
when
ye
pray,
believe
that
ye
receive
them,
and
ye
shall
have
them.
011:025
And
when
ye
stand
praying,
forgive,
if
ye
have
ought
against
any:
that
your
Father
also
which
is
in
heaven
may
forgive
you
your
trespasses.
011:026
But
if
ye
do
not
forgive,
neither
will
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven
forgive
your
trespasses.
011:027
And
they
come
again
to
Jerusalem:
and
as
he
was
walking
in
the
temple,
there
come
to
him
the
chief
priests,
and
the
scribes,
and
the
elders,
011:028
And
say
unto
him,
By
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things?
and
who
gave
thee
this
authority
to
do
these
things?
011:029
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
I
will
also
ask
of
you
one
question,
and
answer
me,
and
I
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things.
011:030
The
baptism
of
John,
was
it
from
heaven,
or
of
men?
answer
me.
011:031
And
they
reasoned
with
themselves,
saying,
If
we
shall
say,
From
heaven;
he
will
say,
Why
then
did
ye
not
believe
him?
011:032
But
if
we
shall
say,
Of
men;
they
feared
the
people:
for
all
men
counted
John,
that
he
was
a
prophet
indeed.
011:033
And
they
answered
and
said
unto
Jesus,
We
cannot
tell.
And
Jesus
answering
saith
unto
them,
Neither
do
I
tell
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things.
012:001
And
he
began
to
speak
unto
them
by
parables.
A
certain
man
planted
a
vineyard,
and
set
an
hedge
about
it,
and
digged
a
place
for
the
winefat,
and
built
a
tower,
and
let
it
out
to
husbandmen,
and
went
into
a
far
country.
012:002
And
at
the
season
he
sent
to
the
husbandmen
a
servant,
that
he
might
receive
from
the
husbandmen
of
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard.
012:003
And
they
caught
him,
and
beat
him,
and
sent
him
away
empty.
012:004
And
again
he
sent
unto
them
another
servant;
and
at
him
they
cast
stones,
and
wounded
him
in
the
head,
and
sent
him
away
shamefully
handled.
012:005
And
again
he
sent
another;
and
him
they
killed,
and
many
others;
beating
some,
and
killing
some.
012:006
Having
yet
therefore
one
son,
his
wellbeloved,
he
sent
him
also
last
unto
them,
saying,
They
will
reverence
my
son.
012:007
But
those
husbandmen
said
among
themselves,
This
is
the
heir;
come,
let
us
kill
him,
and
the
inheritance
shall
be
our's.
012:008
And
they
took
him,
and
killed
him,
and
cast
him
out
of
the
vineyard.
012:009
What
shall
therefore
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
do?
he
will
come
and
destroy
the
husbandmen,
and
will
give
the
vineyard
unto
others.
012:010
And
have
ye
not
read
this
scripture;
The
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner:
012:011
This
was
the
Lord's
doing,
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
eyes?
012:012
And
they
sought
to
lay
hold
on
him,
but
feared
the
people:
for
they
knew
that
he
had
spoken
the
parable
against
them:
and
they
left
him,
and
went
their
way.
012:013
And
they
send
unto
him
certain
of
the
Pharisees
and
of
the
Herodians,
to
catch
him
in
his
words.
012:014
And
when
they
were
come,
they
say
unto
him,
Master,
we
know
that
thou
art
true,
and
carest
for
no
man:
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
men,
but
teachest
the
way
of
God
in
truth:
Is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
to
Caesar,
or
not?
012:015
Shall
we
give,
or
shall
we
not
give?
But
he,
knowing
their
hypocrisy,
said
unto
them,
Why
tempt
ye
me?
bring
me
a
penny,
that
I
may
see
it.
012:016
And
they
brought
it.
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Whose
is
this
image
and
superscription?
And
they
said
unto
him,
Caesar's.
012:017
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
them,
Render
to
Caesar
the
things
that
are
Caesar's,
and
to
God
the
things
that
are
God's.
And
they
marvelled
at
him.
012:018
Then
come
unto
him
the
Sadducees,
which
say
there
is
no
resurrection;
and
they
asked
him,
saying,
012:019
Master,
Moses
wrote
unto
us,
If
a
man's
brother
die,
and
leave
his
wife
behind
him,
and
leave
no
children,
that
his
brother
should
take
his
wife,
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
brother.
012:020
Now
there
were
seven
brethren:
and
the
first
took
a
wife,
and
dying
left
no
seed.
012:021
And
the
second
took
her,
and
died,
neither
left
he
any
seed:
and
the
third
likewise.
012:022
And
the
seven
had
her,
and
left
no
seed:
last
of
all
the
woman
died
also.
012:023
In
the
resurrection
therefore,
when
they
shall
rise,
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
them?
for
the
seven
had
her
to
wife.
012:024
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
them,
Do
ye
not
therefore
err,
because
ye
know
not
the
scriptures,
neither
the
power
of
God?
012:025
For
when
they
shall
rise
from
the
dead,
they
neither
marry,
nor
are
given
in
marriage;
but
are
as
the
angels
which
are
in
heaven.
012:026
And
as
touching
the
dead,
that
they
rise:
have
ye
not
read
in
the
book
of
Moses,
how
in
the
bush
God
spake
unto
him,
saying,
I
am
the
God
of
Abraham,
and
the
God
of
Isaac,
and
the
God
of
Jacob?
012:027
He
is
not
the
God
of
the
dead,
but
the
God
of
the
living:
ye
therefore
do
greatly
err.
012:028
And
one
of
the
scribes
came,
and
having
heard
them
reasoning
together,
and
perceiving
that
he
had
answered
them
well,
asked
him,
Which
is
the
first
commandment
of
all?
012:029
And
Jesus
answered
him,
The
first
of
all
the
commandments
is,
Hear,
O
Israel;
The
Lord
our
God
is
one
Lord:
012:030
And
thou
shalt
love
the
Lord
thy
God
with
all
thy
heart,
and
with
all
thy
soul,
and
with
all
thy
mind,
and
with
all
thy
strength:
this
is
the
first
commandment.
012:031
And
the
second
is
like,
namely
this,
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself.
There
is
none
other
commandment
greater
than
these.
012:032
And
the
scribe
said
unto
him,
Well,
Master,
thou
hast
said
the
truth:
for
there
is
one
God;
and
there
is
none
other
but
he:
012:033
And
to
love
him
with
all
the
heart,
and
with
all
the
understanding,
and
with
all
the
soul,
and
with
all
the
strength,
and
to
love
his
neighbour
as
himself,
is
more
than
all
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices.
012:034
And
when
Jesus
saw
that
he
answered
discreetly,
he
said
unto
him,
Thou
art
not
far
from
the
kingdom
of
God.
And
no
man
after
that
durst
ask
him
any
question.
012:035
And
Jesus
answered
and
said,
while
he
taught
in
the
temple,
How
say
the
scribes
that
Christ
is
the
son
of
David?
012:036
For
David
himself
said
by
the
Holy
Ghost,
The
LORD
said
to
my
Lord,
Sit
thou
on
my
right
hand,
till
I
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool.
012:037
David
therefore
himself
calleth
him
Lord;
and
whence
is
he
then
his
son?
And
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly.
012:038
And
he
said
unto
them
in
his
doctrine,
Beware
of
the
scribes,
which
love
to
go
in
long
clothing,
and
love
salutations
in
the
marketplaces,
012:039
And
the
chief
seats
in
the
synagogues,
and
the
uppermost
rooms
at
feasts:
012:040
Which
devour
widows'
houses,
and
for
a
pretence
make
long
prayers:
these
shall
receive
greater
damnation.
012:041
And
Jesus
sat
over
against
the
treasury,
and
beheld
how
the
people
cast
money
into
the
treasury:
and
many
that
were
rich
cast
in
much.
012:042
And
there
came
a
certain
poor
widow,
and
she
threw
in
two
mites,
which
make
a
farthing.
012:043
And
he
called
unto
him
his
disciples,
and
saith
unto
them,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
That
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
more
in,
than
all
they
which
have
cast
into
the
treasury:
012:044
For
all
they
did
cast
in
of
their
abundance;
but
she
of
her
want
did
cast
in
all
that
she
had,
even
all
her
living.
013:001
And
as
he
went
out
of
the
temple,
one
of
his
disciples
saith
unto
him,
Master,
see
what
manner
of
stones
and
what
buildings
are
here!
013:002
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
him,
Seest
thou
these
great
buildings?
there
shall
not
be
left
one
stone
upon
another,
that
shall
not
be
thrown
down.
013:003
And
as
he
sat
upon
the
mount
of
Olives
over
against
the
temple,
Peter
and
James
and
John
and
Andrew
asked
him
privately,
013:004
Tell
us,
when
shall
these
things
be?
and
what
shall
be
the
sign
when
all
these
things
shall
be
fulfilled?
013:005
And
Jesus
answering
them
began
to
say,
Take
heed
lest
any
man
deceive
you:
013:006
For
many
shall
come
in
my
name,
saying,
I
am
Christ;
and
shall
deceive
many.
013:007
And
when
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
rumours
of
wars,
be
ye
not
troubled:
for
such
things
must
needs
be;
but
the
end
shall
not
be
yet.
013:008
For
nation
shall
rise
against
nation,
and
kingdom
against
kingdom:
and
there
shall
be
earthquakes
in
divers
places,
and
there
shall
be
famines
and
troubles:
these
are
the
beginnings
of
sorrows.
013:009
But
take
heed
to
yourselves:
for
they
shall
deliver
you
up
to
councils;
and
in
the
synagogues
ye
shall
be
beaten:
and
ye
shall
be
brought
before
rulers
and
kings
for
my
sake,
for
a
testimony
against
them.
013:010
And
the
gospel
must
first
be
published
among
all
nations.
013:011
But
when
they
shall
lead
you,
and
deliver
you
up,
take
no
thought
beforehand
what
ye
shall
speak,
neither
do
ye
premeditate:
but
whatsoever
shall
be
given
you
in
that
hour,
that
speak
ye:
for
it
is
not
ye
that
speak,
but
the
Holy
Ghost.
013:012
Now
the
brother
shall
betray
the
brother
to
death,
and
the
father
the
son;
and
children
shall
rise
up
against
their
parents,
and
shall
cause
them
to
be
put
to
death.
013:013
And
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name's
sake:
but
he
that
shall
endure
unto
the
end,
the
same
shall
be
saved.
013:014
But
when
ye
shall
see
the
abomination
of
desolation,
spoken
of
by
Daniel
the
prophet,
standing
where
it
ought
not,
(let
him
that
readeth
understand,)
then
let
them
that
be
in
Judaea
flee
to
the
mountains:
013:015
And
let
him
that
is
on
the
housetop
not
go
down
into
the
house,
neither
enter
therein,
to
take
any
thing
out
of
his
house:
013:016
And
let
him
that
is
in
the
field
not
turn
back
again
for
to
take
up
his
garment.
013:017
But
woe
to
them
that
are
with
child,
and
to
them
that
give
suck
in
those
days!
013:018
And
pray
ye
that
your
flight
be
not
in
the
winter.
013:019
For
in
those
days
shall
be
affliction,
such
as
was
not
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
which
God
created
unto
this
time,
neither
shall
be.
013:020
And
except
that
the
Lord
had
shortened
those
days,
no
flesh
should
be
saved:
but
for
the
elect's
sake,
whom
he
hath
chosen,
he
hath
shortened
the
days.
013:021
And
then
if
any
man
shall
say
to
you,
Lo,
here
is
Christ;
or,
lo,
he
is
there;
believe
him
not:
013:022
For
false
Christs
and
false
prophets
shall
rise,
and
shall
shew
signs
and
wonders,
to
seduce,
if
it
were
possible,
even
the
elect.
013:023
But
take
ye
heed:
behold,
I
have
foretold
you
all
things.
013:024
But
in
those
days,
after
that
tribulation,
the
sun
shall
be
darkened,
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light,
013:025
And
the
stars
of
heaven
shall
fall,
and
the
powers
that
are
in
heaven
shall
be
shaken.
013:026
And
then
shall
they
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
with
great
power
and
glory.
013:027
And
then
shall
he
send
his
angels,
and
shall
gather
together
his
elect
from
the
four
winds,
from
the
uttermost
part
of
the
earth
to
the
uttermost
part
of
heaven.
013:028
Now
learn
a
parable
of
the
fig
tree;
When
her
branch
is
yet
tender,
and
putteth
forth
leaves,
ye
know
that
summer
is
near:
013:029
So
ye
in
like
manner,
when
ye
shall
see
these
things
come
to
pass,
know
that
it
is
nigh,
even
at
the
doors.
013:030
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
that
this
generation
shall
not
pass,
till
all
these
things
be
done.
013:031
Heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away:
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
away.
013:032
But
of
that
day
and
that
hour
knoweth
no
man,
no,
not
the
angels
which
are
in
heaven,
neither
the
Son,
but
the
Father.
013:033
Take
ye
heed,
watch
and
pray:
for
ye
know
not
when
the
time
is.
013:034
For
the
Son
of
Man
is
as
a
man
taking
a
far
journey,
who
left
his
house,
and
gave
authority
to
his
servants,
and
to
every
man
his
work,
and
commanded
the
porter
to
watch.
013:035
Watch
ye
therefore:
for
ye
know
not
when
the
master
of
the
house
cometh,
at
even,
or
at
midnight,
or
at
the
cockcrowing,
or
in
the
morning:
013:036
Lest
coming
suddenly
he
find
you
sleeping.
013:037
And
what
I
say
unto
you
I
say
unto
all,
Watch.
014:001
After
two
days
was
the
feast
of
the
passover,
and
of
unleavened
bread:
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
sought
how
they
might
take
him
by
craft,
and
put
him
to
death.
014:002
But
they
said,
Not
on
the
feast
day,
lest
there
be
an
uproar
of
the
people.
014:003
And
being
in
Bethany
in
the
house
of
Simon
the
leper,
as
he
sat
at
meat,
there
came
a
woman
having
an
alabaster
box
of
ointment
of
spikenard
very
precious;
and
she
brake
the
box,
and
poured
it
on
his
head.
014:004
And
there
were
some
that
had
indignation
within
themselves,
and
said,
Why
was
this
waste
of
the
ointment
made?
014:005
For
it
might
have
been
sold
for
more
than
three
hundred
pence,
and
have
been
given
to
the
poor.
And
they
murmured
against
her.
014:006
And
Jesus
said,
Let
her
alone;
why
trouble
ye
her?
she
hath
wrought
a
good
work
on
me.
014:007
For
ye
have
the
poor
with
you
always,
and
whensoever
ye
will
ye
may
do
them
good:
but
me
ye
have
not
always.
014:008
She
hath
done
what
she
could:
she
is
come
aforehand
to
anoint
my
body
to
the
burying.
014:009
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
throughout
the
whole
world,
this
also
that
she
hath
done
shall
be
spoken
of
for
a
memorial
of
her.
014:010
And
Judas
Iscariot,
one
of
the
twelve,
went
unto
the
chief
priests,
to
betray
him
unto
them.
014:011
And
when
they
heard
it,
they
were
glad,
and
promised
to
give
him
money.
And
he
sought
how
he
might
conveniently
betray
him.
014:012
And
the
first
day
of
unleavened
bread,
when
they
killed
the
passover,
his
disciples
said
unto
him,
Where
wilt
thou
that
we
go
and
prepare
that
thou
mayest
eat
the
passover?
014:013
And
he
sendeth
forth
two
of
his
disciples,
and
saith
unto
them,
Go
ye
into
the
city,
and
there
shall
meet
you
a
man
bearing
a
pitcher
of
water:
follow
him.
014:014
And
wheresoever
he
shall
go
in,
say
ye
to
the
goodman
of
the
house,
The
Master
saith,
Where
is
the
guestchamber,
where
I
shall
eat
the
passover
with
my
disciples?
014:015
And
he
will
shew
you
a
large
upper
room
furnished
and
prepared:
there
make
ready
for
us.
014:016
And
his
disciples
went
forth,
and
came
into
the
city,
and
found
as
he
had
said
unto
them:
and
they
made
ready
the
passover.
014:017
And
in
the
evening
he
cometh
with
the
twelve.
014:018
And
as
they
sat
and
did
eat,
Jesus
said,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
One
of
you
which
eateth
with
me
shall
betray
me.
014:019
And
they
began
to
be
sorrowful,
and
to
say
unto
him
one
by
one,
Is
it
I?
and
another
said,
Is
it
I?
014:020
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
them,
It
is
one
of
the
twelve,
that
dippeth
with
me
in
the
dish.
014:021
The
Son
of
man
indeed
goeth,
as
it
is
written
of
him:
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
Son
of
man
is
betrayed!
good
were
it
for
that
man
if
he
had
never
been
born.
014:022
And
as
they
did
eat,
Jesus
took
bread,
and
blessed,
and
brake
it,
and
gave
to
them,
and
said,
Take,
eat:
this
is
my
body.
014:023
And
he
took
the
cup,
and
when
he
had
given
thanks,
he
gave
it
to
them:
and
they
all
drank
of
it.
014:024
And
he
said
unto
them,
This
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament,
which
is
shed
for
many.
014:025
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
I
will
drink
no
more
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine,
until
that
day
that
I
drink
it
new
in
the
kingdom
of
God.
014:026
And
when
they
had
sung
an
hymn,
they
went
out
into
the
mount
of
Olives.
014:027
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
All
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
night:
for
it
is
written,
I
will
smite
the
shepherd,
and
the
sheep
shall
be
scattered.
014:028
But
after
that
I
am
risen,
I
will
go
before
you
into
Galilee.
014:029
But
Peter
said
unto
him,
Although
all
shall
be
offended,
yet
will
not
I.
014:030
And
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
Verily
I
say
unto
thee,
That
this
day,
even
in
this
night,
before
the
cock
crow
twice,
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice.
014:031
But
he
spake
the
more
vehemently,
If
I
should
die
with
thee,
I
will
not
deny
thee
in
any
wise.
Likewise
also
said
they
all.
014:032
And
they
came
to
a
place
which
was
named
Gethsemane:
and
he
saith
to
his
disciples,
Sit
ye
here,
while
I
shall
pray.
014:033
And
he
taketh
with
him
Peter
and
James
and
John,
and
began
to
be
sore
amazed,
and
to
be
very
heavy;
014:034
And
saith
unto
them,
My
soul
is
exceeding
sorrowful
unto
death:
tarry
ye
here,
and
watch.
014:035
And
he
went
forward
a
little,
and
fell
on
the
ground,
and
prayed
that,
if
it
were
possible,
the
hour
might
pass
from
him.
014:036
And
he
said,
Abba,
Father,
all
things
are
possible
unto
thee;
take
away
this
cup
from
me:
nevertheless
not
what
I
will,
but
what
thou
wilt.
014:037
And
he
cometh,
and
findeth
them
sleeping,
and
saith
unto
Peter,
Simon,
sleepest
thou?
couldest
not
thou
watch
one
hour?
014:038
Watch
ye
and
pray,
lest
ye
enter
into
temptation.
The
spirit
truly
is
ready,
but
the
flesh
is
weak.
014:039
And
again
he
went
away,
and
prayed,
and
spake
the
same
words.
014:040
And
when
he
returned,
he
found
them
asleep
again,
(for
their
eyes
were
heavy,)
neither
wist
they
what
to
answer
him.
014:041
And
he
cometh
the
third
time,
and
saith
unto
them,
Sleep
on
now,
and
take
your
rest:
it
is
enough,
the
hour
is
come;
behold,
the
Son
of
man
is
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
sinners.
014:042
Rise
up,
let
us
go;
lo,
he
that
betrayeth
me
is
at
hand.
014:043
And
immediately,
while
he
yet
spake,
cometh
Judas,
one
of
the
twelve,
and
with
him
a
great
multitude
with
swords
and
staves,
from
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders.
014:044
And
he
that
betrayed
him
had
given
them
a
token,
saying,
Whomsoever
I
shall
kiss,
that
same
is
he;
take
him,
and
lead
him
away
safely.
014:045
And
as
soon
as
he
was
come,
he
goeth
straightway
to
him,
and
saith,
Master,
master;
and
kissed
him.
014:046
And
they
laid
their
hands
on
him,
and
took
him.
014:047
And
one
of
them
that
stood
by
drew
a
sword,
and
smote
a
servant
of
the
high
priest,
and
cut
off
his
ear.
014:048
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Are
ye
come
out,
as
against
a
thief,
with
swords
and
with
staves
to
take
me?
014:049
I
was
daily
with
you
in
the
temple
teaching,
and
ye
took
me
not:
but
the
scriptures
must
be
fulfilled.
014:050
And
they
all
forsook
him,
and
fled.
014:051
And
there
followed
him
a
certain
young
man,
having
a
linen
cloth
cast
about
his
naked
body;
and
the
young
men
laid
hold
on
him:
014:052
And
he
left
the
linen
cloth,
and
fled
from
them
naked.
014:053
And
they
led
Jesus
away
to
the
high
priest:
and
with
him
were
assembled
all
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes.
014:054
And
Peter
followed
him
afar
off,
even
into
the
palace
of
the
high
priest:
and
he
sat
with
the
servants,
and
warmed
himself
at
the
fire.
014:055
And
the
chief
priests
and
all
the
council
sought
for
witness
against
Jesus
to
put
him
to
death;
and
found
none.
014:056
For
many
bare
false
witness
against
him,
but
their
witness
agreed
not
together.
014:057
And
there
arose
certain,
and
bare
false
witness
against
him,
saying,
014:058
We
heard
him
say,
I
will
destroy
this
temple
that
is
made
with
hands,
and
within
three
days
I
will
build
another
made
without
hands.
014:059
But
neither
so
did
their
witness
agree
together.
014:060
And
the
high
priest
stood
up
in
the
midst,
and
asked
Jesus,
saying,
Answerest
thou
nothing?
what
is
it
which
these
witness
against
thee?
014:061
But
he
held
his
peace,
and
answered
nothing.
Again
the
high
priest
asked
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
the
Christ,
the
Son
of
the
Blessed?
014:062
And
Jesus
said,
I
am:
and
ye
shall
see
the
Son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
power,
and
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven.
014:063
Then
the
high
priest
rent
his
clothes,
and
saith,
What
need
we
any
further
witnesses?
014:064
Ye
have
heard
the
blasphemy:
what
think
ye?
And
they
all
condemned
him
to
be
guilty
of
death.
014:065
And
some
began
to
spit
on
him,
and
to
cover
his
face,
and
to
buffet
him,
and
to
say
unto
him,
Prophesy:
and
the
servants
did
strike
him
with
the
palms
of
their
hands.
014:066
And
as
Peter
was
beneath
in
the
palace,
there
cometh
one
of
the
maids
of
the
high
priest:
014:067
And
when
she
saw
Peter
warming
himself,
she
looked
upon
him,
and
said,
And
thou
also
wast
with
Jesus
of
Nazareth.
014:068
But
he
denied,
saying,
I
know
not,
neither
understand
I
what
thou
sayest.
And
he
went
out
into
the
porch;
and
the
cock
crew.
014:069
And
