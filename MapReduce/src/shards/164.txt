a
maid
saw
him
again,
and
began
to
say
to
them
that
stood
by,
This
is
one
of
them.
014:070
And
he
denied
it
again.
And
a
little
after,
they
that
stood
by
said
again
to
Peter,
Surely
thou
art
one
of
them:
for
thou
art
a
Galilaean,
and
thy
speech
agreeth
thereto.
014:071
But
he
began
to
curse
and
to
swear,
saying,
I
know
not
this
man
of
whom
ye
speak.
014:072
And
the
second
time
the
cock
crew.
And
Peter
called
to
mind
the
word
that
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Before
the
cock
crow
twice,
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice.
And
when
he
thought
thereon,
he
wept.
015:001
And
straightway
in
the
morning
the
chief
priests
held
a
consultation
with
the
elders
and
scribes
and
the
whole
council,
and
bound
Jesus,
and
carried
him
away,
and
delivered
him
to
Pilate.
015:002
And
Pilate
asked
him,
Art
thou
the
King
of
the
Jews?
And
he
answering
said
unto
them,
Thou
sayest
it.
015:003
And
the
chief
priests
accused
him
of
many
things:
but
he
answered
nothing.
015:004
And
Pilate
asked
him
again,
saying,
Answerest
thou
nothing?
behold
how
many
things
they
witness
against
thee.
015:005
But
Jesus
yet
answered
nothing;
so
that
Pilate
marvelled.
015:006
Now
at
that
feast
he
released
unto
them
one
prisoner,
whomsoever
they
desired.
015:007
And
there
was
one
named
Barabbas,
which
lay
bound
with
them
that
had
made
insurrection
with
him,
who
had
committed
murder
in
the
insurrection.
015:008
And
the
multitude
crying
aloud
began
to
desire
him
to
do
as
he
had
ever
done
unto
them.
015:009
But
Pilate
answered
them,
saying,
Will
ye
that
I
release
unto
you
the
King
of
the
Jews?
015:010
For
he
knew
that
the
chief
priests
had
delivered
him
for
envy.
015:011
But
the
chief
priests
moved
the
people,
that
he
should
rather
release
Barabbas
unto
them.
015:012
And
Pilate
answered
and
said
again
unto
them,
What
will
ye
then
that
I
shall
do
unto
him
whom
ye
call
the
King
of
the
Jews?
015:013
And
they
cried
out
again,
Crucify
him.
015:014
Then
Pilate
said
unto
them,
Why,
what
evil
hath
he
done?
And
they
cried
out
the
more
exceedingly,
Crucify
him.
015:015
And
so
Pilate,
willing
to
content
the
people,
released
Barabbas
unto
them,
and
delivered
Jesus,
when
he
had
scourged
him,
to
be
crucified.
015:016
And
the
soldiers
led
him
away
into
the
hall,
called
Praetorium;
and
they
call
together
the
whole
band.
015:017
And
they
clothed
him
with
purple,
and
platted
a
crown
of
thorns,
and
put
it
about
his
head,
015:018
And
began
to
salute
him,
Hail,
King
of
the
Jews!
015:019
And
they
smote
him
on
the
head
with
a
reed,
and
did
spit
upon
him,
and
bowing
their
knees
worshipped
him.
015:020
And
when
they
had
mocked
him,
they
took
off
the
purple
from
him,
and
put
his
own
clothes
on
him,
and
led
him
out
to
crucify
him.
015:021
And
they
compel
one
Simon
a
Cyrenian,
who
passed
by,
coming
out
of
the
country,
the
father
of
Alexander
and
Rufus,
to
bear
his
cross.
015:022
And
they
bring
him
unto
the
place
Golgotha,
which
is,
being
interpreted,
The
place
of
a
skull.
015:023
And
they
gave
him
to
drink
wine
mingled
with
myrrh:
but
he
received
it
not.
015:024
And
when
they
had
crucified
him,
they
parted
his
garments,
casting
lots
upon
them,
what
every
man
should
take.
015:025
And
it
was
the
third
hour,
and
they
crucified
him.
015:026
And
the
superscription
of
his
accusation
was
written
over,
THE
KING
OF
THE
JEWS.
015:027
And
with
him
they
crucify
two
thieves;
the
one
on
his
right
hand,
and
the
other
on
his
left.
015:028
And
the
scripture
was
fulfilled,
which
saith,
And
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors.
015:029
And
they
that
passed
by
railed
on
him,
wagging
their
heads,
and
saying,
Ah,
thou
that
destroyest
the
temple,
and
buildest
it
in
three
days,
015:030
Save
thyself,
and
come
down
from
the
cross.
015:031
Likewise
also
the
chief
priests
mocking
said
among
themselves
with
the
scribes,
He
saved
others;
himself
he
cannot
save.
015:032
Let
Christ
the
King
of
Israel
descend
now
from
the
cross,
that
we
may
see
and
believe.
And
they
that
were
crucified
with
him
reviled
him.
015:033
And
when
the
sixth
hour
was
come,
there
was
darkness
over
the
whole
land
until
the
ninth
hour.
015:034
And
at
the
ninth
hour
Jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
saying,
Eloi,
Eloi,
lama
sabachthani?
which
is,
being
interpreted,
My
God,
my
God,
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me?
015:035
And
some
of
them
that
stood
by,
when
they
heard
it,
said,
Behold,
he
calleth
Elias.
015:036
And
one
ran
and
filled
a
spunge
full
of
vinegar,
and
put
it
on
a
reed,
and
gave
him
to
drink,
saying,
Let
alone;
let
us
see
whether
Elias
will
come
to
take
him
down.
015:037
And
Jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
and
gave
up
the
ghost.
015:038
And
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
from
the
top
to
the
bottom.
015:039
And
when
the
centurion,
which
stood
over
against
him,
saw
that
he
so
cried
out,
and
gave
up
the
ghost,
he
said,
Truly
this
man
was
the
Son
of
God.
015:040
There
were
also
women
looking
on
afar
off:
among
whom
was
Mary
Magdalene,
and
Mary
the
mother
of
James
the
less
and
of
Joses,
and
Salome;
015:041
(Who
also,
when
he
was
in
Galilee,
followed
him,
and
ministered
unto
him;)
and
many
other
women
which
came
up
with
him
unto
Jerusalem.
015:042
And
now
when
the
even
was
come,
because
it
was
the
preparation,
that
is,
the
day
before
the
sabbath,
015:043
Joseph
of
Arimathaea,
an
honourable
counsellor,
which
also
waited
for
the
kingdom
of
God,
came,
and
went
in
boldly
unto
Pilate,
and
craved
the
body
of
Jesus.
015:044
And
Pilate
marvelled
if
he
were
already
dead:
and
calling
unto
him
the
centurion,
he
asked
him
whether
he
had
been
any
while
dead.
015:045
And
when
he
knew
it
of
the
centurion,
he
gave
the
body
to
Joseph.
015:046
And
he
bought
fine
linen,
and
took
him
down,
and
wrapped
him
in
the
linen,
and
laid
him
in
a
sepulchre
which
was
hewn
out
of
a
rock,
and
rolled
a
stone
unto
the
door
of
the
sepulchre.
015:047
And
Mary
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
mother
of
Joses
beheld
where
he
was
laid.
016:001
And
when
the
sabbath
was
past,
Mary
Magdalene,
and
Mary
the
mother
of
James,
and
Salome,
had
bought
sweet
spices,
that
they
might
come
and
anoint
him.
016:002
And
very
early
in
the
morning
the
first
day
of
the
week,
they
came
unto
the
sepulchre
at
the
rising
of
the
sun.
016:003
And
they
said
among
themselves,
Who
shall
roll
us
away
the
stone
from
the
door
of
the
sepulchre?
016:004
And
when
they
looked,
they
saw
that
the
stone
was
rolled
away:
for
it
was
very
great.
016:005
And
entering
into
the
sepulchre,
they
saw
a
young
man
sitting
on
the
right
side,
clothed
in
a
long
white
garment;
and
they
were
affrighted.
016:006
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Be
not
affrighted:
Ye
seek
Jesus
of
Nazareth,
which
was
crucified:
he
is
risen;
he
is
not
here:
behold
the
place
where
they
laid
him.
016:007
But
go
your
way,
tell
his
disciples
and
Peter
that
he
goeth
before
you
into
Galilee:
there
shall
ye
see
him,
as
he
said
unto
you.
016:008
And
they
went
out
quickly,
and
fled
from
the
sepulchre;
for
they
trembled
and
were
amazed:
neither
said
they
any
thing
to
any
man;
for
they
were
afraid.
016:009
Now
when
Jesus
was
risen
early
the
first
day
of
the
week,
he
appeared
first
to
Mary
Magdalene,
out
of
whom
he
had
cast
seven
devils.
016:010
And
she
went
and
told
them
that
had
been
with
him,
as
they
mourned
and
wept.
016:011
And
they,
when
they
had
heard
that
he
was
alive,
and
had
been
seen
of
her,
believed
not.
016:012
After
that
he
appeared
in
another
form
unto
two
of
them,
as
they
walked,
and
went
into
the
country.
016:013
And
they
went
and
told
it
unto
the
residue:
neither
believed
they
them.
016:014
Afterward
he
appeared
unto
the
eleven
as
they
sat
at
meat,
and
upbraided
them
with
their
unbelief
and
hardness
of
heart,
because
they
believed
not
them
which
had
seen
him
after
he
was
risen.
016:015
And
he
said
unto
them,
Go
ye
into
all
the
world,
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature.
016:016
He
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved;
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned.
016:017
And
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe;
In
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
devils;
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues;
016:018
They
shall
take
up
serpents;
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing,
it
shall
not
hurt
them;
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick,
and
they
shall
recover.
016:019
So
then
after
the
Lord
had
spoken
unto
them,
he
was
received
up
into
heaven,
and
sat
on
the
right
hand
of
God.
016:020
And
they
went
forth,
and
preached
every
where,
the
Lord
working
with
them,
and
confirming
the
word
with
signs
following.
Amen.
Book
42	Luke
001:001
Forasmuch
as
many
have
taken
in
hand
to
set
forth
in
order
a
declaration
of
those
things
which
are
most
surely
believed
among
us,
001:002
Even
as
they
delivered
them
unto
us,
which
from
the
beginning
were
eyewitnesses,
and
ministers
of
the
word;
001:003
It
seemed
good
to
me
also,
having
had
perfect
understanding
of
all
things
from
the
very
first,
to
write
unto
thee
in
order,
most
excellent
Theophilus,
001:004
That
thou
mightest
know
the
certainty
of
those
things,
wherein
thou
hast
been
instructed.
001:005
THERE
was
in
the
days
of
Herod,
the
king
of
Judaea,
a
certain
priest
named
Zacharias,
of
the
course
of
Abia:
and
his
wife
was
of
the
daughters
of
Aaron,
and
her
name
was
Elisabeth.
001:006
And
they
were
both
righteous
before
God,
walking
in
all
the
commandments
and
ordinances
of
the
Lord
blameless.
001:007
And
they
had
no
child,
because
that
Elisabeth
was
barren,
and
they
both
were
now
well
stricken
in
years.
001:008
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
while
he
executed
the
priest's
office
before
God
in
the
order
of
his
course,
001:009
According
to
the
custom
of
the
priest's
office,
his
lot
was
to
burn
incense
when
he
went
into
the
temple
of
the
Lord.
001:010
And
the
whole
multitude
of
the
people
were
praying
without
at
the
time
of
incense.
001:011
And
there
appeared
unto
him
an
angel
of
the
Lord
standing
on
the
right
side
of
the
altar
of
incense.
001:012
And
when
Zacharias
saw
him,
he
was
troubled,
and
fear
fell
upon
him.
001:013
But
the
angel
said
unto
him,
Fear
not,
Zacharias:
for
thy
prayer
is
heard;
and
thy
wife
Elisabeth
shall
bear
thee
a
son,
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
John.
001:014
And
thou
shalt
have
joy
and
gladness;
and
many
shall
rejoice
at
his
birth.
001:015
For
he
shall
be
great
in
the
sight
of
the
Lord,
and
shall
drink
neither
wine
nor
strong
drink;
and
he
shall
be
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost,
even
from
his
mother's
womb.
001:016
And
many
of
the
children
of
Israel
shall
he
turn
to
the
Lord
their
God.
001:017
And
he
shall
go
before
him
in
the
spirit
and
power
of
Elias,
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
children,
and
the
disobedient
to
the
wisdom
of
the
just;
to
make
ready
a
people
prepared
for
the
Lord.
001:018
And
Zacharias
said
unto
the
angel,
Whereby
shall
I
know
this?
for
I
am
an
old
man,
and
my
wife
well
stricken
in
years.
001:019
And
the
angel
answering
said
unto
him,
I
am
Gabriel,
that
stand
in
the
presence
of
God;
and
am
sent
to
speak
unto
thee,
and
to
shew
thee
these
glad
tidings.
001:020
And,
behold,
thou
shalt
be
dumb,
and
not
able
to
speak,
until
the
day
that
these
things
shall
be
performed,
because
thou
believest
not
my
words,
which
shall
be
fulfilled
in
their
season.
001:021
And
the
people
waited
for
Zacharias,
and
marvelled
that
he
tarried
so
long
in
the
temple.
001:022
And
when
he
came
out,
he
could
not
speak
unto
them:
and
they
perceived
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
in
the
temple:
for
he
beckoned
unto
them,
and
remained
speechless.
001:023
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
as
soon
as
the
days
of
his
ministration
were
accomplished,
he
departed
to
his
own
house.
001:024
And
after
those
days
his
wife
Elisabeth
conceived,
and
hid
herself
five
months,
saying,
001:025
Thus
hath
the
Lord
dealt
with
me
in
the
days
wherein
he
looked
on
me,
to
take
away
my
reproach
among
men.
001:026
And
in
the
sixth
month
the
angel
Gabriel
was
sent
from
God
unto
a
city
of
Galilee,
named
Nazareth,
001:027
To
a
virgin
espoused
to
a
man
whose
name
was
Joseph,
of
the
house
of
David;
and
the
virgin's
name
was
Mary.
001:028
And
the
angel
came
in
unto
her,
and
said,
Hail,
thou
that
art
highly
favoured,
the
Lord
is
with
thee:
blessed
art
thou
among
women.
001:029
And
when
she
saw
him,
she
was
troubled
at
his
saying,
and
cast
in
her
mind
what
manner
of
salutation
this
should
be.
001:030
And
the
angel
said
unto
her,
Fear
not,
Mary:
for
thou
hast
found
favour
with
God.
001:031
And,
behold,
thou
shalt
conceive
in
thy
womb,
and
bring
forth
a
son,
and
shalt
call
his
name
JESUS.
001:032
He
shall
be
great,
and
shall
be
called
the
Son
of
the
Highest:
and
the
Lord
God
shall
give
unto
him
the
throne
of
his
father
David:
001:033
And
he
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
Jacob
for
ever;
and
of
his
kingdom
there
shall
be
no
end.
001:034
Then
said
Mary
unto
the
angel,
How
shall
this
be,
seeing
I
know
not
a
man?
001:035
And
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
her,
The
Holy
Ghost
shall
come
upon
thee,
and
the
power
of
the
Highest
shall
overshadow
thee:
therefore
also
that
holy
thing
which
shall
be
born
of
thee
shall
be
called
the
Son
of
God.
001:036
And,
behold,
thy
cousin
Elisabeth,
she
hath
also
conceived
a
son
in
her
old
age:
and
this
is
the
sixth
month
with
her,
who
was
called
barren.
001:037
For
with
God
nothing
shall
be
impossible.
001:038
And
Mary
said,
Behold
the
handmaid
of
the
Lord;
be
it
unto
me
according
to
thy
word.
And
the
angel
departed
from
her.
001:039
And
Mary
arose
in
those
days,
and
went
into
the
hill
country
with
haste,
into
a
city
of
Juda;
001:040
And
entered
into
the
house
of
Zacharias,
and
saluted
Elisabeth.
001:041
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
Elisabeth
heard
the
salutation
of
Mary,
the
babe
leaped
in
her
womb;
and
Elisabeth
was
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost:
001:042
And
she
spake
out
with
a
loud
voice,
and
said,
Blessed
art
thou
among
women,
and
blessed
is
the
fruit
of
thy
womb.
001:043
And
whence
is
this
to
me,
that
the
mother
of
my
Lord
should
come
to
me?
001:044
For,
lo,
as
soon
as
the
voice
of
thy
salutation
sounded
in
mine
ears,
the
babe
leaped
in
my
womb
for
joy.
001:045
And
blessed
is
she
that
believed:
for
there
shall
be
a
performance
of
those
things
which
were
told
her
from
the
Lord.
001:046
And
Mary
said,
My
soul
doth
magnify
the
Lord,
001:047
And
my
spirit
hath
rejoiced
in
God
my
Saviour.
001:048
For
he
hath
regarded
the
low
estate
of
his
handmaiden:
for,
behold,
from
henceforth
all
generations
shall
call
me
blessed.
001:049
For
he
that
is
mighty
hath
done
to
me
great
things;
and
holy
is
his
name.
001:050
And
his
mercy
is
on
them
that
fear
him
from
generation
to
generation.
001:051
He
hath
shewed
strength
with
his
arm;
he
hath
scattered
the
proud
in
the
imagination
of
their
hearts.
001:052
He
hath
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seats,
and
exalted
them
of
low
degree.
001:053
He
hath
filled
the
hungry
with
good
things;
and
the
rich
he
hath
sent
empty
away.
001:054
He
hath
holpen
his
servant
Israel,
in
remembrance
of
his
mercy;
001:055
As
he
spake
to
our
fathers,
to
Abraham,
and
to
his
seed
for
ever.
001:056
And
Mary
abode
with
her
about
three
months,
and
returned
to
her
own
house.
001:057
Now
Elisabeth's
full
time
came
that
she
should
be
delivered;
and
she
brought
forth
a
son.
001:058
And
her
neighbours
and
her
cousins
heard
how
the
Lord
had
shewed
great
mercy
upon
her;
and
they
rejoiced
with
her.
001:059
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
on
the
eighth
day
they
came
to
circumcise
the
child;
and
they
called
him
Zacharias,
after
the
name
of
his
father.
001:060
And
his
mother
answered
and
said,
Not
so;
but
he
shall
be
called
John.
001:061
And
they
said
unto
her,
There
is
none
of
thy
kindred
that
is
called
by
this
name.
001:062
And
they
made
signs
to
his
father,
how
he
would
have
him
called.
001:063
And
he
asked
for
a
writing
table,
and
wrote,
saying,
His
name
is
John.
And
they
marvelled
all.
001:064
And
his
mouth
was
opened
immediately,
and
his
tongue
loosed,
and
he
spake,
and
praised
God.
001:065
And
fear
came
on
all
that
dwelt
round
about
them:
and
all
these
sayings
were
noised
abroad
throughout
all
the
hill
country
of
Judaea.
001:066
And
all
they
that
heard
them
laid
them
up
in
their
hearts,
saying,
What
manner
of
child
shall
this
be!
And
the
hand
of
the
Lord
was
with
him.
001:067
And
his
father
Zacharias
was
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost,
and
prophesied,
saying,
001:068
Blessed
be
the
Lord
God
of
Israel;
for
he
hath
visited
and
redeemed
his
people,
001:069
And
hath
raised
up
an
horn
of
salvation
for
us
in
the
house
of
his
servant
David;
001:070
As
he
spake
by
the
mouth
of
his
holy
prophets,
which
have
been
since
the
world
began:
001:071
That
we
should
be
saved
from
our
enemies,
and
from
the
hand
of
all
that
hate
us;
001:072
To
perform
the
mercy
promised
to
our
fathers,
and
to
remember
his
holy
covenant;
001:073
The
oath
which
he
sware
to
our
father
Abraham,
001:074
That
he
would
grant
unto
us,
that
we
being
delivered
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
might
serve
him
without
fear,
001:075
In
holiness
and
righteousness
before
him,
all
the
days
of
our
life.
001:076
And
thou,
child,
shalt
be
called
the
prophet
of
the
Highest:
for
thou
shalt
go
before
the
face
of
the
Lord
to
prepare
his
ways;
001:077
To
give
knowledge
of
salvation
unto
his
people
by
the
remission
of
their
sins,
001:078
Through
the
tender
mercy
of
our
God;
whereby
the
dayspring
from
on
high
hath
visited
us,
001:079
To
give
light
to
them
that
sit
in
darkness
and
in
the
shadow
of
death,
to
guide
our
feet
into
the
way
of
peace.
001:080
And
the
child
grew,
and
waxed
strong
in
spirit,
and
was
in
the
deserts
till
the
day
of
his
shewing
unto
Israel.
002:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days,
that
there
went
out
a
decree
from
Caesar
Augustus
that
all
the
world
should
be
taxed.
002:002
(And
this
taxing
was
first
made
when
Cyrenius
was
governor
of
Syria.)
002:003
And
all
went
to
be
taxed,
every
one
into
his
own
city.
002:004
And
Joseph
also
went
up
from
Galilee,
out
of
the
city
of
Nazareth,
into
Judaea,
unto
the
city
of
David,
which
is
called
Bethlehem;
(because
he
was
of
the
house
and
lineage
of
David:)
002:005
To
be
taxed
with
Mary
his
espoused
wife,
being
great
with
child.
002:006
And
so
it
was,
that,
while
they
were
there,
the
days
were
accomplished
that
she
should
be
delivered.
002:007
And
she
brought
forth
her
firstborn
son,
and
wrapped
him
in
swaddling
clothes,
and
laid
him
in
a
manger;
because
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
the
inn.
002:008
And
there
were
in
the
same
country
shepherds
abiding
in
the
field,
keeping
watch
over
their
flock
by
night.
002:009
And,
lo,
the
angel
of
the
Lord
came
upon
them,
and
the
glory
of
the
Lord
shone
round
about
them:
and
they
were
sore
afraid.
002:010
And
the
angel
said
unto
them,
Fear
not:
for,
behold,
I
bring
you
good
tidings
of
great
joy,
which
shall
be
to
all
people.
002:011
For
unto
you
is
born
this
day
in
the
city
of
David
a
Saviour,
which
is
Christ
the
Lord.
002:012
And
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you;
Ye
shall
find
the
babe
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothes,
lying
in
a
manger.
002:013
And
suddenly
there
was
with
the
angel
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
praising
God,
and
saying,
002:014
Glory
to
God
in
the
highest,
and
on
earth
peace,
good
will
toward
men.
002:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
the
angels
were
gone
away
from
them
into
heaven,
the
shepherds
said
one
to
another,
Let
us
now
go
even
unto
Bethlehem,
and
see
this
thing
which
is
come
to
pass,
which
the
Lord
hath
made
known
unto
us.
002:016
And
they
came
with
haste,
and
found
Mary,
and
Joseph,
and
the
babe
lying
in
a
manger.
002:017
And
when
they
had
seen
it,
they
made
known
abroad
the
saying
which
was
told
them
concerning
this
child.
002:018
And
all
they
that
heard
it
wondered
at
those
things
which
were
told
them
by
the
shepherds.
002:019
But
Mary
kept
all
these
things,
and
pondered
them
in
her
heart.
002:020
And
the
shepherds
returned,
glorifying
and
praising
God
for
all
the
things
that
they
had
heard
and
seen,
as
it
was
told
unto
them.
002:021
And
when
eight
days
were
accomplished
for
the
circumcising
of
the
child,
his
name
was
called
JESUS,
which
was
so
named
of
the
angel
before
he
was
conceived
in
the
womb.
002:022
And
when
the
days
of
her
purification
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
were
accomplished,
they
brought
him
to
Jerusalem,
to
present
him
to
the
Lord;
002:023
(As
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
the
LORD,
Every
male
that
openeth
the
womb
shall
be
called
holy
to
the
Lord;)
002:024
And
to
offer
a
sacrifice
according
to
that
which
is
said
in
the
law
of
the
Lord,
A
pair
of
turtledoves,
or
two
young
pigeons.
002:025
And,
behold,
there
was
a
man
in
Jerusalem,
whose
name
was
Simeon;
and
the
same
man
was
just
and
devout,
waiting
for
the
consolation
of
Israel:
and
the
Holy
Ghost
was
upon
him.
002:026
And
it
was
revealed
unto
him
by
the
Holy
Ghost,
that
he
should
not
see
death,
before
he
had
seen
the
Lord's
Christ.
002:027
And
he
came
by
the
Spirit
into
the
temple:
and
when
the
parents
brought
in
the
child
Jesus,
to
do
for
him
after
the
custom
of
the
law,
002:028
Then
took
he
him
up
in
his
arms,
and
blessed
God,
and
said,
002:029
Lord,
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace,
according
to
thy
word:
002:030
For
mine
eyes
have
seen
thy
salvation,
002:031
Which
thou
hast
prepared
before
the
face
of
all
people;
002:032
A
light
to
lighten
the
Gentiles,
and
the
glory
of
thy
people
Israel.
002:033
And
Joseph
and
his
mother
marvelled
at
those
things
which
were
spoken
of
him.
002:034
And
Simeon
blessed
them,
and
said
unto
Mary
his
mother,
Behold,
this
child
is
set
for
the
fall
and
rising
again
of
many
in
Israel;
and
for
a
sign
which
shall
be
spoken
against;
002:035
(Yea,
a
sword
shall
pierce
through
thy
own
soul
also,)
that
the
thoughts
of
many
hearts
may
be
revealed.
002:036
And
there
was
one
Anna,
a
prophetess,
the
daughter
of
Phanuel,
of
the
tribe
of
Aser:
she
was
of
a
great
age,
and
had
lived
with
an
husband
seven
years
from
her
virginity;
002:037
And
she
was
a
widow
of
about
fourscore
and
four
years,
which
departed
not
from
the
temple,
but
served
God
with
fastings
and
prayers
night
and
day.
002:038
And
she
coming
in
that
instant
gave
thanks
likewise
unto
the
Lord,
and
spake
of
him
to
all
them
that
looked
for
redemption
in
Jerusalem.
002:039
And
when
they
had
performed
all
things
according
to
the
law
of
the
Lord,
they
returned
into
Galilee,
to
their
own
city
Nazareth.
002:040
And
the
child
grew,
and
waxed
strong
in
spirit,
filled
with
wisdom:
and
the
grace
of
God
was
upon
