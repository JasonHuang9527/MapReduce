him.
002:041
Now
his
parents
went
to
Jerusalem
every
year
at
the
feast
of
the
passover.
002:042
And
when
he
was
twelve
years
old,
they
went
up
to
Jerusalem
after
the
custom
of
the
feast.
002:043
And
when
they
had
fulfilled
the
days,
as
they
returned,
the
child
Jesus
tarried
behind
in
Jerusalem;
and
Joseph
and
his
mother
knew
not
of
it.
002:044
But
they,
supposing
him
to
have
been
in
the
company,
went
a
day's
journey;
and
they
sought
him
among
their
kinsfolk
and
acquaintance.
002:045
And
when
they
found
him
not,
they
turned
back
again
to
Jerusalem,
seeking
him.
002:046
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
after
three
days
they
found
him
in
the
temple,
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
doctors,
both
hearing
them,
and
asking
them
questions.
002:047
And
all
that
heard
him
were
astonished
at
his
understanding
and
answers.
002:048
And
when
they
saw
him,
they
were
amazed:
and
his
mother
said
unto
him,
Son,
why
hast
thou
thus
dealt
with
us?
behold,
thy
father
and
I
have
sought
thee
sorrowing.
002:049
And
he
said
unto
them,
How
is
it
that
ye
sought
me?
wist
ye
not
that
I
must
be
about
my
Father's
business?
002:050
And
they
understood
not
the
saying
which
he
spake
unto
them.
002:051
And
he
went
down
with
them,
and
came
to
Nazareth,
and
was
subject
unto
them:
but
his
mother
kept
all
these
sayings
in
her
heart.
002:052
And
Jesus
increased
in
wisdom
and
stature,
and
in
favour
with
God
and
man.
003:001
Now
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
Tiberius
Caesar,
Pontius
Pilate
being
governor
of
Judaea,
and
Herod
being
tetrarch
of
Galilee,
and
his
brother
Philip
tetrarch
of
Ituraea
and
of
the
region
of
Trachonitis,
and
Lysanias
the
tetrarch
of
Abilene,
003:002
Annas
and
Caiaphas
being
the
high
priests,
the
word
of
God
came
unto
John
the
son
of
Zacharias
in
the
wilderness.
003:003
And
he
came
into
all
the
country
about
Jordan,
preaching
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins;
003:004
As
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
words
of
Esaias
the
prophet,
saying,
The
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness,
Prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
Lord,
make
his
paths
straight.
003:005
Every
valley
shall
be
filled,
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
brought
low;
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight,
and
the
rough
ways
shall
be
made
smooth;
003:006
And
all
flesh
shall
see
the
salvation
of
God.
003:007
Then
said
he
to
the
multitude
that
came
forth
to
be
baptized
of
him,
O
generation
of
vipers,
who
hath
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come?
003:008
Bring
forth
therefore
fruits
worthy
of
repentance,
and
begin
not
to
say
within
yourselves,
We
have
Abraham
to
our
father:
for
I
say
unto
you,
That
God
is
able
of
these
stones
to
raise
up
children
unto
Abraham.
003:009
And
now
also
the
axe
is
laid
unto
the
root
of
the
trees:
every
tree
therefore
which
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down,
and
cast
into
the
fire.
003:010
And
the
people
asked
him,
saying,
What
shall
we
do
then?
003:011
He
answereth
and
saith
unto
them,
He
that
hath
two
coats,
let
him
impart
to
him
that
hath
none;
and
he
that
hath
meat,
let
him
do
likewise.
003:012
Then
came
also
publicans
to
be
baptized,
and
said
unto
him,
Master,
what
shall
we
do?
003:013
And
he
said
unto
them,
Exact
no
more
than
that
which
is
appointed
you.
003:014
And
the
soldiers
likewise
demanded
of
him,
saying,
And
what
shall
we
do?
And
he
said
unto
them,
Do
violence
to
no
man,
neither
accuse
any
falsely;
and
be
content
with
your
wages.
003:015
And
as
the
people
were
in
expectation,
and
all
men
mused
in
their
hearts
of
John,
whether
he
were
the
Christ,
or
not;
003:016
John
answered,
saying
unto
them
all,
I
indeed
baptize
you
with
water;
but
one
mightier
than
I
cometh,
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
I
am
not
worthy
to
unloose:
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
Holy
Ghost
and
with
fire:
003:017
Whose
fan
is
in
his
hand,
and
he
will
throughly
purge
his
floor,
and
will
gather
the
wheat
into
his
garner;
but
the
chaff
he
will
burn
with
fire
unquenchable.
003:018
And
many
other
things
in
his
exhortation
preached
he
unto
the
people.
003:019
But
Herod
the
tetrarch,
being
reproved
by
him
for
Herodias
his
brother
Philip's
wife,
and
for
all
the
evils
which
Herod
had
done,
003:020
Added
yet
this
above
all,
that
he
shut
up
John
in
prison.
003:021
Now
when
all
the
people
were
baptized,
it
came
to
pass,
that
Jesus
also
being
baptized,
and
praying,
the
heaven
was
opened,
003:022
And
the
Holy
Ghost
descended
in
a
bodily
shape
like
a
dove
upon
him,
and
a
voice
came
from
heaven,
which
said,
Thou
art
my
beloved
Son;
in
thee
I
am
well
pleased.
003:023
And
Jesus
himself
began
to

(as

004:001
And
Jesus
being
full
of
the
Holy
Ghost
returned
from
Jordan,
and
was
led
by
the
Spirit
into
the
wilderness,
004:002
Being
forty
days
tempted
of
the
devil.
And
in
those
days
he
did
eat
nothing:
and
when
they
were
ended,
he
afterward
hungered.
004:003
And
the
devil
said
unto
him,
If
thou
be
the
Son
of
God,
command
this
stone
that
it
be
made
bread.
004:004
And
Jesus
answered
him,
saying,
It
is
written,
That
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone,
but
by
every
word
of
God.
004:005
And
the
devil,
taking
him
up
into
an
high
mountain,
shewed
unto
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
in
a
moment
of
time.
004:006
And
the
devil
said
unto
him,
All
this
power
will
I
give
thee,
and
the
glory
of
them:
for
that
is
delivered
unto
me;
and
to
whomsoever
I
will
I
give
it.
004:007
If
thou
therefore
wilt
worship
me,
all
shall
be
thine.
004:008
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Get
thee
behind
me,
Satan:
for
it
is
written,
Thou
shalt
worship
the
Lord
thy
God,
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve.
004:009
And
he
brought
him
to
Jerusalem,
and
set
him
on
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple,
and
said
unto
him,
If
thou
be
the
Son
of
God,
cast
thyself
down
from
hence:
004:010
For
it
is
written,
He
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee,
to
keep
thee:
004:011
And
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
thee
up,
lest
at
any
time
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone.
004:012
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
him,
It
is
said,
Thou
shalt
not
tempt
the
Lord
thy
God.
004:013
And
when
the
devil
had
ended
all
the
temptation,
he
departed
from
him
for
a
season.
004:014
And
Jesus
returned
in
the
power
of
the
Spirit
into
Galilee:
and
there
went
out
a
fame
of
him
through
all
the
region
round
about.
004:015
And
he
taught
in
their
synagogues,
being
glorified
of
all.
004:016
And
he
came
to
Nazareth,
where
he
had
been
brought
up:
and,
as
his
custom
was,
he
went
into
the
synagogue
on
the
sabbath
day,
and
stood
up
for
to
read.
004:017
And
there
was
delivered
unto
him
the
book
of
the
prophet
Esaias.
And
when
he
had
opened
the
book,
he
found
the
place
where
it
was
written,
004:018
The
Spirit
of
the
Lord
is
upon
me,
because
he
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor;
he
hath
sent
me
to
heal
the
brokenhearted,
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captives,
and
recovering
of
sight
to
the
blind,
to
set
at
liberty
them
that
are
bruised,
004:019
To
preach
the
acceptable
year
of
the
Lord.
004:020
And
he
closed
the
book,
and
he
gave
it
again
to
the
minister,
and
sat
down.
And
the
eyes
of
all
them
that
were
in
the
synagogue
were
fastened
on
him.
004:021
And
he
began
to
say
unto
them,
This
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears.
004:022
And
all
bare
him
witness,
and
wondered
at
the
gracious
words
which
proceeded
out
of
his
mouth.
And
they
said,
Is
not
this
Joseph's
son?
004:023
And
he
said
unto
them,
Ye
will
surely
say
unto
me
this
proverb,
Physician,
heal
thyself:
whatsoever
we
have
heard
done
in
Capernaum,
do
also
here
in
thy
country.
004:024
And
he
said,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
No
prophet
is
accepted
in
his
own
country.
004:025
But
I
tell
you
of
a
truth,
many
widows
were
in
Israel
in
the
days
of
Elias,
when
the
heaven
was
shut
up
three
years
and
six
months,
when
great
famine
was
throughout
all
the
land;
004:026
But
unto
none
of
them
was
Elias
sent,
save
unto
Sarepta,
a
city
of
Sidon,
unto
a
woman
that
was
a
widow.
004:027
And
many
lepers
were
in
Israel
in
the
time
of
Eliseus
the
prophet;
and
none
of
them
was
cleansed,
saving
Naaman
the
Syrian.
004:028
And
all
they
in
the
synagogue,
when
they
heard
these
things,
were
filled
with
wrath,
004:029
And
rose
up,
and
thrust
him
out
of
the
city,
and
led
him
unto
the
brow
of
the
hill
whereon
their
city
was
built,
that
they
might
cast
him
down
headlong.
004:030
But
he
passing
through
the
midst
of
them
went
his
way,
004:031
And
came
down
to
Capernaum,
a
city
of
Galilee,
and
taught
them
on
the
sabbath
days.
004:032
And
they
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine:
for
his
word
was
with
power.
004:033
And
in
the
synagogue
there
was
a
man,
which
had
a
spirit
of
an
unclean
devil,
and
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice,
004:034
Saying,
Let
us
alone;
what
have
we
to
do
with
thee,
thou
Jesus
of
Nazareth?
art
thou
come
to
destroy
us?
I
know
thee
who
thou
art;
the
Holy
One
of
God.
004:035
And
Jesus
rebuked
him,
saying,
Hold
thy
peace,
and
come
out
of
him.
And
when
the
devil
had
thrown
him
in
the
midst,
he
came
out
of
him,
and
hurt
him
not.
004:036
And
they
were
all
amazed,
and
spake
among
themselves,
saying,
What
a
word
is
this!
for
with
authority
and
power
he
commandeth
the
unclean
spirits,
and
they
come
out.
004:037
And
the
fame
of
him
went
out
into
every
place
of
the
country
round
about.
004:038
And
he
arose
out
of
the
synagogue,
and
entered
into
Simon's
house.
And
Simon's
wife's
mother
was
taken
with
a
great
fever;
and
they
besought
him
for
her.
004:039
And
he
stood
over
her,
and
rebuked
the
fever;
and
it
left
her:
and
immediately
she
arose
and
ministered
unto
them.
004:040
Now
when
the
sun
was
setting,
all
they
that
had
any
sick
with
divers
diseases
brought
them
unto
him;
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
every
one
of
them,
and
healed
them.
004:041
And
devils
also
came
out
of
many,
crying
out,
and
saying,
Thou
art
Christ
the
Son
of
God.
And
he
rebuking
them
suffered
them
not
to
speak:
for
they
knew
that
he
was
Christ.
004:042
And
when
it
was
day,
he
departed
and
went
into
a
desert
place:
and
the
people
sought
him,
and
came
unto
him,
and
stayed
him,
that
he
should
not
depart
from
them.
004:043
And
he
said
unto
them,
I
must
preach
the
kingdom
of
God
to
other
cities
also:
for
therefore
am
I
sent.
004:044
And
he
preached
in
the
synagogues
of
Galilee.
005:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
as
the
people
pressed
upon
him
to
hear
the
word
of
God,
he
stood
by
the
lake
of
Gennesaret,
005:002
And
saw
two
ships
standing
by
the
lake:
but
the
fishermen
were
gone
out
of
them,
and
were
washing
their
nets.
005:003
And
he
entered
into
one
of
the
ships,
which
was
Simon's,
and
prayed
him
that
he
would
thrust
out
a
little
from
the
land.
And
he
sat
down,
and
taught
the
people
out
of
the
ship.
005:004
Now
when
he
had
left
speaking,
he
said
unto
Simon,
Launch
out
into
the
deep,
and
let
down
your
nets
for
a
draught.
005:005
And
Simon
answering
said
unto
him,
Master,
we
have
toiled
all
the
night,
and
have
taken
nothing:
nevertheless
at
thy
word
I
will
let
down
the
net.
005:006
And
when
they
had
this
done,
they
inclosed
a
great
multitude
of
fishes:
and
their
net
brake.
005:007
And
they
beckoned
unto
their
partners,
which
were
in
the
other
ship,
that
they
should
come
and
help
them.
And
they
came,
and
filled
both
the
ships,
so
that
they
began
to
sink.
005:008
When
Simon
Peter
saw
it,
he
fell
down
at
Jesus'
knees,
saying,
Depart
from
me;
for
I
am
a
sinful
man,
O
Lord.
005:009
For
he
was
astonished,
and
all
that
were
with
him,
at
the
draught
of
the
fishes
which
they
had
taken:
005:010
And
so
was
also
James,
and
John,
the
sons
of
Zebedee,
which
were
partners
with
Simon.
And
Jesus
said
unto
Simon,
Fear
not;
from
henceforth
thou
shalt
catch
men.
005:011
And
when
they
had
brought
their
ships
to
land,
they
forsook
all,
and
followed
him.
005:012
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
was
in
a
certain
city,
behold
a
man
full
of
leprosy:
who
seeing
Jesus
fell
on
his
face,
and
besought
him,
saying,
Lord,
if
thou
wilt,
thou
canst
make
me
clean.
005:013
And
he
put
forth
his
hand,
and
touched
him,
saying,
I
will:
be
thou
clean.
And
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
him.
005:014
And
he
charged
him
to
tell
no
man:
but
go,
and
shew
thyself
to
the
priest,
and
offer
for
thy
cleansing,
according
as
Moses
commanded,
for
a
testimony
unto
them.
005:015
But
so
much
the
more
went
there
a
fame
abroad
of
him:
and
great
multitudes
came
together
to
hear,
and
to
be
healed
by
him
of
their
infirmities.
005:016
And
he
withdrew
himself
into
the
wilderness,
and
prayed.
005:017
And
it
came
to
pass
on
a
certain
day,
as
he
was
teaching,
that
there
were
Pharisees
and
doctors
of
the
law
sitting
by,
which
were
come
out
of
every
town
of
Galilee,
and
Judaea,
and
Jerusalem:
and
the
power
of
the
Lord
was
present
to
heal
them.
005:018
And,
behold,
men
brought
in
a
bed
a
man
which
was
taken
with
a
palsy:
and
they
sought
means
to
bring
him
in,
and
to
lay
him
before
him.
005:019
And
when
they
could
not
find
by
what
way
they
might
bring
him
in
because
of
the
multitude,
they
went
upon
the
housetop,
and
let
him
down
through
the
tiling
with
his
couch
into
the
midst
before
Jesus.
005:020
And
when
he
saw
their
faith,
he
said
unto
him,
Man,
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee.
005:021
And
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
began
to
reason,
saying,
Who
is
this
which
speaketh
blasphemies?
Who
can
forgive
sins,
but
God
alone?
005:022
But
when
Jesus
perceived
their
thoughts,
he
answering
said
unto
them,
What
reason
ye
in
your
hearts?
005:023
Whether
is
easier,
to
say,
Thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee;
or
to
say,
Rise
up
and
walk?
005:024
But
that
ye
may
know
that
the
Son
of
man
hath
power
upon
earth
to
forgive
sins,
(he
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
palsy,)
I
say
unto
thee,
Arise,
and
take
up
thy
couch,
and
go
into
thine
house.
005:025
And
immediately
he
rose
up
before
them,
and
took
up
that
whereon
he
lay,
and
departed
to
his
own
house,
glorifying
God.
005:026
And
they
were
all
amazed,
and
they
glorified
God,
and
were
filled
with
fear,
saying,
We
have
seen
strange
things
to
day.
005:027
And
after
these
things
he
went
forth,
and
saw
a
publican,
named
Levi,
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
custom:
and
he
said
unto
him,
Follow
me.
005:028
And
he
left
all,
rose
up,
and
followed
him.
005:029
And
Levi
made
him
a
great
feast
in
his
own
house:
and
there
was
a
great
company
of
publicans
and
of
others
that
sat
down
with
them.
005:030
But
their
scribes
and
Pharisees
murmured
against
his
disciples,
saying,
Why
do
ye
eat
and
drink
with
publicans
and
sinners?
005:031
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
them,
They
that
are
whole
need
not
a
physician;
but
they
that
are
sick.
005:032
I
came
not
to
call
the
righteous,
but
sinners
to
repentance.
005:033
And
they
said
unto
him,
Why
do
the
disciples
of
John
fast
often,
and
make
prayers,
and
likewise
the
disciples
of
the
Pharisees;
but
thine
eat
and
drink?
005:034
And
he
said
unto
them,
Can
ye
make
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
fast,
while
the
bridegroom
is
with
them?
005:035
But
the
days
will
come,
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
away
from
them,
and
then
shall
they
fast
in
those
days.
005:036
And
he
spake
also
a
parable
unto
them;
No
man
putteth
a
piece
of
a
new
garment
upon
an
old;
if
otherwise,
then
both
the
new
maketh
a
rent,
and
the
piece
that
was
taken
out
of
the
new
agreeth
not
with
the
old.
005:037
And
no
man
putteth
new
wine
into
old
bottles;
else
the
new
wine
will
burst
the
bottles,
and
be
spilled,
and
the
bottles
shall
perish.
005:038
But
new
wine
must
be
put
into
new
bottles;
and
both
are
preserved.
005:039
No
man
also
having
drunk
old
wine
straightway
desireth
new:
for
he
saith,
The
old
is
better.
006:001
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
second
sabbath
after
the
first,
that
he
went
through
the
corn
fields;
and
his
disciples
plucked
the
ears
of
corn,
and
did
eat,
rubbing
them
in
their
hands.
006:002
And
certain
of
the
Pharisees
said
unto
them,
Why
do
ye
that
which
is
not
lawful
to
do
on
the
sabbath
days?
006:003
And
Jesus
answering
them
said,
Have
ye
not
read
so
much
as
this,
what
David
did,
when
himself
was
an
hungred,
and
they
which
were
with
him;
006:004
How
he
went
into
the
house
of
God,
and
did
take
and
eat
the
shewbread,
and
gave
also
to
them
that
were
with
him;
which
it
is
not
lawful
to
eat
but
for
the
priests
alone?
006:005
And
he
said
unto
them,
That
the
Son
of
man
is
Lord
also
of
the
sabbath.
006:006
And
it
came
to
pass
also
on
another
sabbath,
that
he
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
taught:
and
there
was
a
man
whose
right
hand
was
withered.
006:007
And
the
scribes
and
Pharisees
watched
him,
whether
he
would
heal
on
the
sabbath
day;
that
they
might
find
an
accusation
against
him.
006:008
But
he
knew
their
thoughts,
and
said
to
the
man
which
had
the
withered
hand,
Rise
up,
and
stand
forth
in
the
midst.
And
he
arose
and
stood
forth.
006:009
Then
said
Jesus
unto
them,
I
will
ask
you
one
thing;
Is
it
lawful
on
the
sabbath
days
to
do
good,
or
to
do
evil?
to
save
life,
or
to
destroy
it?
006:010
And
looking
round
about
upon
them
all,
he
said
unto
the
man,
Stretch
forth
thy
hand.
And
he
did
so:
and
his
hand
was
restored
whole
as
the
other.
006:011
And
they
were
filled
with
madness;
and
communed
one
with
another
what
they
might
do
to
Jesus.
006:012
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days,
that
he
went
out
into
a
mountain
to
pray,
and
continued
all
night
in
prayer
to
God.
006:013
And
when
it
was
day,
he
called
unto
him
his
disciples:
and
of
them
he
chose
twelve,
whom
also
he
named
apostles;
006:014
Simon,
(whom
he
also
named
Peter,)
and
Andrew
his
brother,
James
and
John,
Philip
and
Bartholomew,
006:015
Matthew
and
Thomas,
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus,
and
Simon
called
Zelotes,
006:016
And
Judas
the
brother
of
James,
and
Judas
Iscariot,
which
also
was
the
traitor.
006:017
And
he
came
down
with
them,
and
stood
in
the
plain,
and
the
company
of
his
disciples,
and
a
great
multitude
of
people
out
of
all
Judaea
and
Jerusalem,
and
from
the
sea
coast
of
Tyre
and
Sidon,
which
came
to
hear
him,
and
to
be
healed
of
their
diseases;
006:018
And
they
that
were
vexed
with
unclean
spirits:
and
they
were
healed.
006:019
And
the
whole
multitude
sought
to
touch
him:
for
there
went
virtue
out
of
him,
and
healed
them
all.
006:020
And
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
on
his
disciples,
and
said,
Blessed
be
ye
poor:
for
yours
is
the
kingdom
of
God.
006:021
Blessed
are
ye
that
hunger
now:
for
ye
shall
be
filled.
Blessed
are
ye
that
weep
now:
for
ye
shall
laugh.
006:022
Blessed
are
ye,
when
men
shall
hate
you,
and
when
they
shall
separate
you
from
their
company,
and
shall
reproach
you,
and
cast
out
your
name
as
evil,
for
the
Son
of
man's
sake.
006:023
Rejoice
ye
in
that
day,
and
leap
for
joy:
for,
behold,
your
reward
is
great
in
heaven:
for
in
the
like
manner
did
their
fathers
unto
the
prophets.
006:024
But
woe
unto
you
that
are
rich!
for
ye
have
received
your
consolation.
006:025
Woe
unto
you
that
are
full!
for
ye
shall
hunger.
Woe
unto
you
that
laugh
now!
for
ye
shall
mourn
and
weep.
006:026
Woe
unto
you,
when
all
men
shall
speak
well
of
you!
for
so
did
their
fathers
to
the
false
prophets.
006:027
But
I
say
unto
you
which
hear,
Love
your
enemies,
do
good
to
them
which
hate
you,
006:028
Bless
them
that
curse
you,
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you.
006:029
And
unto
him
that
smiteth
thee
on
the
one
cheek
offer
also
the
other;
and
him
that
taketh
away
thy
cloak
forbid
not
to
take
thy
coat
also.
006:030
Give
to
every
man
that
asketh
of
thee;
and
of
him
that
taketh
away
thy
goods
ask
them
not
again.
006:031
And
as
ye
