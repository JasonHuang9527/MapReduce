would
that
men
should
do
to
you,
do
ye
also
to
them
likewise.
006:032
For
if
ye
love
them
which
love
you,
what
thank
have
ye?
for
sinners
also
love
those
that
love
them.
006:033
And
if
ye
do
good
to
them
which
do
good
to
you,
what
thank
have
ye?
for
sinners
also
do
even
the
same.
006:034
And
if
ye
lend
to
them
of
whom
ye
hope
to
receive,
what
thank
have
ye?
for
sinners
also
lend
to
sinners,
to
receive
as
much
again.
006:035
But
love
ye
your
enemies,
and
do
good,
and
lend,
hoping
for
nothing
again;
and
your
reward
shall
be
great,
and
ye
shall
be
the
children
of
the
Highest:
for
he
is
kind
unto
the
unthankful
and
to
the
evil.
006:036
Be
ye
therefore
merciful,
as
your
Father
also
is
merciful.
006:037
Judge
not,
and
ye
shall
not
be
judged:
condemn
not,
and
ye
shall
not
be
condemned:
forgive,
and
ye
shall
be
forgiven:
006:038
Give,
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you;
good
measure,
pressed
down,
and
shaken
together,
and
running
over,
shall
men
give
into
your
bosom.
For
with
the
same
measure
that
ye
mete
withal
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again.
006:039
And
he
spake
a
parable
unto
them,
Can
the
blind
lead
the
blind?
shall
they
not
both
fall
into
the
ditch?
006:040
The
disciple
is
not
above
his
master:
but
every
one
that
is
perfect
shall
be
as
his
master.
006:041
And
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brother's
eye,
but
perceivest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye?
006:042
Either
how
canst
thou
say
to
thy
brother,
Brother,
let
me
pull
out
the
mote
that
is
in
thine
eye,
when
thou
thyself
beholdest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye?
Thou
hypocrite,
cast
out
first
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye,
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
pull
out
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brother's
eye.
006:043
For
a
good
tree
bringeth
not
forth
corrupt
fruit;
neither
doth
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
fruit.
006:044
For
every
tree
is
known
by
his
own
fruit.
For
of
thorns
men
do
not
gather
figs,
nor
of
a
bramble
bush
gather
they
grapes.
006:045
A
good
man
out
of
the
good
treasure
of
his
heart
bringeth
forth
that
which
is
good;
and
an
evil
man
out
of
the
evil
treasure
of
his
heart
bringeth
forth
that
which
is
evil:
for
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
his
mouth
speaketh.
006:046
And
why
call
ye
me,
Lord,
Lord,
and
do
not
the
things
which
I
say?
006:047
Whosoever
cometh
to
me,
and
heareth
my
sayings,
and
doeth
them,
I
will
shew
you
to
whom
he
is
like:
006:048
He
is
like
a
man
which
built
an
house,
and
digged
deep,
and
laid
the
foundation
on
a
rock:
and
when
the
flood
arose,
the
stream
beat
vehemently
upon
that
house,
and
could
not
shake
it:
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock.
006:049
But
he
that
heareth,
and
doeth
not,
is
like
a
man
that
without
a
foundation
built
an
house
upon
the
earth;
against
which
the
stream
did
beat
vehemently,
and
immediately
it
fell;
and
the
ruin
of
that
house
was
great.
007:001
Now
when
he
had
ended
all
his
sayings
in
the
audience
of
the
people,
he
entered
into
Capernaum.
007:002
And
a
certain
centurion's
servant,
who
was
dear
unto
him,
was
sick,
and
ready
to
die.
007:003
And
when
he
heard
of
Jesus,
he
sent
unto
him
the
elders
of
the
Jews,
beseeching
him
that
he
would
come
and
heal
his
servant.
007:004
And
when
they
came
to
Jesus,
they
besought
him
instantly,
saying,
That
he
was
worthy
for
whom
he
should
do
this:
007:005
For
he
loveth
our
nation,
and
he
hath
built
us
a
synagogue.
007:006
Then
Jesus
went
with
them.
And
when
he
was
now
not
far
from
the
house,
the
centurion
sent
friends
to
him,
saying
unto
him,
Lord,
trouble
not
thyself:
for
I
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
enter
under
my
roof:
007:007
Wherefore
neither
thought
I
myself
worthy
to
come
unto
thee:
but
say
in
a
word,
and
my
servant
shall
be
healed.
007:008
For
I
also
am
a
man
set
under
authority,
having
under
me
soldiers,
and
I
say
unto
one,
Go,
and
he
goeth;
and
to
another,
Come,
and
he
cometh;
and
to
my
servant,
Do
this,
and
he
doeth
it.
007:009
When
Jesus
heard
these
things,
he
marvelled
at
him,
and
turned
him
about,
and
said
unto
the
people
that
followed
him,
I
say
unto
you,
I
have
not
found
so
great
faith,
no,
not
in
Israel.
007:010
And
they
that
were
sent,
returning
to
the
house,
found
the
servant
whole
that
had
been
sick.
007:011
And
it
came
to
pass
the
day
after,
that
he
went
into
a
city
called
Nain;
and
many
of
his
disciples
went
with
him,
and
much
people.
007:012
Now
when
he
came
nigh
to
the
gate
of
the
city,
behold,
there
was
a
dead
man
carried
out,
the
only
son
of
his
mother,
and
she
was
a
widow:
and
much
people
of
the
city
was
with
her.
007:013
And
when
the
Lord
saw
her,
he
had
compassion
on
her,
and
said
unto
her,
Weep
not.
007:014
And
he
came
and
touched
the
bier:
and
they
that
bare
him
stood
still.
And
he
said,
Young
man,
I
say
unto
thee,
Arise.
007:015
And
he
that
was
dead
sat
up,
and
began
to
speak.
And
he
delivered
him
to
his
mother.
007:016
And
there
came
a
fear
on
all:
and
they
glorified
God,
saying,
That
a
great
prophet
is
risen
up
among
us;
and,
That
God
hath
visited
his
people.
007:017
And
this
rumour
of
him
went
forth
throughout
all
Judaea,
and
throughout
all
the
region
round
about.
007:018
And
the
disciples
of
John
shewed
him
of
all
these
things.
007:019
And
John
calling
unto
him
two
of
his
disciples
sent
them
to
Jesus,
saying,
Art
thou
he
that
should
come?
or
look
we
for
another?
007:020
When
the
men
were
come
unto
him,
they
said,
John
Baptist
hath
sent
us
unto
thee,
saying,
Art
thou
he
that
should
come?
or
look
we
for
another?
007:021
And
in
that
same
hour
he
cured
many
of
their
infirmities
and
plagues,
and
of
evil
spirits;
and
unto
many
that
were
blind
he
gave
sight.
007:022
Then
Jesus
answering
said
unto
them,
Go
your
way,
and
tell
John
what
things
ye
have
seen
and
heard;
how
that
the
blind
see,
the
lame
walk,
the
lepers
are
cleansed,
the
deaf
hear,
the
dead
are
raised,
to
the
poor
the
gospel
is
preached.
007:023
And
blessed
is
he,
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
me.
007:024
And
when
the
messengers
of
John
were
departed,
he
began
to
speak
unto
the
people
concerning
John,
What
went
ye
out
into
the
wilderness
for
to
see?
A
reed
shaken
with
the
wind?
007:025
But
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see?
A
man
clothed
in
soft
raiment?
Behold,
they
which
are
gorgeously
apparelled,
and
live
delicately,
are
in
kings'
courts.
007:026
But
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see?
A
prophet?
Yea,
I
say
unto
you,
and
much
more
than
a
prophet.
007:027
This
is
he,
of
whom
it
is
written,
Behold,
I
send
my
messenger
before
thy
face,
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee.
007:028
For
I
say
unto
you,
Among
those
that
are
born
of
women
there
is
not
a
greater
prophet
than
John
the
Baptist:
but
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
God
is
greater
than
he.
007:029
And
all
the
people
that
heard
him,
and
the
publicans,
justified
God,
being
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
John.
007:030
But
the
Pharisees
and
lawyers
rejected
the
counsel
of
God
against
themselves,
being
not
baptized
of
him.
007:031
And
the
Lord
said,
Whereunto
then
shall
I
liken
the
men
of
this
generation?
and
to
what
are
they
like?
007:032
They
are
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
marketplace,
and
calling
one
to
another,
and
saying,
We
have
piped
unto
you,
and
ye
have
not
danced;
we
have
mourned
to
you,
and
ye
have
not
wept.
007:033
For
John
the
Baptist
came
neither
eating
bread
nor
drinking
wine;
and
ye
say,
He
hath
a
devil.
007:034
The
Son
of
man
is
come
eating
and
drinking;
and
ye
say,
Behold
a
gluttonous
man,
and
a
winebibber,
a
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners!
007:035
But
wisdom
is
justified
of
all
her
children.
007:036
And
one
of
the
Pharisees
desired
him
that
he
would
eat
with
him.
And
he
went
into
the
Pharisee's
house,
and
sat
down
to
meat.
007:037
And,
behold,
a
woman
in
the
city,
which
was
a
sinner,
when
she
knew
that
Jesus
sat
at
meat
in
the
Pharisee's
house,
brought
an
alabaster
box
of
ointment,
007:038
And
stood
at
his
feet
behind
him
weeping,
and
began
to
wash
his
feet
with
tears,
and
did
wipe
them
with
the
hairs
of
her
head,
and
kissed
his
feet,
and
anointed
them
with
the
ointment.
007:039
Now
when
the
Pharisee
which
had
bidden
him
saw
it,
he
spake
within
himself,
saying,
This
man,
if
he
were
a
prophet,
would
have
known
who
and
what
manner
of
woman
this
is
that
toucheth
him:
for
she
is
a
sinner.
007:040
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
him,
Simon,
I
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
thee.
And
he
saith,
Master,
say
on.
007:041
There
was
a
certain
creditor
which
had
two
debtors:
the
one
owed
five
hundred
pence,
and
the
other
fifty.
007:042
And
when
they
had
nothing
to
pay,
he
frankly
forgave
them
both.
Tell
me
therefore,
which
of
them
will
love
him
most?
007:043
Simon
answered
and
said,
I
suppose
that
he,
to
whom
he
forgave
most.
And
he
said
unto
him,
Thou
hast
rightly
judged.
007:044
And
he
turned
to
the
woman,
and
said
unto
Simon,
Seest
thou
this
woman?
I
entered
into
thine
house,
thou
gavest
me
no
water
for
my
feet:
but
she
hath
washed
my
feet
with
tears,
and
wiped
them
with
the
hairs
of
her
head.
007:045
Thou
gavest
me
no
kiss:
but
this
woman
since
the
time
I
came
in
hath
not
ceased
to
kiss
my
feet.
007:046
My
head
with
oil
thou
didst
not
anoint:
but
this
woman
hath
anointed
my
feet
with
ointment.
007:047
Wherefore
I
say
unto
thee,
Her
sins,
which
are
many,
are
forgiven;
for
she
loved
much:
but
to
whom
little
is
forgiven,
the
same
loveth
little.
007:048
And
he
said
unto
her,
Thy
sins
are
forgiven.
007:049
And
they
that
sat
at
meat
with
him
began
to
say
within
themselves,
Who
is
this
that
forgiveth
sins
also?
007:050
And
he
said
to
the
woman,
Thy
faith
hath
saved
thee;
go
in
peace.
008:001
And
it
came
to
pass
afterward,
that
he
went
throughout
every
city
and
village,
preaching
and
shewing
the
glad
tidings
of
the
kingdom
of
God:
and
the
twelve
were
with
him,
008:002
And
certain
women,
which
had
been
healed
of
evil
spirits
and
infirmities,
Mary
called
Magdalene,
out
of
whom
went
seven
devils,
008:003
And
Joanna
the
wife
of
Chuza
Herod's
steward,
and
Susanna,
and
many
others,
which
ministered
unto
him
of
their
substance.
008:004
And
when
much
people
were
gathered
together,
and
were
come
to
him
out
of
every
city,
he
spake
by
a
parable:
008:005
A
sower
went
out
to
sow
his
seed:
and
as
he
sowed,
some
fell
by
the
way
side;
and
it
was
trodden
down,
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
devoured
it.
008:006
And
some
fell
upon
a
rock;
and
as
soon
as
it
was
sprung
up,
it
withered
away,
because
it
lacked
moisture.
008:007
And
some
fell
among
thorns;
and
the
thorns
sprang
up
with
it,
and
choked
it.
008:008
And
other
fell
on
good
ground,
and
sprang
up,
and
bare
fruit
an
hundredfold.
And
when
he
had
said
these
things,
he
cried,
He
that
hath
ears
to
hear,
let
him
hear.
008:009
And
his
disciples
asked
him,
saying,
What
might
this
parable
be?
008:010
And
he
said,
Unto
you
it
is
given
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
God:
but
to
others
in
parables;
that
seeing
they
might
not
see,
and
hearing
they
might
not
understand.
008:011
Now
the
parable
is
this:
The
seed
is
the
word
of
God.
008:012
Those
by
the
way
side
are
they
that
hear;
then
cometh
the
devil,
and
taketh
away
the
word
out
of
their
hearts,
lest
they
should
believe
and
be
saved.
008:013
They
on
the
rock
are
they,
which,
when
they
hear,
receive
the
word
with
joy;
and
these
have
no
root,
which
for
a
while
believe,
and
in
time
of
temptation
fall
away.
008:014
And
that
which
fell
among
thorns
are
they,
which,
when
they
have
heard,
go
forth,
and
are
choked
with
cares
and
riches
and
pleasures
of
this
life,
and
bring
no
fruit
to
perfection.
008:015
But
that
on
the
good
ground
are
they,
which
in
an
honest
and
good
heart,
having
heard
the
word,
keep
it,
and
bring
forth
fruit
with
patience.
008:016
No
man,
when
he
hath
lighted
a
candle,
covereth
it
with
a
vessel,
or
putteth
it
under
a
bed;
but
setteth
it
on
a
candlestick,
that
they
which
enter
in
may
see
the
light.
008:017
For
nothing
is
secret,
that
shall
not
be
made
manifest;
neither
any
thing
hid,
that
shall
not
be
known
and
come
abroad.
008:018
Take
heed
therefore
how
ye
hear:
for
whosoever
hath,
to
him
shall
be
given;
and
whosoever
hath
not,
from
him
shall
be
taken
even
that
which
he
seemeth
to
have.
008:019
Then
came
to
him
his
mother
and
his
brethren,
and
could
not
come
at
him
for
the
press.
008:020
And
it
was
told
him
by
certain
which
said,
Thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without,
desiring
to
see
thee.
008:021
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
them,
My
mother
and
my
brethren
are
these
which
hear
the
word
of
God,
and
do
it.
008:022
Now
it
came
to
pass
on
a
certain
day,
that
he
went
into
a
ship
with
his
disciples:
and
he
said
unto
them,
Let
us
go
over
unto
the
other
side
of
the
lake.
And
they
launched
forth.
008:023
But
as
they
sailed
he
fell
asleep:
and
there
came
down
a
storm
of
wind
on
the
lake;
and
they
were
filled
with
water,
and
were
in
jeopardy.
008:024
And
they
came
to
him,
and
awoke
him,
saying,
Master,
master,
we
perish.
Then
he
arose,
and
rebuked
the
wind
and
the
raging
of
the
water:
and
they
ceased,
and
there
was
a
calm.
008:025
And
he
said
unto
them,
Where
is
your
faith?
And
they
being
afraid
wondered,
saying
one
to
another,
What
manner
of
man
is
this!
for
he
commandeth
even
the
winds
and
water,
and
they
obey
him.
008:026
And
they
arrived
at
the
country
of
the
Gadarenes,
which
is
over
against
Galilee.
008:027
And
when
he
went
forth
to
land,
there
met
him
out
of
the
city
a
certain
man,
which
had
devils
long
time,
and
ware
no
clothes,
neither
abode
in
any
house,
but
in
the
tombs.
008:028
When
he
saw
Jesus,
he
cried
out,
and
fell
down
before
him,
and
with
a
loud
voice
said,
What
have
I
to
do
with
thee,
Jesus,
thou
Son
of
God
most
high?
I
beseech
thee,
torment
me
not.
008:029
(For
he
had
commanded
the
unclean
spirit
to
come
out
of
the
man.
For
oftentimes
it
had
caught
him:
and
he
was
kept
bound
with
chains
and
in
fetters;
and
he
brake
the
bands,
and
was
driven
of
the
devil
into
the
wilderness.)
008:030
And
Jesus
asked
him,
saying,
What
is
thy
name?
And
he
said,
Legion:
because
many
devils
were
entered
into
him.
008:031
And
they
besought
him
that
he
would
not
command
them
to
go
out
into
the
deep.
008:032
And
there
was
there
an
herd
of
many
swine
feeding
on
the
mountain:
and
they
besought
him
that
he
would
suffer
them
to
enter
into
them.
And
he
suffered
them.
008:033
Then
went
the
devils
out
of
the
man,
and
entered
into
the
swine:
and
the
herd
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
lake,
and
were
choked.
008:034
When
they
that
fed
them
saw
what
was
done,
they
fled,
and
went
and
told
it
in
the
city
and
in
the
country.
008:035
Then
they
went
out
to
see
what
was
done;
and
came
to
Jesus,
and
found
the
man,
out
of
whom
the
devils
were
departed,
sitting
at
the
feet
of
Jesus,
clothed,
and
in
his
right
mind:
and
they
were
afraid.
008:036
They
also
which
saw
it
told
them
by
what
means
he
that
was
possessed
of
the
devils
was
healed.
008:037
Then
the
whole
multitude
of
the
country
of
the
Gadarenes
round
about
besought
him
to
depart
from
them;
for
they
were
taken
with
great
fear:
and
he
went
up
into
the
ship,
and
returned
back
again.
008:038
Now
the
man
out
of
whom
the
devils
were
departed
besought
him
that
he
might
be
with
him:
but
Jesus
sent
him
away,
saying,
008:039
Return
to
thine
own
house,
and
shew
how
great
things
God
hath
done
unto
thee.
And
he
went
his
way,
and
published
throughout
the
whole
city
how
great
things
Jesus
had
done
unto
him.
008:040
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
Jesus
was
returned,
the
people
gladly
received
him:
for
they
were
all
waiting
for
him.
008:041
And,
behold,
there
came
a
man
named
Jairus,
and
he
was
a
ruler
of
the
synagogue:
and
he
fell
down
at
Jesus'
feet,
and
besought
him
that
he
would
come
into
his
house:
008:042
For
he
had
one
only
daughter,
about
twelve
years
of
age,
and
she
lay
a
dying.
But
as
he
went
the
people
thronged
him.
008:043
And
a
woman
having
an
issue
of
blood
twelve
years,
which
had
spent
all
her
living
upon
physicians,
neither
could
be
healed
of
any,
008:044
Came
behind
him,
and
touched
the
border
of
his
garment:
and
immediately
her
issue
of
blood
stanched.
008:045
And
Jesus
said,
Who
touched
me?
When
all
denied,
Peter
and
they
that
were
with
him
said,
Master,
the
multitude
throng
thee
and
press
thee,
and
sayest
thou,
Who
touched
me?
008:046
And
Jesus
said,
Somebody
hath
touched
me:
for
I
perceive
that
virtue
is
gone
out
of
me.
008:047
And
when
the
woman
saw
that
she
was
not
hid,
she
came
trembling,
and
falling
down
before
him,
she
declared
unto
him
before
all
the
people
for
what
cause
she
had
touched
him,
and
how
she
was
healed
immediately.
008:048
And
he
said
unto
her,
Daughter,
be
of
good
comfort:
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole;
go
in
peace.
008:049
While
he
yet
spake,
there
cometh
one
from
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue's
house,
saying
to
him,
Thy
daughter
is
dead;
trouble
not
the
Master.
008:050
But
when
Jesus
heard
it,
he
answered
him,
saying,
Fear
not:
believe
only,
and
she
shall
be
made
whole.
008:051
And
when
he
came
into
the
house,
he
suffered
no
man
to
go
in,
save
Peter,
and
James,
and
John,
and
the
father
and
the
mother
of
the
maiden.
008:052
And
all
wept,
and
bewailed
her:
but
he
said,
Weep
not;
she
is
not
dead,
but
sleepeth.
008:053
And
they
laughed
him
to
scorn,
knowing
that
she
was
dead.
008:054
And
he
put
them
all
out,
and
took
her
by
the
hand,
and
called,
saying,
Maid,
arise.
008:055
And
her
spirit
came
again,
and
she
arose
straightway:
and
he
commanded
to
give
her
meat.
008:056
And
her
parents
were
astonished:
but
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
what
was
done.
009:001
Then
he
called
his
twelve
disciples
together,
and
gave
them
power
and
authority
over
all
devils,
and
to
cure
diseases.
009:002
And
he
sent
them
to
preach
the
kingdom
of
God,
and
to
heal
the
sick.
009:003
And
he
said
unto
them,
Take
nothing
for
your
journey,
neither
staves,
nor
scrip,
neither
bread,
neither
money;
neither
have
two
coats
apiece.
009:004
And
whatsoever
house
ye
enter
into,
there
abide,
and
thence
depart.
009:005
And
whosoever
will
not
receive
you,
when
ye
go
out
of
that
city,
shake
off
the
very
dust
from
your
feet
for
a
testimony
against
them.
009:006
And
they
departed,
and
went
through
the
towns,
preaching
the
gospel,
and
healing
every
where.
009:007
Now
Herod
the
tetrarch
heard
of
all
that
was
done
by
him:
and
he
was
perplexed,
because
that
it
was
said
of
some,
that
John
was
risen
from
the
dead;
009:008
And
of
some,
that
Elias
had
appeared;
and
of
others,
that
one
of
the
old
prophets
was
risen
again.
009:009
And
Herod
said,
John
have
I
beheaded:
but
who
is
this,
of
whom
I
hear
such
things?
And
he
desired
to
see
him.
009:010
And
the
apostles,
when
they
were
returned,
told
him
all
that
they
had
done.
And
he
took
them,
and
went
aside
privately
into
a
desert
place
belonging
to
the
city
called
Bethsaida.
009:011
And
the
people,
when
they
knew
it,
followed
him:
and
he
received
them,
and
spake
unto
them
of
the
kingdom
of
God,
and
healed
them
that
had
need
of
healing.
009:012
And
when
the
day
began
to
wear
away,
then
came
the
twelve,
and
said
unto
him,
Send
the
multitude
away,
that
they
may
go
into
the
towns
and
country
round
about,
and
lodge,
and
get
victuals:
for
we
are
here
in
a
desert
place.
009:013
But
he
said
unto
them,
Give
ye
them
to
eat.
And
they
said,
We
have
no
more
but
five
loaves
and
two
fishes;
except
we
should
go
and
buy
meat
for
all
this
people.
009:014
For
they
were
about
five
thousand
men.
And
he
said
to
his
disciples,
Make
them
sit
down
by
fifties
in
a
company.
009:015
And
they
did
so,
and
made
them
all
sit
down.
009:016
Then
he
took
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes,
and
looking
up
to
heaven,
he
blessed
them,
and
brake,
and
gave
to
the
disciples
to
set
before
the
multitude.
009:017
And
they
did
eat,
and
were
all
filled:
and
there
was
taken
up
of
fragments
that
remained
to
them
twelve
baskets.
009:018
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
was
alone
praying,
his
disciples
were
with
him:
and
he
asked
them,
saying,
Whom
say
the
people
that
I
am?
009:019
They
answering
said,
John
the
Baptist;
but
some
say,
Elias;
and
others
say,
that
one
of
the
old
prophets
is
risen
again.
009:020
He
said
unto
them,
But
whom
say
ye
that
I
am?
Peter
answering
said,
The
Christ
of
God.
009:021
And
he
straitly
charged
them,
and
commanded
them
to
tell
no
man
that
thing;
009:022
Saying,
The
Son
of
man
must
suffer
many
things,
and
be
rejected
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes,
and
be
slain,
and
be
raised
the
third
day.
009:023
And
he
said
to
them
all,
If
any
man
will
come
after
me,
let
him
deny
himself,
and
take
up
his
cross
daily,
and
follow
me.
009:024
For
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it:
but
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
sake,
the
same
shall
save
it.
009:025
For
what
is
a
man
advantaged,
if
he
gain
the
whole
world,
and
lose
himself,
or
be
cast
away?
009:026
For
whosoever
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words,
of
him
shall
the
Son
of
man
be
ashamed,
when
he
shall
come
in
his
own
glory,
and
in
his
Father's,
and
of
the
holy
angels.
009:027
But
I
tell
you
of
a
truth,
there
be
some
standing
here,
which
shall
not
taste
of
death,
till
they
see
the
kingdom
of
God.
009:028
And
it
came
to
pass
about
an
eight
days
after
these
sayings,
he
took
Peter
and
John
and
James,
and
went
up
into
a
mountain
to
pray.
009:029
And
as
he
prayed,
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
was
altered,
and
his
raiment
was
white
and
glistering.
009:030
And,
behold,
there
talked
with
him
two
men,
which
were
Moses
and
Elias:
009:031
Who
appeared
in
glory,
and
spake
of
his
decease
which
he
should
accomplish
at
Jerusalem.
009:032
But
Peter
and
they
that
were
with
him
were
heavy
with
sleep:
and
when
they
were
awake,
they
saw
his
glory,
and
the
two
men
that
stood
with
him.
009:033
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
departed
from
him,
Peter
said
unto
Jesus,
Master,
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here:
and
let
us
make
