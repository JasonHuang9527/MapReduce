three
tabernacles;
one
for
thee,
and
one
for
Moses,
and
one
for
Elias:
not
knowing
what
he
said.
009:034
While
he
thus
spake,
there
came
a
cloud,
and
overshadowed
them:
and
they
feared
as
they
entered
into
the
cloud.
009:035
And
there
came
a
voice
out
of
the
cloud,
saying,
This
is
my
beloved
Son:
hear
him.
009:036
And
when
the
voice
was
past,
Jesus
was
found
alone.
And
they
kept
it
close,
and
told
no
man
in
those
days
any
of
those
things
which
they
had
seen.
009:037
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
on
the
next
day,
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
hill,
much
people
met
him.
009:038
And,
behold,
a
man
of
the
company
cried
out,
saying,
Master,
I
beseech
thee,
look
upon
my
son:
for
he
is
mine
only
child.
009:039
And,
lo,
a
spirit
taketh
him,
and
he
suddenly
crieth
out;
and
it
teareth
him
that
he
foameth
again,
and
bruising
him
hardly
departeth
from
him.
009:040
And
I
besought
thy
disciples
to
cast
him
out;
and
they
could
not.
009:041
And
Jesus
answering
said,
O
faithless
and
perverse
generation,
how
long
shall
I
be
with
you,
and
suffer
you?
Bring
thy
son
hither.
009:042
And
as
he
was
yet
a
coming,
the
devil
threw
him
down,
and
tare
him.
And
Jesus
rebuked
the
unclean
spirit,
and
healed
the
child,
and
delivered
him
again
to
his
father.
009:043
And
they
were
all
amazed
at
the
mighty
power
of
God.
But
while
they
wondered
every
one
at
all
things
which
Jesus
did,
he
said
unto
his
disciples,
009:044
Let
these
sayings
sink
down
into
your
ears:
for
the
Son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
men.
009:045
But
they
understood
not
this
saying,
and
it
was
hid
from
them,
that
they
perceived
it
not:
and
they
feared
to
ask
him
of
that
saying.
009:046
Then
there
arose
a
reasoning
among
them,
which
of
them
should
be
greatest.
009:047
And
Jesus,
perceiving
the
thought
of
their
heart,
took
a
child,
and
set
him
by
him,
009:048
And
said
unto
them,
Whosoever
shall
receive
this
child
in
my
name
receiveth
me:
and
whosoever
shall
receive
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
me:
for
he
that
is
least
among
you
all,
the
same
shall
be
great.
009:049
And
John
answered
and
said,
Master,
we
saw
one
casting
out
devils
in
thy
name;
and
we
forbad
him,
because
he
followeth
not
with
us.
009:050
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Forbid
him
not:
for
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
for
us.
009:051
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
time
was
come
that
he
should
be
received
up,
he
stedfastly
set
his
face
to
go
to
Jerusalem,
009:052
And
sent
messengers
before
his
face:
and
they
went,
and
entered
into
a
village
of
the
Samaritans,
to
make
ready
for
him.
009:053
And
they
did
not
receive
him,
because
his
face
was
as
though
he
would
go
to
Jerusalem.
009:054
And
when
his
disciples
James
and
John
saw
this,
they
said,
Lord,
wilt
thou
that
we
command
fire
to
come
down
from
heaven,
and
consume
them,
even
as
Elias
did?
009:055
But
he
turned,
and
rebuked
them,
and
said,
Ye
know
not
what
manner
of
spirit
ye
are
of.
009:056
For
the
Son
of
man
is
not
come
to
destroy
men's
lives,
but
to
save
them.
And
they
went
to
another
village.
009:057
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
as
they
went
in
the
way,
a
certain
man
said
unto
him,
Lord,
I
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest.
009:058
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Foxes
have
holes,
and
birds
of
the
air
have
nests;
but
the
Son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head.
009:059
And
he
said
unto
another,
Follow
me.
But
he
said,
Lord,
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
father.
009:060
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Let
the
dead
bury
their
dead:
but
go
thou
and
preach
the
kingdom
of
God.
009:061
And
another
also
said,
Lord,
I
will
follow
thee;
but
let
me
first
go
bid
them
farewell,
which
are
at
home
at
my
house.
009:062
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
No
man,
having
put
his
hand
to
the
plough,
and
looking
back,
is
fit
for
the
kingdom
of
God.
010:001
After
these
things
the
LORD
appointed
other
seventy
also,
and
sent
them
two
and
two
before
his
face
into
every
city
and
place,
whither
he
himself
would
come.
010:002
Therefore
said
he
unto
them,
The
harvest
truly
is
great,
but
the
labourers
are
few:
pray
ye
therefore
the
Lord
of
the
harvest,
that
he
would
send
forth
labourers
into
his
harvest.
010:003
Go
your
ways:
behold,
I
send
you
forth
as
lambs
among
wolves.
010:004
Carry
neither
purse,
nor
scrip,
nor
shoes:
and
salute
no
man
by
the
way.
010:005
And
into
whatsoever
house
ye
enter,
first
say,
Peace
be
to
this
house.
010:006
And
if
the
son
of
peace
be
there,
your
peace
shall
rest
upon
it:
if
not,
it
shall
turn
to
you
again.
010:007
And
in
the
same
house
remain,
eating
and
drinking
such
things
as
they
give:
for
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire.
Go
not
from
house
to
house.
010:008
And
into
whatsoever
city
ye
enter,
and
they
receive
you,
eat
such
things
as
are
set
before
you:
010:009
And
heal
the
sick
that
are
therein,
and
say
unto
them,
The
kingdom
of
God
is
come
nigh
unto
you.
010:010
But
into
whatsoever
city
ye
enter,
and
they
receive
you
not,
go
your
ways
out
into
the
streets
of
the
same,
and
say,
010:011
Even
the
very
dust
of
your
city,
which
cleaveth
on
us,
we
do
wipe
off
against
you:
notwithstanding
be
ye
sure
of
this,
that
the
kingdom
of
God
is
come
nigh
unto
you.
010:012
But
I
say
unto
you,
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
in
that
day
for
Sodom,
than
for
that
city.
010:013
Woe
unto
thee,
Chorazin!
woe
unto
thee,
Bethsaida!
for
if
the
mighty
works
had
been
done
in
Tyre
and
Sidon,
which
have
been
done
in
you,
they
had
a
great
while
ago
repented,
sitting
in
sackcloth
and
ashes.
010:014
But
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
at
the
judgment,
than
for
you.
010:015
And
thou,
Capernaum,
which
art
exalted
to
heaven,
shalt
be
thrust
down
to
hell.
010:016
He
that
heareth
you
heareth
me;
and
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
me;
and
he
that
despiseth
me
despiseth
him
that
sent
me.
010:017
And
the
seventy
returned
again
with
joy,
saying,
Lord,
even
the
devils
are
subject
unto
us
through
thy
name.
010:018
And
he
said
unto
them,
I
beheld
Satan
as
lightning
fall
from
heaven.
010:019
Behold,
I
give
unto
you
power
to
tread
on
serpents
and
scorpions,
and
over
all
the
power
of
the
enemy:
and
nothing
shall
by
any
means
hurt
you.
010:020
Notwithstanding
in
this
rejoice
not,
that
the
spirits
are
subject
unto
you;
but
rather
rejoice,
because
your
names
are
written
in
heaven.
010:021
In
that
hour
Jesus
rejoiced
in
spirit,
and
said,
I
thank
thee,
O
Father,
Lord
of
heaven
and
earth,
that
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent,
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes:
even
so,
Father;
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight.
010:022
All
things
are
delivered
to
me
of
my
Father:
and
no
man
knoweth
who
the
Son
is,
but
the
Father;
and
who
the
Father
is,
but
the
Son,
and
he
to
whom
the
Son
will
reveal
him.
010:023
And
he
turned
him
unto
his
disciples,
and
said
privately,
Blessed
are
the
eyes
which
see
the
things
that
ye
see:
010:024
For
I
tell
you,
that
many
prophets
and
kings
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
see,
and
have
not
seen
them;
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
hear,
and
have
not
heard
them.
010:025
And,
behold,
a
certain
lawyer
stood
up,
and
tempted
him,
saying,
Master,
what
shall
I
do
to
inherit
eternal
life?
010:026
He
said
unto
him,
What
is
written
in
the
law?
how
readest
thou?
010:027
And
he
answering
said,
Thou
shalt
love
the
Lord
thy
God
with
all
thy
heart,
and
with
all
thy
soul,
and
with
all
thy
strength,
and
with
all
thy
mind;
and
thy
neighbour
as
thyself.
010:028
And
he
said
unto
him,
Thou
hast
answered
right:
this
do,
and
thou
shalt
live.
010:029
But
he,
willing
to
justify
himself,
said
unto
Jesus,
And
who
is
my
neighbour?
010:030
And
Jesus
answering
said,
A
certain
man
went
down
from
Jerusalem
to
Jericho,
and
fell
among
thieves,
which
stripped
him
of
his
raiment,
and
wounded
him,
and
departed,
leaving
him
half
dead.
010:031
And
by
chance
there
came
down
a
certain
priest
that
way:
and
when
he
saw
him,
he
passed
by
on
the
other
side.
010:032
And
likewise
a
Levite,
when
he
was
at
the
place,
came
and
looked
on
him,
and
passed
by
on
the
other
side.
010:033
But
a
certain
Samaritan,
as
he
journeyed,
came
where
he
was:
and
when
he
saw
him,
he
had
compassion
on
him,
010:034
And
went
to
him,
and
bound
up
his
wounds,
pouring
in
oil
and
wine,
and
set
him
on
his
own
beast,
and
brought
him
to
an
inn,
and
took
care
of
him.
010:035
And
on
the
morrow
when
he
departed,
he
took
out
two
pence,
and
gave
them
to
the
host,
and
said
unto
him,
Take
care
of
him;
and
whatsoever
thou
spendest
more,
when
I
come
again,
I
will
repay
thee.
010:036
Which
now
of
these
three,
thinkest
thou,
was
neighbour
unto
him
that
fell
among
the
thieves?
010:037
And
he
said,
He
that
shewed
mercy
on
him.
Then
said
Jesus
unto
him,
Go,
and
do
thou
likewise.
010:038
Now
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
went,
that
he
entered
into
a
certain
village:
and
a
certain
woman
named
Martha
received
him
into
her
house.
010:039
And
she
had
a
sister
called
Mary,
which
also
sat
at
Jesus'
feet,
and
heard
his
word.
010:040
But
Martha
was
cumbered
about
much
serving,
and
came
to
him,
and
said,
Lord,
dost
thou
not
care
that
my
sister
hath
left
me
to
serve
alone?
bid
her
therefore
that
she
help
me.
010:041
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her,
Martha,
Martha,
thou
art
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things:
010:042
But
one
thing
is
needful:
and
Mary
hath
chosen
that
good
part,
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
her.
011:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
as
he
was
praying
in
a
certain
place,
when
he
ceased,
one
of
his
disciples
said
unto
him,
Lord,
teach
us
to
pray,
as
John
also
taught
his
disciples.
011:002
And
he
said
unto
them,
When
ye
pray,
say,
Our
Father
which
art
in
heaven,
Hallowed
be
thy
name.
Thy
kingdom
come.
Thy
will
be
done,
as
in
heaven,
so
in
earth.
011:003
Give
us
day
by
day
our
daily
bread.
011:004
And
forgive
us
our
sins;
for
we
also
forgive
every
one
that
is
indebted
to
us.
And
lead
us
not
into
temptation;
but
deliver
us
from
evil.
011:005
And
he
said
unto
them,
Which
of
you
shall
have
a
friend,
and
shall
go
unto
him
at
midnight,
and
say
unto
him,
Friend,
lend
me
three
loaves;
011:006
For
a
friend
of
mine
in
his
journey
is
come
to
me,
and
I
have
nothing
to
set
before
him?
011:007
And
he
from
within
shall
answer
and
say,
Trouble
me
not:
the
door
is
now
shut,
and
my
children
are
with
me
in
bed;
I
cannot
rise
and
give
thee.
011:008
I
say
unto
you,
Though
he
will
not
rise
and
give
him,
because
he
is
his
friend,
yet
because
of
his
importunity
he
will
rise
and
give
him
as
many
as
he
needeth.
011:009
And
I
say
unto
you,
Ask,
and
it
shall
be
given
you;
seek,
and
ye
shall
find;
knock,
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you.
011:010
For
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth;
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth;
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened.
011:011
If
a
son
shall
ask
bread
of
any
of
you
that
is
a
father,
will
he
give
him
a
stone?
or
if
he
ask
a
fish,
will
he
for
a
fish
give
him
a
serpent?
011:012
Or
if
he
shall
ask
an
egg,
will
he
offer
him
a
scorpion?
011:013
If
ye
then,
being
evil,
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children:
how
much
more
shall
your
heavenly
Father
give
the
Holy
Spirit
to
them
that
ask
him?
011:014
And
he
was
casting
out
a
devil,
and
it
was
dumb.
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
devil
was
gone
out,
the
dumb
spake;
and
the
people
wondered.
011:015
But
some
of
them
said,
He
casteth
out
devils
through
Beelzebub
the
chief
of
the
devils.
011:016
And
others,
tempting
him,
sought
of
him
a
sign
from
heaven.
011:017
But
he,
knowing
their
thoughts,
said
unto
them,
Every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
is
brought
to
desolation;
and
a
house
divided
against
a
house
falleth.
011:018
If
Satan
also
be
divided
against
himself,
how
shall
his
kingdom
stand?
because
ye
say
that
I
cast
out
devils
through
Beelzebub.
011:019
And
if
I
by
Beelzebub
cast
out
devils,
by
whom
do
your
sons
cast
them
out?
therefore
shall
they
be
your
judges.
011:020
But
if
I
with
the
finger
of
God
cast
out
devils,
no
doubt
the
kingdom
of
God
is
come
upon
you.
011:021
When
a
strong
man
armed
keepeth
his
palace,
his
goods
are
in
peace:
011:022
But
when
a
stronger
than
he
shall
come
upon
him,
and
overcome
him,
he
taketh
from
him
all
his
armour
wherein
he
trusted,
and
divideth
his
spoils.
011:023
He
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
me:
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
scattereth.
011:024
When
the
unclean
spirit
is
gone
out
of
a
man,
he
walketh
through
dry
places,
seeking
rest;
and
finding
none,
he
saith,
I
will
return
unto
my
house
whence
I
came
out.
011:025
And
when
he
cometh,
he
findeth
it
swept
and
garnished.
011:026
Then
goeth
he,
and
taketh
to
him
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
himself;
and
they
enter
in,
and
dwell
there:
and
the
last
state
of
that
man
is
worse
than
the
first.
011:027
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
spake
these
things,
a
certain
woman
of
the
company
lifted
up
her
voice,
and
said
unto
him,
Blessed
is
the
womb
that
bare
thee,
and
the
paps
which
thou
hast
sucked.
011:028
But
he
said,
Yea
rather,
blessed
are
they
that
hear
the
word
of
God,
and
keep
it.
011:029
And
when
the
people
were
gathered
thick
together,
he
began
to
say,
This
is
an
evil
generation:
they
seek
a
sign;
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
it,
but
the
sign
of
Jonas
the
prophet.
011:030
For
as
Jonas
was
a
sign
unto
the
Ninevites,
so
shall
also
the
Son
of
man
be
to
this
generation.
011:031
The
queen
of
the
south
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
the
men
of
this
generation,
and
condemn
them:
for
she
came
from
the
utmost
parts
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
Solomon;
and,
behold,
a
greater
than
Solomon
is
here.
011:032
The
men
of
Nineve
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
generation,
and
shall
condemn
it:
for
they
repented
at
the
preaching
of
Jonas;
and,
behold,
a
greater
than
Jonas
is
here.
011:033
No
man,
when
he
hath
lighted
a
candle,
putteth
it
in
a
secret
place,
neither
under
a
bushel,
but
on
a
candlestick,
that
they
which
come
in
may
see
the
light.
011:034
The
light
of
the
body
is
the
eye:
therefore
when
thine
eye
is
single,
thy
whole
body
also
is
full
of
light;
but
when
thine
eye
is
evil,
thy
body
also
is
full
of
darkness.
011:035
Take
heed
therefore
that
the
light
which
is
in
thee
be
not
darkness.
011:036
If
thy
whole
body
therefore
be
full
of
light,
having
no
part
dark,
the
whole
shall
be
full
of
light,
as
when
the
bright
shining
of
a
candle
doth
give
thee
light.
011:037
And
as
he
spake,
a
certain
Pharisee
besought
him
to
dine
with
him:
and
he
went
in,
and
sat
down
to
meat.
011:038
And
when
the
Pharisee
saw
it,
he
marvelled
that
he
had
not
first
washed
before
dinner.
011:039
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him,
Now
do
ye
Pharisees
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
the
platter;
but
your
inward
part
is
full
of
ravening
and
wickedness.
011:040
Ye
fools,
did
not
he
that
made
that
which
is
without
make
that
which
is
within
also?
011:041
But
rather
give
alms
of
such
things
as
ye
have;
and,
behold,
all
things
are
clean
unto
you.
011:042
But
woe
unto
you,
Pharisees!
for
ye
tithe
mint
and
rue
and
all
manner
of
herbs,
and
pass
over
judgment
and
the
love
of
God:
these
ought
ye
to
have
done,
and
not
to
leave
the
other
undone.
011:043
Woe
unto
you,
Pharisees!
for
ye
love
the
uppermost
seats
in
the
synagogues,
and
greetings
in
the
markets.
011:044
Woe
unto
you,
scribes
and
Pharisees,
hypocrites!
for
ye
are
as
graves
which
appear
not,
and
the
men
that
walk
over
them
are
not
aware
of
them.
011:045
Then
answered
one
of
the
lawyers,
and
said
unto
him,
Master,
thus
saying
thou
reproachest
us
also.
011:046
And
he
said,
Woe
unto
you
also,
ye
lawyers!
for
ye
lade
men
with
burdens
grievous
to
be
borne,
and
ye
yourselves
touch
not
the
burdens
with
one
of
your
fingers.
011:047
Woe
unto
you!
for
ye
build
the
sepulchres
of
the
prophets,
and
your
fathers
killed
them.
011:048
Truly
ye
bear
witness
that
ye
allow
the
deeds
of
your
fathers:
for
they
indeed
killed
them,
and
ye
build
their
sepulchres.
011:049
Therefore
also
said
the
wisdom
of
God,
I
will
send
them
prophets
and
apostles,
and
some
of
them
they
shall
slay
and
persecute:
011:050
That
the
blood
of
all
the
prophets,
which
was
shed
from
the
foundation
of
the
world,
may
be
required
of
this
generation;
011:051
From
the
blood
of
Abel
unto
the
blood
of
Zacharias
which
perished
between
the
altar
and
the
temple:
verily
I
say
unto
you,
It
shall
be
required
of
this
generation.
011:052
Woe
unto
you,
lawyers!
for
ye
have
taken
away
the
key
of
knowledge:
ye
entered
not
in
yourselves,
and
them
that
were
entering
in
ye
hindered.
011:053
And
as
he
said
these
things
unto
them,
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
began
to
urge
him
vehemently,
and
to
provoke
him
to
speak
of
many
things:
011:054
Laying
wait
for
him,
and
seeking
to
catch
something
out
of
his
mouth,
that
they
might
accuse
him.
012:001
In
the
mean
time,
when
there
were
gathered
together
an
innumerable
multitude
of
people,
insomuch
that
they
trode
one
upon
another,
he
began
to
say
unto
his
disciples
first
of
all,
Beware
ye
of
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees,
which
is
hypocrisy.
012:002
For
there
is
nothing
covered,
that
shall
not
be
revealed;
neither
hid,
that
shall
not
be
known.
012:003
Therefore
whatsoever
ye
have
spoken
in
darkness
shall
be
heard
in
the
light;
and
that
which
ye
have
spoken
in
the
ear
in
closets
shall
be
proclaimed
upon
the
housetops.
012:004
And
I
say
unto
you
my
friends,
Be
not
afraid
of
them
that
kill
the
body,
and
after
that
have
no
more
that
they
can
do.
012:005
But
I
will
forewarn
you
whom
ye
shall
fear:
Fear
him,
which
after
he
hath
killed
hath
power
to
cast
into
hell;
yea,
I
say
unto
you,
Fear
him.
012:006
Are
not
five
sparrows
sold
for
two
farthings,
and
not
one
of
them
is
forgotten
before
God?
012:007
But
even
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered.
Fear
not
therefore:
ye
are
of
more
value
than
many
sparrows.
012:008
Also
I
say
unto
you,
Whosoever
shall
confess
me
before
men,
him
shall
the
Son
of
man
also
confess
before
the
angels
of
God:
012:009
But
he
that
denieth
me
before
men
shall
be
denied
before
the
angels
of
God.
012:010
And
whosoever
shall
speak
a
word
against
the
Son
of
man,
it
shall
be
forgiven
him:
but
unto
him
that
blasphemeth
against
the
Holy
Ghost
it
shall
not
be
forgiven.
012:011
And
when
they
bring
you
unto
the
synagogues,
and
unto
magistrates,
and
powers,
take
ye
no
thought
how
or
what
thing
ye
shall
answer,
or
what
ye
shall
say:
012:012
For
the
Holy
Ghost
shall
teach
you
in
the
same
hour
what
ye
ought
to
say.
012:013
And
one
of
the
company
said
unto
him,
Master,
speak
to
my
brother,
that
he
divide
the
inheritance
with
me.
012:014
And
he
said
unto
him,
Man,
who
made
me
a
judge
or
a
divider
over
you?
012:015
And
he
said
unto
them,
Take
heed,
and
beware
of
covetousness:
for
a
man's
life
consisteth
not
in
the
abundance
of
the
things
which
he
possesseth.
012:016
And
he
spake
a
parable
unto
them,
saying,
The
ground
of
a
certain
rich
man
brought
forth
plentifully:
012:017
And
he
thought
within
himself,
saying,
What
shall
I
do,
because
I
have
no
room
where
to
bestow
my
fruits?
012:018
And
he
said,
This
will
I
do:
I
will
pull
down
my
barns,
and
build
greater;
and
there
will
I
bestow
all
my
fruits
and
my
goods.
012:019
And
I
will
say
to
my
soul,
Soul,
thou
hast
much
goods
laid
up
for
many
years;
take
thine
ease,
eat,
drink,
and
be
merry.
012:020
But
God
said
unto
him,
Thou
fool,
this
night
thy
soul
shall
be
required
of
thee:
then
whose
shall
those
things
be,
which
thou
hast
provided?
012:021
So
is
he
that
layeth
up
treasure
for
himself,
and
is
not
rich
toward
God.
012:022
And
he
said
unto
his
disciples,
Therefore
I
say
unto
you,
Take
no
thought
for
your
life,
what
ye
shall
eat;
neither
for
the
body,
what
ye
shall
put
on.
012:023
The
life
is
more
than
meat,
and
the
body
is
more
than
raiment.
012:024
Consider
the
ravens:
for
they
neither
sow
nor
reap;
which
neither
have
storehouse
nor
barn;
and
God
feedeth
them:
how
much
more
are
ye
better
than
the
fowls?
012:025
And
which
of
you
with
taking
thought
can
add
to
his
stature
one
cubit?
012:026
If
ye
then
be
not
able
to
do
that
thing
which
is
least,
why
take
ye
thought
for
the
rest?
012:027
Consider
the
lilies
how
they
grow:
they
toil
not,
they
spin
not;
and
yet
I
say
unto
you,
that
Solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these.
012:028
If
then
God
so
clothe
the
grass,
which
is
to
day
in
the
field,
and
to
morrow
is
cast
into
the
oven;
how
much
more
will
he
clothe
you,
O
ye
of
little
faith?
012:029
And
seek
not
ye
what
ye
shall
eat,
or
what
ye
shall
drink,
neither
be
ye
of
doubtful
mind.
012:030
For
all
these
things
do
the
nations
of
the
world
seek
after:
and
your
Father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
these
things.
012:031
But
rather
seek
ye
the
kingdom
of
God;
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you.
012:032
Fear
not,
little
flock;
for
it
is
your
Father's
good
pleasure
to
give
you
the
kingdom.
012:033
Sell
that
ye
have,
and
give
alms;
provide
yourselves
bags
which
wax
not
old,
a
treasure
in
the
heavens
that
faileth
not,
where
no
thief
approacheth,
neither
moth
corrupteth.
012:034
For
where
your
treasure
is,
there
will
your
heart
be
also.
012:035
Let
your
loins
be
girded
about,
and
your
lights
burning;
012:036
And
ye
yourselves
like
unto
men
that
wait
for
their
lord,
when
he
will
return
from
the
wedding;
that
when
he
cometh
and
knocketh,
they
may
open
unto
him
immediately.
012:037
Blessed
are
those
servants,
whom
the
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
watching:
verily
I
say
unto
you,
that
he
shall
gird
himself,
and
make
them
to
sit
down
to
meat,
and
will
come
forth
and
serve
them.
012:038
And
if
he
shall
come
in
the
second
watch,
or
come
in
the
third
watch,
and
find
them
so,
blessed
are
those
servants.
012:039
And
this
know,
that
if
the
goodman
of
the
house
had
known
what
hour
the
thief
would
come,
he
would
have
watched,
and
not
have
suffered
his
house
to
be
broken
through.
012:040
Be
ye
therefore
ready
also:
for
the
Son
of
man
cometh
at
an
hour
when
ye
think
