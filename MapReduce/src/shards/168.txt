not.
012:041
Then
Peter
said
unto
him,
Lord,
speakest
thou
this
parable
unto
us,
or
even
to
all?
012:042
And
the
Lord
said,
Who
then
is
that
faithful
and
wise
steward,
whom
his
lord
shall
make
ruler
over
his
household,
to
give
them
their
portion
of
meat
in
due
season?
012:043
Blessed
is
that
servant,
whom
his
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
so
doing.
012:044
Of
a
truth
I
say
unto
you,
that
he
will
make
him
ruler
over
all
that
he
hath.
012:045
But
and
if
that
servant
say
in
his
heart,
My
lord
delayeth
his
coming;
and
shall
begin
to
beat
the
menservants
and
maidens,
and
to
eat
and
drink,
and
to
be
drunken;
012:046
The
lord
of
that
servant
will
come
in
a
day
when
he
looketh
not
for
him,
and
at
an
hour
when
he
is
not
aware,
and
will
cut
him
in
sunder,
and
will
appoint
him
his
portion
with
the
unbelievers.
012:047
And
that
servant,
which
knew
his
lord's
will,
and
prepared
not
himself,
neither
did
according
to
his
will,
shall
be
beaten
with
many
stripes.
012:048
But
he
that
knew
not,
and
did
commit
things
worthy
of
stripes,
shall
be
beaten
with
few
stripes.
For
unto
whomsoever
much
is
given,
of
him
shall
be
much
required:
and
to
whom
men
have
committed
much,
of
him
they
will
ask
the
more.
012:049
I
am
come
to
send
fire
on
the
earth;
and
what
will
I,
if
it
be
already
kindled?
012:050
But
I
have
a
baptism
to
be
baptized
with;
and
how
am
I
straitened
till
it
be
accomplished!
012:051
Suppose
ye
that
I
am
come
to
give
peace
on
earth?
I
tell
you,
Nay;
but
rather
division:
012:052
For
from
henceforth
there
shall
be
five
in
one
house
divided,
three
against
two,
and
two
against
three.
012:053
The
father
shall
be
divided
against
the
son,
and
the
son
against
the
father;
the
mother
against
the
daughter,
and
the
daughter
against
the
mother;
the
mother
in
law
against
her
daughter
in
law,
and
the
daughter
in
law
against
her
mother
in
law.
012:054
And
he
said
also
to
the
people,
When
ye
see
a
cloud
rise
out
of
the
west,
straightway
ye
say,
There
cometh
a
shower;
and
so
it
is.
012:055
And
when
ye
see
the
south
wind
blow,
ye
say,
There
will
be
heat;
and
it
cometh
to
pass.
012:056
Ye
hypocrites,
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
and
of
the
earth;
but
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
discern
this
time?
012:057
Yea,
and
why
even
of
yourselves
judge
ye
not
what
is
right?
012:058
When
thou
goest
with
thine
adversary
to
the
magistrate,
as
thou
art
in
the
way,
give
diligence
that
thou
mayest
be
delivered
from
him;
lest
he
hale
thee
to
the
judge,
and
the
judge
deliver
thee
to
the
officer,
and
the
officer
cast
thee
into
prison.
012:059
I
tell
thee,
thou
shalt
not
depart
thence,
till
thou
hast
paid
the
very
last
mite.
013:001
There
were
present
at
that
season
some
that
told
him
of
the
Galilaeans,
whose
blood
Pilate
had
mingled
with
their
sacrifices.
013:002
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
them,
Suppose
ye
that
these
Galilaeans
were
sinners
above
all
the
Galilaeans,
because
they
suffered
such
things?
013:003
I
tell
you,
Nay:
but,
except
ye
repent,
ye
shall
all
likewise
perish.
013:004
Or
those
eighteen,
upon
whom
the
tower
in
Siloam
fell,
and
slew
them,
think
ye
that
they
were
sinners
above
all
men
that
dwelt
in
Jerusalem?
013:005
I
tell
you,
Nay:
but,
except
ye
repent,
ye
shall
all
likewise
perish.
013:006
He
spake
also
this
parable;
A
certain
man
had
a
fig
tree
planted
in
his
vineyard;
and
he
came
and
sought
fruit
thereon,
and
found
none.
013:007
Then
said
he
unto
the
dresser
of
his
vineyard,
Behold,
these
three
years
I
come
seeking
fruit
on
this
fig
tree,
and
find
none:
cut
it
down;
why
cumbereth
it
the
ground?
013:008
And
he
answering
said
unto
him,
Lord,
let
it
alone
this
year
also,
till
I
shall
dig
about
it,
and
dung
it:
013:009
And
if
it
bear
fruit,
well:
and
if
not,
then
after
that
thou
shalt
cut
it
down.
013:010
And
he
was
teaching
in
one
of
the
synagogues
on
the
sabbath.
013:011
And,
behold,
there
was
a
woman
which
had
a
spirit
of
infirmity
eighteen
years,
and
was
bowed
together,
and
could
in
no
wise
lift
up
herself.
013:012
And
when
Jesus
saw
her,
he
called
her
to
him,
and
said
unto
her,
Woman,
thou
art
loosed
from
thine
infirmity.
013:013
And
he
laid
his
hands
on
her:
and
immediately
she
was
made
straight,
and
glorified
God.
013:014
And
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue
answered
with
indignation,
because
that
Jesus
had
healed
on
the
sabbath
day,
and
said
unto
the
people,
There
are
six
days
in
which
men
ought
to
work:
in
them
therefore
come
and
be
healed,
and
not
on
the
sabbath
day.
013:015
The
Lord
then
answered
him,
and
said,
Thou
hypocrite,
doth
not
each
one
of
you
on
the
sabbath
loose
his
ox
or
his
ass
from
the
stall,
and
lead
him
away
to
watering?
013:016
And
ought
not
this
woman,
being
a
daughter
of
Abraham,
whom
Satan
hath
bound,
lo,
these
eighteen
years,
be
loosed
from
this
bond
on
the
sabbath
day?
013:017
And
when
he
had
said
these
things,
all
his
adversaries
were
ashamed:
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
for
all
the
glorious
things
that
were
done
by
him.
013:018
Then
said
he,
Unto
what
is
the
kingdom
of
God
like?
and
whereunto
shall
I
resemble
it?
013:019
It
is
like
a
grain
of
mustard
seed,
which
a
man
took,
and
cast
into
his
garden;
and
it
grew,
and
waxed
a
great
tree;
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
lodged
in
the
branches
of
it.
013:020
And
again
he
said,
Whereunto
shall
I
liken
the
kingdom
of
God?
013:021
It
is
like
leaven,
which
a
woman
took
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
meal,
till
the
whole
was
leavened.
013:022
And
he
went
through
the
cities
and
villages,
teaching,
and
journeying
toward
Jerusalem.
013:023
Then
said
one
unto
him,
Lord,
are
there
few
that
be
saved?
And
he
said
unto
them,
013:024
Strive
to
enter
in
at
the
strait
gate:
for
many,
I
say
unto
you,
will
seek
to
enter
in,
and
shall
not
be
able.
013:025
When
once
the
master
of
the
house
is
risen
up,
and
hath
shut
to
the
door,
and
ye
begin
to
stand
without,
and
to
knock
at
the
door,
saying,
Lord,
Lord,
open
unto
us;
and
he
shall
answer
and
say
unto
you,
I
know
you
not
whence
ye
are:
013:026
Then
shall
ye
begin
to
say,
We
have
eaten
and
drunk
in
thy
presence,
and
thou
hast
taught
in
our
streets.
013:027
But
he
shall
say,
I
tell
you,
I
know
you
not
whence
ye
are;
depart
from
me,
all
ye
workers
of
iniquity.
013:028
There
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth,
when
ye
shall
see
Abraham,
and
Isaac,
and
Jacob,
and
all
the
prophets,
in
the
kingdom
of
God,
and
you
yourselves
thrust
out.
013:029
And
they
shall
come
from
the
east,
and
from
the
west,
and
from
the
north,
and
from
the
south,
and
shall
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
God.
013:030
And,
behold,
there
are
last
which
shall
be
first,
and
there
are
first
which
shall
be
last.
013:031
The
same
day
there
came
certain
of
the
Pharisees,
saying
unto
him,
Get
thee
out,
and
depart
hence:
for
Herod
will
kill
thee.
013:032
And
he
said
unto
them,
Go
ye,
and
tell
that
fox,
Behold,
I
cast
out
devils,
and
I
do
cures
to
day
and
to
morrow,
and
the
third
day
I
shall
be
perfected.
013:033
Nevertheless
I
must
walk
to
day,
and
to
morrow,
and
the
day
following:
for
it
cannot
be
that
a
prophet
perish
out
of
Jerusalem.
013:034
O
Jerusalem,
Jerusalem,
which
killest
the
prophets,
and
stonest
them
that
are
sent
unto
thee;
how
often
would
I
have
gathered
thy
children
together,
as
a
hen
doth
gather
her
brood
under
her
wings,
and
ye
would
not!
013:035
Behold,
your
house
is
left
unto
you
desolate:
and
verily
I
say
unto
you,
Ye
shall
not
see
me,
until
the
time
come
when
ye
shall
say,
Blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Lord.
014:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
went
into
the
house
of
one
of
the
chief
Pharisees
to
eat
bread
on
the
sabbath
day,
that
they
watched
him.
014:002
And,
behold,
there
was
a
certain
man
before
him
which
had
the
dropsy.
014:003
And
Jesus
answering
spake
unto
the
lawyers
and
Pharisees,
saying,
Is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
day?
014:004
And
they
held
their
peace.
And
he
took
him,
and
healed
him,
and
let
him
go;
014:005
And
answered
them,
saying,
Which
of
you
shall
have
an
ass
or
an
ox
fallen
into
a
pit,
and
will
not
straightway
pull
him
out
on
the
sabbath
day?
014:006
And
they
could
not
answer
him
again
to
these
things.
014:007
And
he
put
forth
a
parable
to
those
which
were
bidden,
when
he
marked
how
they
chose
out
the
chief
rooms;
saying
unto
them.
014:008
When
thou
art
bidden
of
any
man
to
a
wedding,
sit
not
down
in
the
highest
room;
lest
a
more
honourable
man
than
thou
be
bidden
of
him;
014:009
And
he
that
bade
thee
and
him
come
and
say
to
thee,
Give
this
man
place;
and
thou
begin
with
shame
to
take
the
lowest
room.
014:010
But
when
thou
art
bidden,
go
and
sit
down
in
the
lowest
room;
that
when
he
that
bade
thee
cometh,
he
may
say
unto
thee,
Friend,
go
up
higher:
then
shalt
thou
have
worship
in
the
presence
of
them
that
sit
at
meat
with
thee.
014:011
For
whosoever
exalteth
himself
shall
be
abased;
and
he
that
humbleth
himself
shall
be
exalted.
014:012
Then
said
he
also
to
him
that
bade
him,
When
thou
makest
a
dinner
or
a
supper,
call
not
thy
friends,
nor
thy
brethren,
neither
thy
kinsmen,
nor
thy
rich
neighbours;
lest
they
also
bid
thee
again,
and
a
recompence
be
made
thee.
014:013
But
when
thou
makest
a
feast,
call
the
poor,
the
maimed,
the
lame,
the
blind:
014:014
And
thou
shalt
be
blessed;
for
they
cannot
recompense
thee:
for
thou
shalt
be
recompensed
at
the
resurrection
of
the
just.
014:015
And
when
one
of
them
that
sat
at
meat
with
him
heard
these
things,
he
said
unto
him,
Blessed
is
he
that
shall
eat
bread
in
the
kingdom
of
God.
014:016
Then
said
he
unto
him,
A
certain
man
made
a
great
supper,
and
bade
many:
014:017
And
sent
his
servant
at
supper
time
to
say
to
them
that
were
bidden,
Come;
for
all
things
are
now
ready.
014:018
And
they
all
with
one
consent
began
to
make
excuse.
The
first
said
unto
him,
I
have
bought
a
piece
of
ground,
and
I
must
needs
go
and
see
it:
I
pray
thee
have
me
excused.
014:019
And
another
said,
I
have
bought
five
yoke
of
oxen,
and
I
go
to
prove
them:
I
pray
thee
have
me
excused.
014:020
And
another
said,
I
have
married
a
wife,
and
therefore
I
cannot
come.
014:021
So
that
servant
came,
and
shewed
his
lord
these
things.
Then
the
master
of
the
house
being
angry
said
to
his
servant,
Go
out
quickly
into
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
city,
and
bring
in
hither
the
poor,
and
the
maimed,
and
the
halt,
and
the
blind.
014:022
And
the
servant
said,
Lord,
it
is
done
as
thou
hast
commanded,
and
yet
there
is
room.
014:023
And
the
lord
said
unto
the
servant,
Go
out
into
the
highways
and
hedges,
and
compel
them
to
come
in,
that
my
house
may
be
filled.
014:024
For
I
say
unto
you,
That
none
of
those
men
which
were
bidden
shall
taste
of
my
supper.
014:025
And
there
went
great
multitudes
with
him:
and
he
turned,
and
said
unto
them,
014:026
If
any
man
come
to
me,
and
hate
not
his
father,
and
mother,
and
wife,
and
children,
and
brethren,
and
sisters,
yea,
and
his
own
life
also,
he
cannot
be
my
disciple.
014:027
And
whosoever
doth
not
bear
his
cross,
and
come
after
me,
cannot
be
my
disciple.
014:028
For
which
of
you,
intending
to
build
a
tower,
sitteth
not
down
first,
and
counteth
the
cost,
whether
he
have
sufficient
to
finish
it?
014:029
Lest
haply,
after
he
hath
laid
the
foundation,
and
is
not
able
to
finish
it,
all
that
behold
it
begin
to
mock
him,
014:030
Saying,
This
man
began
to
build,
and
was
not
able
to
finish.
014:031
Or
what
king,
going
to
make
war
against
another
king,
sitteth
not
down
first,
and
consulteth
whether
he
be
able
with
ten
thousand
to
meet
him
that
cometh
against
him
with
twenty
thousand?
014:032
Or
else,
while
the
other
is
yet
a
great
way
off,
he
sendeth
an
ambassage,
and
desireth
conditions
of
peace.
014:033
So
likewise,
whosoever
he
be
of
you
that
forsaketh
not
all
that
he
hath,
he
cannot
be
my
disciple.
014:034
Salt
is
good:
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
savour,
wherewith
shall
it
be
seasoned?
014:035
It
is
neither
fit
for
the
land,
nor
yet
for
the
dunghill;
but
men
cast
it
out.
He
that
hath
ears
to
hear,
let
him
hear.
015:001
Then
drew
near
unto
him
all
the
publicans
and
sinners
for
to
hear
him.
015:002
And
the
Pharisees
and
scribes
murmured,
saying,
This
man
receiveth
sinners,
and
eateth
with
them.
015:003
And
he
spake
this
parable
unto
them,
saying,
015:004
What
man
of
you,
having
an
hundred
sheep,
if
he
lose
one
of
them,
doth
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
in
the
wilderness,
and
go
after
that
which
is
lost,
until
he
find
it?
015:005
And
when
he
hath
found
it,
he
layeth
it
on
his
shoulders,
rejoicing.
015:006
And
when
he
cometh
home,
he
calleth
together
his
friends
and
neighbours,
saying
unto
them,
Rejoice
with
me;
for
I
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost.
015:007
I
say
unto
you,
that
likewise
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth,
more
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons,
which
need
no
repentance.
015:008
Either
what
woman
having
ten
pieces
of
silver,
if
she
lose
one
piece,
doth
not
light
a
candle,
and
sweep
the
house,
and
seek
diligently
till
she
find
it?
015:009
And
when
she
hath
found
it,
she
calleth
her
friends
and
her
neighbours
together,
saying,
Rejoice
with
me;
for
I
have
found
the
piece
which
I
had
lost.
015:010
Likewise,
I
say
unto
you,
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
God
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth.
015:011
And
he
said,
A
certain
man
had
two
sons:
015:012
And
the
younger
of
them
said
to
his
father,
Father,
give
me
the
portion
of
goods
that
falleth
to
me.
And
he
divided
unto
them
his
living.
015:013
And
not
many
days
after
the
younger
son
gathered
all
together,
and
took
his
journey
into
a
far
country,
and
there
wasted
his
substance
with
riotous
living.
015:014
And
when
he
had
spent
all,
there
arose
a
mighty
famine
in
that
land;
and
he
began
to
be
in
want.
015:015
And
he
went
and
joined
himself
to
a
citizen
of
that
country;
and
he
sent
him
into
his
fields
to
feed
swine.
015:016
And
he
would
fain
have
filled
his
belly
with
the
husks
that
the
swine
did
eat:
and
no
man
gave
unto
him.
015:017
And
when
he
came
to
himself,
he
said,
How
many
hired
servants
of
my
father's
have
bread
enough
and
to
spare,
and
I
perish
with
hunger!
015:018
I
will
arise
and
go
to
my
father,
and
will
say
unto
him,
Father,
I
have
sinned
against
heaven,
and
before
thee,
015:019
And
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son:
make
me
as
one
of
thy
hired
servants.
015:020
And
he
arose,
and
came
to
his
father.
But
when
he
was
yet
a
great
way
off,
his
father
saw
him,
and
had
compassion,
and
ran,
and
fell
on
his
neck,
and
kissed
him.
015:021
And
the
son
said
unto
him,
Father,
I
have
sinned
against
heaven,
and
in
thy
sight,
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son.
015:022
But
the
father
said
to
his
servants,
Bring
forth
the
best
robe,
and
put
it
on
him;
and
put
a
ring
on
his
hand,
and
shoes
on
his
feet:
015:023
And
bring
hither
the
fatted
calf,
and
kill
it;
and
let
us
eat,
and
be
merry:
015:024
For
this
my
son
was
dead,
and
is
alive
again;
he
was
lost,
and
is
found.
And
they
began
to
be
merry.
015:025
Now
his
elder
son
was
in
the
field:
and
as
he
came
and
drew
nigh
to
the
house,
he
heard
musick
and
dancing.
015:026
And
he
called
one
of
the
servants,
and
asked
what
these
things
meant.
015:027
And
he
said
unto
him,
Thy
brother
is
come;
and
thy
father
hath
killed
the
fatted
calf,
because
he
hath
received
him
safe
and
sound.
015:028
And
he
was
angry,
and
would
not
go
in:
therefore
came
his
father
out,
and
intreated
him.
015:029
And
he
answering
said
to
his
father,
Lo,
these
many
years
do
I
serve
thee,
neither
transgressed
I
at
any
time
thy
commandment:
and
yet
thou
never
gavest
me
a
kid,
that
I
might
make
merry
with
my
friends:
015:030
But
as
soon
as
this
thy
son
was
come,
which
hath
devoured
thy
living
with
harlots,
thou
hast
killed
for
him
the
fatted
calf.
015:031
And
he
said
unto
him,
Son,
thou
art
ever
with
me,
and
all
that
I
have
is
thine.
015:032
It
was
meet
that
we
should
make
merry,
and
be
glad:
for
this
thy
brother
was
dead,
and
is
alive
again;
and
was
lost,
and
is
found.
016:001
And
he
said
also
unto
his
disciples,
There
was
a
certain
rich
man,
which
had
a
steward;
and
the
same
was
accused
unto
him
that
he
had
wasted
his
goods.
016:002
And
he
called
him,
and
said
unto
him,
How
is
it
that
I
hear
this
of
thee?
give
an
account
of
thy
stewardship;
for
thou
mayest
be
no
longer
steward.
016:003
Then
the
steward
said
within
himself,
What
shall
I
do?
for
my
lord
taketh
away
from
me
the
stewardship:
I
cannot
dig;
to
beg
I
am
ashamed.
016:004
I
am
resolved
what
to
do,
that,
when
I
am
put
out
of
the
stewardship,
they
may
receive
me
into
their
houses.
016:005
So
he
called
every
one
of
his
lord's
debtors
unto
him,
and
said
unto
the
first,
How
much
owest
thou
unto
my
lord?
016:006
And
he
said,
An
hundred
measures
of
oil.
And
he
said
unto
him,
Take
thy
bill,
and
sit
down
quickly,
and
write
fifty.
016:007
Then
said
he
to
another,
And
how
much
owest
thou?
And
he
said,
An
hundred
measures
of
wheat.
And
he
said
unto
him,
Take
thy
bill,
and
write
fourscore.
016:008
And
the
lord
commended
the
unjust
steward,
because
he
had
done
wisely:
for
the
children
of
this
world
are
in
their
generation
wiser
than
the
children
of
light.
016:009
And
I
say
unto
you,
Make
to
yourselves
friends
of
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness;
that,
when
ye
fail,
they
may
receive
you
into
everlasting
habitations.
016:010
He
that
is
faithful
in
that
which
is
least
is
faithful
also
in
much:
and
he
that
is
unjust
in
the
least
is
unjust
also
in
much.
016:011
If
therefore
ye
have
not
been
faithful
in
the
unrighteous
mammon,
who
will
commit
to
your
trust
the
true
riches?
016:012
And
if
ye
have
not
been
faithful
in
that
which
is
another
man's,
who
shall
give
you
that
which
is
your
own?
016:013
No
servant
can
serve
two
masters:
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one,
and
love
the
other;
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one,
and
despise
the
other.
Ye
cannot
serve
God
and
mammon.
016:014
And
the
Pharisees
also,
who
were
covetous,
heard
all
these
things:
and
they
derided
him.
016:015
And
he
said
unto
them,
Ye
are
they
which
justify
yourselves
before
men;
but
God
knoweth
your
hearts:
for
that
which
is
highly
esteemed
among
men
is
abomination
in
the
sight
of
God.
016:016
The
law
and
the
prophets
were
until
John:
since
that
time
the
kingdom
of
God
is
preached,
and
every
man
presseth
into
it.
016:017
And
it
is
easier
for
heaven
and
earth
to
pass,
than
one
tittle
of
the
law
to
fail.
016:018
Whosoever
putteth
away
his
wife,
and
marrieth
another,
committeth
adultery:
and
whosoever
marrieth
her
that
is
put
away
from
her
husband
committeth
adultery.
016:019
There
was
a
certain
rich
man,
which
was
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
linen,
and
fared
sumptuously
every
day:
016:020
And
there
was
a
certain
beggar
named
Lazarus,
which
was
laid
at
his
gate,
full
of
sores,
016:021
And
desiring
to
be
fed
with
the
crumbs
which
fell
from
the
rich
man's
table:
moreover
the
dogs
came
and
licked
his
sores.
016:022
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
the
beggar
died,
and
was
carried
by
the
angels
into
Abraham's
bosom:
the
rich
man
also
died,
and
was
buried;
016:023
And
in
hell
he
lift
up
his
eyes,
being
in
torments,
and
seeth
Abraham
afar
off,
and
Lazarus
in
his
bosom.
016:024
And
he
cried
and
said,
Father
Abraham,
have
mercy
on
me,
and
send
Lazarus,
that
he
may
dip
the
tip
of
his
finger
in
water,
and
cool
my
tongue;
for
I
am
tormented
in
this
flame.
016:025
But
Abraham
said,
Son,
remember
that
thou
in
thy
lifetime
receivedst
thy
good
things,
and
likewise
Lazarus
evil
things:
but
now
he
is
comforted,
and
thou
art
tormented.
016:026
And
beside
all
this,
between
us
and
you
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed:
so
that
they
which
would
pass
from
hence
to
you
cannot;
neither
can
they
pass
to
us,
that
would
come
from
thence.
016:027
Then
he
said,
I
pray
thee
therefore,
father,
that
thou
wouldest
send
him
to
my
father's
house:
016:028
For
I
have
five
brethren;
that
he
may
testify
unto
them,
lest
they
also
come
into
this
place
of
torment.
016:029
Abraham
saith
unto
him,
They
have
Moses
and
the
prophets;
let
them
hear
them.
016:030
And
he
said,
Nay,
father
Abraham:
but
if
one
went
unto
them
from
the
dead,
they
will
repent.
016:031
And
he
said
unto
him,
If
they
hear
not
Moses
and
the
prophets,
neither
will
they
be
persuaded,
though
one
rose
from
the
dead.
017:001
Then
said
he
unto
the
disciples,
It
is
impossible
but
that
offences
will
come:
but
woe
unto
him,
through
whom
they
come!
017:002
It
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck,
and
he
cast
into
the
sea,
than
that
he
should
offend
one
of
these
little
ones.
017:003
Take
heed
to
yourselves:
If
thy
brother
trespass
against
thee,
rebuke
him;
and
if
he
repent,
forgive
him.
017:004
And
if
he
trespass
against
thee
seven
times
in
a
day,
and
seven
times
in
a
day
turn
again
to
thee,
saying,
I
repent;
thou
shalt
forgive
him.
017:005
And
the
apostles
said
unto
the
Lord,
Increase
our
faith.
017:006
And
the
Lord
said,
If
ye
had
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed,
ye
might
say
unto
this
sycamine
tree,
Be
thou
plucked
up
by
the
root,
and
be
thou
planted
in
the
sea;
and
it
should
obey
you.
017:007
But
which
of
you,
having
a
servant
plowing
or
feeding
cattle,
will
say
unto
him
by
and
by,
when
he
is
come
from
the
field,
Go
and
sit
down
to
meat?
017:008
And
will
not
rather
say
unto
him,
Make
ready
wherewith
I
may
sup,
and
gird
thyself,
and
serve
me,
till
I
have
eaten
and
drunken;
and
afterward
thou
shalt
eat
and
drink?
017:009
Doth
he
thank
that
servant
because
he
did
the
things
that
were
commanded
him?
I
trow
not.
017:010
So
likewise
ye,
when
ye
shall
have
done
all
those
things
which
are
commanded
you,
say,
We
are
unprofitable
servants:
we
have
done
that
which
was
our
duty
to
do.
017:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
went
to
Jerusalem,
that
he
passed
through
the
midst
of
Samaria
and
Galilee.
017:012
And
as
he
entered
into
a
certain
village,
there
met
him
ten
men
that
were
lepers,
which
stood
afar
off:
