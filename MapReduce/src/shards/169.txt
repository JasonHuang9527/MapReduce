017:013
And
they
lifted
up
their
voices,
and
said,
Jesus,
Master,
have
mercy
on
us.
017:014
And
when
he
saw
them,
he
said
unto
them,
Go
shew
yourselves
unto
the
priests.
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
as
they
went,
they
were
cleansed.
017:015
And
one
of
them,
when
he
saw
that
he
was
healed,
turned
back,
and
with
a
loud
voice
glorified
God,
017:016
And
fell
down
on
his
face
at
his
feet,
giving
him
thanks:
and
he
was
a
Samaritan.
017:017
And
Jesus
answering
said,
Were
there
not
ten
cleansed?
but
where
are
the
nine?
017:018
There
are
not
found
that
returned
to
give
glory
to
God,
save
this
stranger.
017:019
And
he
said
unto
him,
Arise,
go
thy
way:
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole.
017:020
And
when
he
was
demanded
of
the
Pharisees,
when
the
kingdom
of
God
should
come,
he
answered
them
and
said,
The
kingdom
of
God
cometh
not
with
observation:
017:021
Neither
shall
they
say,
Lo
here!
or,
lo
there!
for,
behold,
the
kingdom
of
God
is
within
you.
017:022
And
he
said
unto
the
disciples,
The
days
will
come,
when
ye
shall
desire
to
see
one
of
the
days
of
the
Son
of
man,
and
ye
shall
not
see
it.
017:023
And
they
shall
say
to
you,
See
here;
or,
see
there:
go
not
after
them,
nor
follow
them.
017:024
For
as
the
lightning,
that
lighteneth
out
of
the
one
part
under
heaven,
shineth
unto
the
other
part
under
heaven;
so
shall
also
the
Son
of
man
be
in
his
day.
017:025
But
first
must
he
suffer
many
things,
and
be
rejected
of
this
generation.
017:026
And
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
Noe,
so
shall
it
be
also
in
the
days
of
the
Son
of
man.
017:027
They
did
eat,
they
drank,
they
married
wives,
they
were
given
in
marriage,
until
the
day
that
Noe
entered
into
the
ark,
and
the
flood
came,
and
destroyed
them
all.
017:028
Likewise
also
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
Lot;
they
did
eat,
they
drank,
they
bought,
they
sold,
they
planted,
they
builded;
017:029
But
the
same
day
that
Lot
went
out
of
Sodom
it
rained
fire
and
brimstone
from
heaven,
and
destroyed
them
all.
017:030
Even
thus
shall
it
be
in
the
day
when
the
Son
of
man
is
revealed.
017:031
In
that
day,
he
which
shall
be
upon
the
housetop,
and
his
stuff
in
the
house,
let
him
not
come
down
to
take
it
away:
and
he
that
is
in
the
field,
let
him
likewise
not
return
back.
017:032
Remember
Lot's
wife.
017:033
Whosoever
shall
seek
to
save
his
life
shall
lose
it;
and
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
shall
preserve
it.
017:034
I
tell
you,
in
that
night
there
shall
be
two
men
in
one
bed;
the
one
shall
be
taken,
and
the
other
shall
be
left.
017:035
Two
women
shall
be
grinding
together;
the
one
shall
be
taken,
and
the
other
left.
017:036
Two
men
shall
be
in
the
field;
the
one
shall
be
taken,
and
the
other
left.
017:037
And
they
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Where,
Lord?
And
he
said
unto
them,
Wheresoever
the
body
is,
thither
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
together.
018:001
And
he
spake
a
parable
unto
them
to
this
end,
that
men
ought
always
to
pray,
and
not
to
faint;
018:002
Saying,
There
was
in
a
city
a
judge,
which
feared
not
God,
neither
regarded
man:
018:003
And
there
was
a
widow
in
that
city;
and
she
came
unto
him,
saying,
Avenge
me
of
mine
adversary.
018:004
And
he
would
not
for
a
while:
but
afterward
he
said
within
himself,
Though
I
fear
not
God,
nor
regard
man;
018:005
Yet
because
this
widow
troubleth
me,
I
will
avenge
her,
lest
by
her
continual
coming
she
weary
me.
018:006
And
the
Lord
said,
Hear
what
the
unjust
judge
saith.
018:007
And
shall
not
God
avenge
his
own
elect,
which
cry
day
and
night
unto
him,
though
he
bear
long
with
them?
018:008
I
tell
you
that
he
will
avenge
them
speedily.
Nevertheless
when
the
Son
of
man
cometh,
shall
he
find
faith
on
the
earth?
018:009
And
he
spake
this
parable
unto
certain
which
trusted
in
themselves
that
they
were
righteous,
and
despised
others:
018:010
Two
men
went
up
into
the
temple
to
pray;
the
one
a
Pharisee,
and
the
other
a
publican.
018:011
The
Pharisee
stood
and
prayed
thus
with
himself,
God,
I
thank
thee,
that
I
am
not
as
other
men
are,
extortioners,
unjust,
adulterers,
or
even
as
this
publican.
018:012
I
fast
twice
in
the
week,
I
give
tithes
of
all
that
I
possess.
018:013
And
the
publican,
standing
afar
off,
would
not
lift
up
so
much
as
his
eyes
unto
heaven,
but
smote
upon
his
breast,
saying,
God
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner.
018:014
I
tell
you,
this
man
went
down
to
his
house
justified
rather
than
the
other:
for
every
one
that
exalteth
himself
shall
be
abased;
and
he
that
humbleth
himself
shall
be
exalted.
018:015
And
they
brought
unto
him
also
infants,
that
he
would
touch
them:
but
when
his
disciples
saw
it,
they
rebuked
them.
018:016
But
Jesus
called
them
unto
him,
and
said,
Suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me,
and
forbid
them
not:
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
God.
018:017
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
Whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
God
as
a
little
child
shall
in
no
wise
enter
therein.
018:018
And
a
certain
ruler
asked
him,
saying,
Good
Master,
what
shall
I
do
to
inherit
eternal
life?
018:019
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Why
callest
thou
me
good?
none
is
good,
save
one,
that
is,
God.
018:020
Thou
knowest
the
commandments,
Do
not
commit
adultery,
Do
not
kill,
Do
not
steal,
Do
not
bear
false
witness,
Honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother.
018:021
And
he
said,
All
these
have
I
kept
from
my
youth
up.
018:022
Now
when
Jesus
heard
these
things,
he
said
unto
him,
Yet
lackest
thou
one
thing:
sell
all
that
thou
hast,
and
distribute
unto
the
poor,
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven:
and
come,
follow
me.
018:023
And
when
he
heard
this,
he
was
very
sorrowful:
for
he
was
very
rich.
018:024
And
when
Jesus
saw
that
he
was
very
sorrowful,
he
said,
How
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God!
018:025
For
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
a
needle's
eye,
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God.
018:026
And
they
that
heard
it
said,
Who
then
can
be
saved?
018:027
And
he
said,
The
things
which
are
impossible
with
men
are
possible
with
God.
018:028
Then
Peter
said,
Lo,
we
have
left
all,
and
followed
thee.
018:029
And
he
said
unto
them,
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
There
is
no
man
that
hath
left
house,
or
parents,
or
brethren,
or
wife,
or
children,
for
the
kingdom
of
God's
sake,
018:030
Who
shall
not
receive
manifold
more
in
this
present
time,
and
in
the
world
to
come
life
everlasting.
018:031
Then
he
took
unto
him
the
twelve,
and
said
unto
them,
Behold,
we
go
up
to
Jerusalem,
and
all
things
that
are
written
by
the
prophets
concerning
the
Son
of
man
shall
be
accomplished.
018:032
For
he
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
Gentiles,
and
shall
be
mocked,
and
spitefully
entreated,
and
spitted
on:
018:033
And
they
shall
scourge
him,
and
put
him
to
death:
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
again.
018:034
And
they
understood
none
of
these
things:
and
this
saying
was
hid
from
them,
neither
knew
they
the
things
which
were
spoken.
018:035
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
as
he
was
come
nigh
unto
Jericho,
a
certain
blind
man
sat
by
the
way
side
begging:
018:036
And
hearing
the
multitude
pass
by,
he
asked
what
it
meant.
018:037
And
they
told
him,
that
Jesus
of
Nazareth
passeth
by.
018:038
And
he
cried,
saying,
Jesus,
thou
son
of
David,
have
mercy
on
me.
018:039
And
they
which
went
before
rebuked
him,
that
he
should
hold
his
peace:
but
he
cried
so
much
the
more,
Thou
son
of
David,
have
mercy
on
me.
018:040
And
Jesus
stood,
and
commanded
him
to
be
brought
unto
him:
and
when
he
was
come
near,
he
asked
him,
018:041
Saying,
What
wilt
thou
that
I
shall
do
unto
thee?
And
he
said,
Lord,
that
I
may
receive
my
sight.
018:042
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Receive
thy
sight:
thy
faith
hath
saved
thee.
018:043
And
immediately
he
received
his
sight,
and
followed
him,
glorifying
God:
and
all
the
people,
when
they
saw
it,
gave
praise
unto
God.
019:001
And
Jesus
entered
and
passed
through
Jericho.
019:002
And,
behold,
there
was
a
man
named
Zacchaeus,
which
was
the
chief
among
the
publicans,
and
he
was
rich.
019:003
And
he
sought
to
see
Jesus
who
he
was;
and
could
not
for
the
press,
because
he
was
little
of
stature.
019:004
And
he
ran
before,
and
climbed
up
into
a
sycomore
tree
to
see
him:
for
he
was
to
pass
that
way.
019:005
And
when
Jesus
came
to
the
place,
he
looked
up,
and
saw
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Zacchaeus,
make
haste,
and
come
down;
for
to
day
I
must
abide
at
thy
house.
019:006
And
he
made
haste,
and
came
down,
and
received
him
joyfully.
019:007
And
when
they
saw
it,
they
all
murmured,
saying,
That
he
was
gone
to
be
guest
with
a
man
that
is
a
sinner.
019:008
And
Zacchaeus
stood,
and
said
unto
the
Lord:
Behold,
Lord,
the
half
of
my
goods
I
give
to
the
poor;
and
if
I
have
taken
any
thing
from
any
man
by
false
accusation,
I
restore
him
fourfold.
019:009
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
This
day
is
salvation
come
to
this
house,
forsomuch
as
he
also
is
a
son
of
Abraham.
019:010
For
the
Son
of
man
is
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
lost.
019:011
And
as
they
heard
these
things,
he
added
and
spake
a
parable,
because
he
was
nigh
to
Jerusalem,
and
because
they
thought
that
the
kingdom
of
God
should
immediately
appear.
019:012
He
said
therefore,
A
certain
nobleman
went
into
a
far
country
to
receive
for
himself
a
kingdom,
and
to
return.
019:013
And
he
called
his
ten
servants,
and
delivered
them
ten
pounds,
and
said
unto
them,
Occupy
till
I
come.
019:014
But
his
citizens
hated
him,
and
sent
a
message
after
him,
saying,
We
will
not
have
this
man
to
reign
over
us.
019:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
he
was
returned,
having
received
the
kingdom,
then
he
commanded
these
servants
to
be
called
unto
him,
to
whom
he
had
given
the
money,
that
he
might
know
how
much
every
man
had
gained
by
trading.
019:016
Then
came
the
first,
saying,
Lord,
thy
pound
hath
gained
ten
pounds.
019:017
And
he
said
unto
him,
Well,
thou
good
servant:
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
in
a
very
little,
have
thou
authority
over
ten
cities.
019:018
And
the
second
came,
saying,
Lord,
thy
pound
hath
gained
five
pounds.
019:019
And
he
said
likewise
to
him,
Be
thou
also
over
five
cities.
019:020
And
another
came,
saying,
Lord,
behold,
here
is
thy
pound,
which
I
have
kept
laid
up
in
a
napkin:
019:021
For
I
feared
thee,
because
thou
art
an
austere
man:
thou
takest
up
that
thou
layedst
not
down,
and
reapest
that
thou
didst
not
sow.
019:022
And
he
saith
unto
him,
Out
of
thine
own
mouth
will
I
judge
thee,
thou
wicked
servant.
Thou
knewest
that
I
was
an
austere
man,
taking
up
that
I
laid
not
down,
and
reaping
that
I
did
not
sow:
019:023
Wherefore
then
gavest
not
thou
my
money
into
the
bank,
that
at
my
coming
I
might
have
required
mine
own
with
usury?
019:024
And
he
said
unto
them
that
stood
by,
Take
from
him
the
pound,
and
give
it
to
him
that
hath
ten
pounds.
019:025
(And
they
said
unto
him,
Lord,
he
hath
ten
pounds.)
019:026
For
I
say
unto
you,
That
unto
every
one
which
hath
shall
be
given;
and
from
him
that
hath
not,
even
that
he
hath
shall
be
taken
away
from
him.
019:027
But
those
mine
enemies,
which
would
not
that
I
should
reign
over
them,
bring
hither,
and
slay
them
before
me.
019:028
And
when
he
had
thus
spoken,
he
went
before,
ascending
up
to
Jerusalem.
019:029
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
was
come
nigh
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany,
at
the
mount
called
the
mount
of
Olives,
he
sent
two
of
his
disciples,
019:030
Saying,
Go
ye
into
the
village
over
against
you;
in
the
which
at
your
entering
ye
shall
find
a
colt
tied,
whereon
yet
never
man
sat:
loose
him,
and
bring
him
hither.
019:031
And
if
any
man
ask
you,
Why
do
ye
loose
him?
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
him,
Because
the
Lord
hath
need
of
him.
019:032
And
they
that
were
sent
went
their
way,
and
found
even
as
he
had
said
unto
them.
019:033
And
as
they
were
loosing
the
colt,
the
owners
thereof
said
unto
them,
Why
loose
ye
the
colt?
019:034
And
they
said,
The
Lord
hath
need
of
him.
019:035
And
they
brought
him
to
Jesus:
and
they
cast
their
garments
upon
the
colt,
and
they
set
Jesus
thereon.
019:036
And
as
he
went,
they
spread
their
clothes
in
the
way.
019:037
And
when
he
was
come
nigh,
even
now
at
the
descent
of
the
mount
of
Olives,
the
whole
multitude
of
the
disciples
began
to
rejoice
and
praise
God
with
a
loud
voice
for
all
the
mighty
works
that
they
had
seen;
019:038
Saying,
Blessed
be
the
King
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Lord:
peace
in
heaven,
and
glory
in
the
highest.
019:039
And
some
of
the
Pharisees
from
among
the
multitude
said
unto
him,
Master,
rebuke
thy
disciples.
019:040
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
them,
I
tell
you
that,
if
these
should
hold
their
peace,
the
stones
would
immediately
cry
out.
019:041
And
when
he
was
come
near,
he
beheld
the
city,
and
wept
over
it,
019:042
Saying,
If
thou
hadst
known,
even
thou,
at
least
in
this
thy
day,
the
things
which
belong
unto
thy
peace!
but
now
they
are
hid
from
thine
eyes.
019:043
For
the
days
shall
come
upon
thee,
that
thine
enemies
shall
cast
a
trench
about
thee,
and
compass
thee
round,
and
keep
thee
in
on
every
side,
019:044
And
shall
lay
thee
even
with
the
ground,
and
thy
children
within
thee;
and
they
shall
not
leave
in
thee
one
stone
upon
another;
because
thou
knewest
not
the
time
of
thy
visitation.
019:045
And
he
went
into
the
temple,
and
began
to
cast
out
them
that
sold
therein,
and
them
that
bought;
019:046
Saying
unto
them,
It
is
written,
My
house
is
the
house
of
prayer:
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves.
019:047
And
he
taught
daily
in
the
temple.
But
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
chief
of
the
people
sought
to
destroy
him,
019:048
And
could
not
find
what
they
might
do:
for
all
the
people
were
very
attentive
to
hear
him.
020:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
on
one
of
those
days,
as
he
taught
the
people
in
the
temple,
and
preached
the
gospel,
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
came
upon
him
with
the
elders,
020:002
And
spake
unto
him,
saying,
Tell
us,
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things?
or
who
is
he
that
gave
thee
this
authority?
020:003
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
them,
I
will
also
ask
you
one
thing;
and
answer
me:
020:004
The
baptism
of
John,
was
it
from
heaven,
or
of
men?
020:005
And
they
reasoned
with
themselves,
saying,
If
we
shall
say,
From
heaven;
he
will
say,
Why
then
believed
ye
him
not?
020:006
But
and
if
we
say,
Of
men;
all
the
people
will
stone
us:
for
they
be
persuaded
that
John
was
a
prophet.
020:007
And
they
answered,
that
they
could
not
tell
whence
it
was.
020:008
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Neither
tell
I
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things.
020:009
Then
began
he
to
speak
to
the
people
this
parable;
A
certain
man
planted
a
vineyard,
and
let
it
forth
to
husbandmen,
and
went
into
a
far
country
for
a
long
time.
020:010
And
at
the
season
he
sent
a
servant
to
the
husbandmen,
that
they
should
give
him
of
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard:
but
the
husbandmen
beat
him,
and
sent
him
away
empty.
020:011
And
again
he
sent
another
servant:
and
they
beat
him
also,
and
entreated
him
shamefully,
and
sent
him
away
empty.
020:012
And
again
he
sent
a
third:
and
they
wounded
him
also,
and
cast
him
out.
020:013
Then
said
the
lord
of
the
vineyard,
What
shall
I
do?
I
will
send
my
beloved
son:
it
may
be
they
will
reverence
him
when
they
see
him.
020:014
But
when
the
husbandmen
saw
him,
they
reasoned
among
themselves,
saying,
This
is
the
heir:
come,
let
us
kill
him,
that
the
inheritance
may
be
ours.
020:015
So
they
cast
him
out
of
the
vineyard,
and
killed
him.
What
therefore
shall
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
do
unto
them?
020:016
He
shall
come
and
destroy
these
husbandmen,
and
shall
give
the
vineyard
to
others.
And
when
they
heard
it,
they
said,
God
forbid.
020:017
And
he
beheld
them,
and
said,
What
is
this
then
that
is
written,
The
stone
which
the
builders
rejected,
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner?
020:018
Whosoever
shall
fall
upon
that
stone
shall
be
broken;
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall,
it
will
grind
him
to
powder.
020:019
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
the
same
hour
sought
to
lay
hands
on
him;
and
they
feared
the
people:
for
they
perceived
that
he
had
spoken
this
parable
against
them.
020:020
And
they
watched
him,
and
sent
forth
spies,
which
should
feign
themselves
just
men,
that
they
might
take
hold
of
his
words,
that
so
they
might
deliver
him
unto
the
power
and
authority
of
the
governor.
020:021
And
they
asked
him,
saying,
Master,
we
know
that
thou
sayest
and
teachest
rightly,
neither
acceptest
thou
the
person
of
any,
but
teachest
the
way
of
God
truly:
020:022
Is
it
lawful
for
us
to
give
tribute
unto
Caesar,
or
no?
020:023
But
he
perceived
their
craftiness,
and
said
unto
them,
Why
tempt
ye
me?
020:024
Shew
me
a
penny.
Whose
image
and
superscription
hath
it?
They
answered
and
said,
Caesar's.
020:025
And
he
said
unto
them,
Render
therefore
unto
Caesar
the
things
which
be
Caesar's,
and
unto
God
the
things
which
be
God's.
020:026
And
they
could
not
take
hold
of
his
words
before
the
people:
and
they
marvelled
at
his
answer,
and
held
their
peace.
020:027
Then
came
to
him
certain
of
the
Sadducees,
which
deny
that
there
is
any
resurrection;
and
they
asked
him,
020:028
Saying,
Master,
Moses
wrote
unto
us,
If
any
man's
brother
die,
having
a
wife,
and
he
die
without
children,
that
his
brother
should
take
his
wife,
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
brother.
020:029
There
were
therefore
seven
brethren:
and
the
first
took
a
wife,
and
died
without
children.
020:030
And
the
second
took
her
to
wife,
and
he
died
childless.
020:031
And
the
third
took
her;
and
in
like
manner
the
seven
also:
and
they
left
no
children,
and
died.
020:032
Last
of
all
the
woman
died
also.
020:033
Therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
of
them
is
she?
for
seven
had
her
to
wife.
020:034
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
them,
The
children
of
this
world
marry,
and
are
given
in
marriage:
020:035
But
they
which
shall
be
accounted
worthy
to
obtain
that
world,
and
the
resurrection
from
the
dead,
neither
marry,
nor
are
given
in
marriage:
020:036
Neither
can
they
die
any
more:
for
they
are
equal
unto
the
angels;
and
are
the
children
of
God,
being
the
children
of
the
resurrection.
020:037
Now
that
the
dead
are
raised,
even
Moses
shewed
at
the
bush,
when
he
calleth
the
Lord
the
God
of
Abraham,
and
the
God
of
Isaac,
and
the
God
of
Jacob.
020:038
For
he
is
not
a
God
of
the
dead,
but
of
the
living:
for
all
live
unto
him.
020:039
Then
certain
of
the
scribes
answering
said,
Master,
thou
hast
well
said.
020:040
And
after
that
they
durst
not
ask
him
any
question
at
all.
020:041
And
he
said
unto
them,
How
say
they
that
Christ
is
David's
son?
020:042
And
David
himself
saith
in
the
book
of
Psalms,
The
LORD
said
unto
my
Lord,
Sit
thou
on
my
right
hand,
020:043
Till
I
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool.
020:044
David
therefore
calleth
him
Lord,
how
is
he
then
his
son?
020:045
Then
in
the
audience
of
all
the
people
he
said
unto
his
disciples,
020:046
Beware
of
the
scribes,
which
desire
to
walk
in
long
robes,
and
love
greetings
in
the
markets,
and
the
highest
seats
in
the
synagogues,
and
the
chief
rooms
at
feasts;
020:047
Which
devour
widows'
houses,
and
for
a
shew
make
long
prayers:
the
same
shall
receive
greater
damnation.
021:001
And
he
looked
up,
and
saw
the
rich
men
casting
their
gifts
into
the
treasury.
021:002
And
he
saw
also
a
certain
poor
widow
casting
in
thither
two
mites.
021:003
And
he
said,
Of
a
truth
I
say
unto
you,
that
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
in
more
than
they
all:
021:004
For
all
these
have
of
their
abundance
cast
in
unto
the
offerings
of
God:
but
she
of
her
penury
hath
cast
in
all
the
living
that
she
had.
021:005
And
as
some
spake
of
the
temple,
how
it
was
adorned
with
goodly
stones
and
gifts,
he
said,
021:006
As
for
these
things
which
ye
behold,
the
days
will
come,
in
the
which
there
shall
not
be
left
one
stone
upon
another,
that
shall
not
be
thrown
down.
021:007
And
they
asked
him,
saying,
Master,
but
when
shall
these
things
be?
and
what
sign
will
there
be
when
these
things
shall
come
to
pass?
021:008
And
he
said,
Take
heed
that
ye
be
not
deceived:
for
many
shall
come
in
my
name,
saying,
I
am
Christ;
and
the
time
draweth
near:
go
ye
not
therefore
after
them.
021:009
But
when
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
commotions,
be
not
terrified:
for
these
things
must
first
come
to
pass;
but
the
end
is
not
by
and
by.
021:010
Then
said
he
unto
them,
Nation
shall
rise
against
nation,
and
kingdom
against
kingdom:
021:011
And
great
earthquakes
shall
be
in
divers
places,
and
famines,
and
pestilences;
and
fearful
sights
and
great
signs
shall
there
be
from
heaven.
021:012
But
before
all
these,
they
shall
lay
their
hands
on
you,
and
persecute
you,
delivering
you
up
to
the
synagogues,
and
into
prisons,
being
brought
before
kings
and
rulers
for
my
name's
sake.
021:013
And
it
shall
turn
to
you
for
a
testimony.
021:014
Settle
it
therefore
in
your
hearts,
not
to
meditate
before
what
ye
shall
answer:
021:015
For
I
will
give
you
a
mouth
and
wisdom,
which
all
your
adversaries
shall
not
be
able
to
gainsay
nor
resist.
021:016
And
ye
shall
be
betrayed
both
by
parents,
and
brethren,
and
kinsfolks,
and
friends;
and
some
of
you
shall
they
cause
to
be
put
to
death.
021:017
And
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name's
sake.
021:018
But
there
shall
not
an
hair
of
your
head
perish.
021:019
In
your
patience
possess
ye
your
souls.
021:020
And
when
ye
shall
see
Jerusalem
compassed
with
armies,
then
know
that
the
desolation
thereof
is
nigh.
021:021
Then
let
them
which
are
in
Judaea
flee
to
the
mountains;
and
let
them
which
are
in
the
midst
of
it
depart
out;
and
let
not
them
that
are
in
the
countries
enter
thereinto.
021:022
For
these
be
the
days
of
vengeance,
that
all
things
which
are
written
may
be
fulfilled.
021:023
But
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
child,
and
to
them
that
give
suck,
in
those
days!
for
there
shall
be
great
distress
in
the
land,
and
wrath
upon
this
people.
021:024
And
they
shall
fall
by
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
shall
be
led
away
captive
into
all
nations:
and
Jerusalem
shall
be
trodden
down
of
the
Gentiles,
until
the
times
of
the
Gentiles
be
fulfilled.
021:025
And
there
shall
be
signs
in
the
sun,
and
in
the
moon,
and
in
the
