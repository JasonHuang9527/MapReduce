And

Fifty

036:013
And
he
made
fifty

so
it

036:014
And

036:019
And

036:022
One

036:023
And

And

And

036:034
And

036:035
And

037:003
And

as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
039:002
And
he
made
the
ephod
of
gold,
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
fine
twined
linen.
039:003
And
they
did
beat
the
gold
into
thin
plates,
and
cut
it
into
wires,
to
work
it
in
the
blue,
and
in
the
purple,
and
in
the
scarlet,
and
in
the
fine
linen,
with
cunning
work.
039:004
They
made
shoulderpieces
for
it,
to
couple
it
together:
by
the
two
edges
was
it
coupled
together.
039:005
And
the
curious
girdle
of
his
ephod,
that
was
upon
it,
was
of
the
same,
according
to
the
work
thereof;
of
gold,
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
fine
twined
linen;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
039:006
And
they
wrought
onyx
stones
inclosed
in
ouches
of
gold,
graven,
as
signets
are
graven,
with
the
names
of
the
children
of
Israel.
039:007
And
he
put
them
on
the
shoulders
of
the
ephod,
that
they
should
be
stones
for
a
memorial
to
the
children
of
Israel;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
039:008
And
he
made
the
breastplate
of
cunning
work,
like
the
work
of
the
ephod;
of
gold,
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
fine
twined
linen.
039:009
It
was
foursquare;
they
made
the
breastplate
double:
a
span
was
the
length
thereof,
and
a
span
the
breadth
thereof,
being
doubled.
039:010
And
they
set
in
it
four
rows
of
stones:
the
first
row
was
a
sardius,
a
topaz,
and
a
carbuncle:
this
was
the
first
row.
039:011
And
the
second
row,
an
emerald,
a
sapphire,
and
a
diamond.
039:012
And
the
third
row,
a
ligure,
an
agate,
and
an
amethyst.
039:013
And
the
fourth
row,
a
beryl,
an
onyx,
and
a
jasper:
they
were
inclosed
in
ouches
of
gold
in
their
inclosings.
039:014
And
the
stones
were
according
to
the
names
of
the
children
of
Israel,
twelve,
according
to
their
names,
like
the
engravings
of
a
signet,
every
one
with
his
name,
according
to
the
twelve
tribes.
039:015
And
they
made
upon
the
breastplate
chains
at
the
ends,
of
wreathen
work
of
pure
gold.
039:016
And
they
made
two
ouches
of
gold,
and
two
gold
rings;
and
put
the
two
rings
in
the
two
ends
of
the
breastplate.
039:017
And
they
put
the
two
wreathen
chains
of
gold
in
the
two
rings
on
the
ends
of
the
breastplate.
039:018
And
the
two
ends
of
the
two
wreathen
chains
they
fastened
in
the
two
ouches,
and
put
them
on
the
shoulderpieces
of
the
ephod,
before
it.
039:019
And
they
made
two
rings
of
gold,
and
put
them
on
the
two
ends
of
the
breastplate,
upon
the
border
of
it,
which
was
on
the
side
of
the
ephod
inward.
039:020
And
they
made
two
other
golden
rings,
and
put
them
on
the
two
sides
of
the
ephod
underneath,
toward
the
forepart
of
it,
over
against
the
other
coupling
thereof,
above
the
curious
girdle
of
the
ephod.
039:021
And
they
did
bind
the
breastplate
by
his
rings
unto
the
rings
of
the
ephod
with
a
lace
of
blue,
that
it
might
be
above
the
curious
girdle
of
the
ephod,
and
that
the
breastplate
might
not
be
loosed
from
the
ephod;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
039:022
And
he
made
the
robe
of
the
ephod
of
woven
work,
all
of
blue.
039:023
And
there
was
an
hole
in
the
midst
of
the
robe,
as
the
hole
of
an
habergeon,
with
a
band
round
about
the
hole,
that
it
should
not
rend.
039:024
And
they
made
upon
the
hems
of
the
robe
pomegranates
of
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
twined
linen.
039:025
And
they
made
bells
of
pure
gold,
and
put
the
bells
between
the
pomegranates
upon
the
hem
of
the
robe,
round
about
between
the
pomegranates;
039:026
A
bell
and
a
pomegranate,
a
bell
and
a
pomegranate,
round
about
the
hem
of
the
robe
to
minister
in;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
039:027
And
they
made
coats
of
fine
linen
of
woven
work
for
Aaron,
and
for
his
sons,
039:028
And
a
mitre
of
fine
linen,
and
goodly
bonnets
of
fine
linen,
and
linen
breeches
of
fine
twined
linen,
039:029
And
a
girdle
of
fine
twined
linen,
and
blue,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
of
needlework;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
039:030
And
they
made
the
plate
of
the
holy
crown
of
pure
gold,
and
wrote
upon
it
a
writing,
like
to
the
engravings
of
a
signet,
HOLINESS
TO
THE
LORD.
039:031
And
they
tied
unto
it
a
lace
of
blue,
to
fasten
it
on
high
upon
the
mitre;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
039:032
Thus
was
all
the
work
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
tent
of
the
congregation
finished:
and
the
children
of
Israel
did
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
commanded
Moses,
so
did
they.
039:033
And
they
brought
the
tabernacle
unto
Moses,
the
tent,
and
all
his
furniture,
his
taches,
his
boards,
his
bars,
and
his
pillars,
and
his
sockets,
039:034
And
the
covering
of
rams'
skins
dyed
red,
and
the
covering
of
badgers'
skins,
and
the
vail
of
the
covering,
039:035
The
ark
of
the
testimony,
and
the
staves
thereof,
and
the
mercy
seat,
039:036
The
table,
and
all
the
vessels
thereof,
and
the
shewbread,
039:037
The
pure
candlestick,
with
the
lamps
thereof,
even
with
the
lamps
to
be
set
in
order,
and
all
the
vessels
thereof,
and
the
oil
for
light,
039:038
And
the
golden
altar,
and
the
anointing
oil,
and
the
sweet
incense,
and
the
hanging
for
the
tabernacle
door,
039:039
The
brasen
altar,
and
his
grate
of
brass,
his
staves,
and
all
his
vessels,
the
laver
and
his
foot,
039:040
The
hangings
of
the
court,
his
pillars,
and
his
sockets,
and
the
hanging
for
the
court
gate,
his
cords,
and
his
pins,
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
service
of
the
tabernacle,
for
the
tent
of
the
congregation,
039:041
The
cloths
of
service
to
do
service
in
the
holy
place,
and
the
holy
garments
for
Aaron
the
priest,
and
his
sons'
garments,
to
minister
in
the
priest's
office.
039:042
According
to
all
that
the
LORD
commanded
Moses,
so
the
children
of
Israel
made
all
the
work.
039:043
And
Moses
did
look
upon
all
the
work,
and,
behold,
they
had
done
it
as
the
LORD
had
commanded,
even
so
had
they
done
it:
and
Moses
blessed
them.
040:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
040:002
On
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
shalt
thou
set
up
the
tabernacle
of
the
tent
of
the
congregation.
040:003
And
thou
shalt
put
therein
the
ark
of
the
testimony,
and
cover
the
ark
with
the
vail.
040:004
And
thou
shalt
bring
in
the
table,
and
set
in
order
the
things
that
are
to
be
set
in
order
upon
it;
and
thou
shalt
bring
in
the
candlestick,
and
light
the
lamps
thereof.
040:005
And
thou
shalt
set
the
altar
of
gold
for
the
incense
before
the
ark
of
the
testimony,
and
put
the
hanging
of
the
door
to
the
tabernacle.
040:006
And
thou
shalt
set
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering
before
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
tent
of
the
congregation.
040:007
And
thou
shalt
set
the
laver
between
the
tent
of
the
congregation
and
the
altar,
and
shalt
put
water
therein.
040:008
And
thou
shalt
set
up
the
court
round
about,
and
hang
up
the
hanging
at
the
court
gate.
040:009
And
thou
shalt
take
the
anointing
oil,
and
anoint
the
tabernacle,
and
all
that
is
therein,
and
shalt
hallow
it,
and
all
the
vessels
thereof:
and
it
shall
be
holy.
040:010
And
thou
shalt
anoint
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering,
and
all
his
vessels,
and
sanctify
the
altar:
and
it
shall
be
an
altar
most
holy.
040:011
And
thou
shalt
anoint
the
laver
and
his
foot,
and
sanctify
it.
040:012
And
thou
shalt
bring
Aaron
and
his
sons
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
wash
them
with
water.
040:013
And
thou
shalt
put
upon
Aaron
the
holy
garments,
and
anoint
him,
and
sanctify
him;
that
he
may
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest's
office.
040:014
And
thou
shalt
bring
his
sons,
and
clothe
them
with
coats:
040:015
And
thou
shalt
anoint
them,
as
thou
didst
anoint
their
father,
that
they
may
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest's
office:
for
their
anointing
shall
surely
be
an
everlasting
priesthood
throughout
their
generations.
040:016
Thus
did
Moses:
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
commanded
him,
so
did
he.
040:017
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
first
month
in
the
second
year,
on
the
first
day
of
the
month,
that
the
tabernacle
was
reared
up.
040:018
And
Moses
reared
up
the
tabernacle,
and
fastened
his
sockets,
and
set
up
the
boards
thereof,
and
put
in
the
bars
thereof,
and
reared
up
his
pillars.
040:019
And
he
spread
abroad
the
tent
over
the
tabernacle,
and
put
the
covering
of
the
tent
above
upon
it;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
040:020
And
he
took
and
put
the
testimony
into
the
ark,
and
set
the
staves
on
the
ark,
and
put
the
mercy
seat
above
upon
the
ark:
040:021
And
he
brought
the
ark
into
the
tabernacle,
and
set
up
the
vail
of
the
covering,
and
covered
the
ark
of
the
testimony;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
040:022
And
he
put
the
table
in
the
tent
of
the
congregation,
upon
the
side
of
the
tabernacle
northward,
without
the
vail.
040:023
And
he
set
the
bread
in
order
upon
it
before
the
LORD;
as
the
LORD
had
commanded
Moses.
040:024
And
he
put
the
candlestick
in
the
tent
of
the
congregation,
over
against
the
table,
on
the
side
of
the
tabernacle
southward.
040:025
And
he
lighted
the
lamps
before
the
LORD;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
040:026
And
he
put
the
golden
altar
in
the
tent
of
the
congregation
before
the
vail:
040:027
And
he
burnt
sweet
incense
thereon;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
040:028
And
he
set
up
the
hanging
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle.
040:029
And
he
put
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
by
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
tent
of
the
congregation,
and
offered
upon
it
the
burnt
offering
and
the
meat
offering;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
040:030
And
he
set
the
laver
between
the
tent
of
the
congregation
and
the
altar,
and
put
water
there,
to
wash
withal.
040:031
And
Moses
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
washed
their
hands
and
their
feet
thereat:
040:032
When
they
went
into
