stars;
and
upon
the
earth
distress
of
nations,
with
perplexity;
the
sea
and
the
waves
roaring;
021:026
Men's
hearts
failing
them
for
fear,
and
for
looking
after
those
things
which
are
coming
on
the
earth:
for
the
powers
of
heaven
shall
be
shaken.
021:027
And
then
shall
they
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
a
cloud
with
power
and
great
glory.
021:028
And
when
these
things
begin
to
come
to
pass,
then
look
up,
and
lift
up
your
heads;
for
your
redemption
draweth
nigh.
021:029
And
he
spake
to
them
a
parable;
Behold
the
fig
tree,
and
all
the
trees;
021:030
When
they
now
shoot
forth,
ye
see
and
know
of
your
own
selves
that
summer
is
now
nigh
at
hand.
021:031
So
likewise
ye,
when
ye
see
these
things
come
to
pass,
know
ye
that
the
kingdom
of
God
is
nigh
at
hand.
021:032
Verily
I
say
unto
you,
This
generation
shall
not
pass
away,
till
all
be
fulfilled.
021:033
Heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away:
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
away.
021:034
And
take
heed
to
yourselves,
lest
at
any
time
your
hearts
be
overcharged
with
surfeiting,
and
drunkenness,
and
cares
of
this
life,
and
so
that
day
come
upon
you
unawares.
021:035
For
as
a
snare
shall
it
come
on
all
them
that
dwell
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth.
021:036
Watch
ye
therefore,
and
pray
always,
that
ye
may
be
accounted
worthy
to
escape
all
these
things
that
shall
come
to
pass,
and
to
stand
before
the
Son
of
man.
021:037
And
in
the
day
time
he
was
teaching
in
the
temple;
and
at
night
he
went
out,
and
abode
in
the
mount
that
is
called
the
mount
of
Olives.
021:038
And
all
the
people
came
early
in
the
morning
to
him
in
the
temple,
for
to
hear
him.
022:001
Now
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
drew
nigh,
which
is
called
the
Passover.
022:002
And
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
sought
how
they
might
kill
him;
for
they
feared
the
people.
022:003
Then
entered
Satan
into
Judas
surnamed
Iscariot,
being
of
the
number
of
the
twelve.
022:004
And
he
went
his
way,
and
communed
with
the
chief
priests
and
captains,
how
he
might
betray
him
unto
them.
022:005
And
they
were
glad,
and
covenanted
to
give
him
money.
022:006
And
he
promised,
and
sought
opportunity
to
betray
him
unto
them
in
the
absence
of
the
multitude.
022:007
Then
came
the
day
of
unleavened
bread,
when
the
passover
must
be
killed.
022:008
And
he
sent
Peter
and
John,
saying,
Go
and
prepare
us
the
passover,
that
we
may
eat.
022:009
And
they
said
unto
him,
Where
wilt
thou
that
we
prepare?
022:010
And
he
said
unto
them,
Behold,
when
ye
are
entered
into
the
city,
there
shall
a
man
meet
you,
bearing
a
pitcher
of
water;
follow
him
into
the
house
where
he
entereth
in.
022:011
And
ye
shall
say
unto
the
goodman
of
the
house,
The
Master
saith
unto
thee,
Where
is
the
guestchamber,
where
I
shall
eat
the
passover
with
my
disciples?
022:012
And
he
shall
shew
you
a
large
upper
room
furnished:
there
make
ready.
022:013
And
they
went,
and
found
as
he
had
said
unto
them:
and
they
made
ready
the
passover.
022:014
And
when
the
hour
was
come,
he
sat
down,
and
the
twelve
apostles
with
him.
022:015
And
he
said
unto
them,
With
desire
I
have
desired
to
eat
this
passover
with
you
before
I
suffer:
022:016
For
I
say
unto
you,
I
will
not
any
more
eat
thereof,
until
it
be
fulfilled
in
the
kingdom
of
God.
022:017
And
he
took
the
cup,
and
gave
thanks,
and
said,
Take
this,
and
divide
it
among
yourselves:
022:018
For
I
say
unto
you,
I
will
not
drink
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine,
until
the
kingdom
of
God
shall
come.
022:019
And
he
took
bread,
and
gave
thanks,
and
brake
it,
and
gave
unto
them,
saying,
This
is
my
body
which
is
given
for
you:
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me.
022:020
Likewise
also
the
cup
after
supper,
saying,
This
cup
is
the
new
testament
in
my
blood,
which
is
shed
for
you.
022:021
But,
behold,
the
hand
of
him
that
betrayeth
me
is
with
me
on
the
table.
022:022
And
truly
the
Son
of
man
goeth,
as
it
was
determined:
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
he
is
betrayed!
022:023
And
they
began
to
enquire
among
themselves,
which
of
them
it
was
that
should
do
this
thing.
022:024
And
there
was
also
a
strife
among
them,
which
of
them
should
be
accounted
the
greatest.
022:025
And
he
said
unto
them,
The
kings
of
the
Gentiles
exercise
lordship
over
them;
and
they
that
exercise
authority
upon
them
are
called
benefactors.
022:026
But
ye
shall
not
be
so:
but
he
that
is
greatest
among
you,
let
him
be
as
the
younger;
and
he
that
is
chief,
as
he
that
doth
serve.
022:027
For
whether
is
greater,
he
that
sitteth
at
meat,
or
he
that
serveth?
is
not
he
that
sitteth
at
meat?
but
I
am
among
you
as
he
that
serveth.
022:028
Ye
are
they
which
have
continued
with
me
in
my
temptations.
022:029
And
I
appoint
unto
you
a
kingdom,
as
my
Father
hath
appointed
unto
me;
022:030
That
ye
may
eat
and
drink
at
my
table
in
my
kingdom,
and
sit
on
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
Israel.
022:031
And
the
Lord
said,
Simon,
Simon,
behold,
Satan
hath
desired
to
have
you,
that
he
may
sift
you
as
wheat:
022:032
But
I
have
prayed
for
thee,
that
thy
faith
fail
not:
and
when
thou
art
converted,
strengthen
thy
brethren.
022:033
And
he
said
unto
him,
Lord,
I
am
ready
to
go
with
thee,
both
into
prison,
and
to
death.
022:034
And
he
said,
I
tell
thee,
Peter,
the
cock
shall
not
crow
this
day,
before
that
thou
shalt
thrice
deny
that
thou
knowest
me.
022:035
And
he
said
unto
them,
When
I
sent
you
without
purse,
and
scrip,
and
shoes,
lacked
ye
any
thing?
And
they
said,
Nothing.
022:036
Then
said
he
unto
them,
But
now,
he
that
hath
a
purse,
let
him
take
it,
and
likewise
his
scrip:
and
he
that
hath
no
sword,
let
him
sell
his
garment,
and
buy
one.
022:037
For
I
say
unto
you,
that
this
that
is
written
must
yet
be
accomplished
in
me,
And
he
was
reckoned
among
the
transgressors:
for
the
things
concerning
me
have
an
end.
022:038
And
they
said,
Lord,
behold,
here
are
two
swords.
And
he
said
unto
them,
It
is
enough.
022:039
And
he
came
out,
and
went,
as
he
was
wont,
to
the
mount
of
Olives;
and
his
disciples
also
followed
him.
022:040
And
when
he
was
at
the
place,
he
said
unto
them,
Pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation.
022:041
And
he
was
withdrawn
from
them
about
a
stone's
cast,
and
kneeled
down,
and
prayed,
022:042
Saying,
Father,
if
thou
be
willing,
remove
this
cup
from
me:
nevertheless
not
my
will,
but
thine,
be
done.
022:043
And
there
appeared
an
angel
unto
him
from
heaven,
strengthening
him.
022:044
And
being
in
an
agony
he
prayed
more
earnestly:
and
his
sweat
was
as
it
were
great
drops
of
blood
falling
down
to
the
ground.
022:045
And
when
he
rose
up
from
prayer,
and
was
come
to
his
disciples,
he
found
them
sleeping
for
sorrow,
022:046
And
said
unto
them,
Why
sleep
ye?
rise
and
pray,
lest
ye
enter
into
temptation.
022:047
And
while
he
yet
spake,
behold
a
multitude,
and
he
that
was
called
Judas,
one
of
the
twelve,
went
before
them,
and
drew
near
unto
Jesus
to
kiss
him.
022:048
But
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Judas,
betrayest
thou
the
Son
of
man
with
a
kiss?
022:049
When
they
which
were
about
him
saw
what
would
follow,
they
said
unto
him,
Lord,
shall
we
smite
with
the
sword?
022:050
And
one
of
them
smote
the
servant
of
the
high
priest,
and
cut
off
his
right
ear.
022:051
And
Jesus
answered
and
said,
Suffer
ye
thus
far.
And
he
touched
his
ear,
and
healed
him.
022:052
Then
Jesus
said
unto
the
chief
priests,
and
captains
of
the
temple,
and
the
elders,
which
were
come
to
him,
Be
ye
come
out,
as
against
a
thief,
with
swords
and
staves?
022:053
When
I
was
daily
with
you
in
the
temple,
ye
stretched
forth
no
hands
against
me:
but
this
is
your
hour,
and
the
power
of
darkness.
022:054
Then
took
they
him,
and
led
him,
and
brought
him
into
the
high
priest's
house.
And
Peter
followed
afar
off.
022:055
And
when
they
had
kindled
a
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
hall,
and
were
set
down
together,
Peter
sat
down
among
them.
022:056
But
a
certain
maid
beheld
him
as
he
sat
by
the
fire,
and
earnestly
looked
upon
him,
and
said,
This
man
was
also
with
him.
022:057
And
he
denied
him,
saying,
Woman,
I
know
him
not.
022:058
And
after
a
little
while
another
saw
him,
and
said,
Thou
art
also
of
them.
And
Peter
said,
Man,
I
am
not.
022:059
And
about
the
space
of
one
hour
after
another
confidently
affirmed,
saying,
Of
a
truth
this
fellow
also
was
with
him:
for
he
is
a
Galilaean.
022:060
And
Peter
said,
Man,
I
know
not
what
thou
sayest.
And
immediately,
while
he
yet
spake,
the
cock
crew.
022:061
And
the
Lord
turned,
and
looked
upon
Peter.
And
Peter
remembered
the
word
of
the
Lord,
how
he
had
said
unto
him,
Before
the
cock
crow,
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice.
022:062
And
Peter
went
out,
and
wept
bitterly.
022:063
And
the
men
that
held
Jesus
mocked
him,
and
smote
him.
022:064
And
when
they
had
blindfolded
him,
they
struck
him
on
the
face,
and
asked
him,
saying,
Prophesy,
who
is
it
that
smote
thee?
022:065
And
many
other
things
blasphemously
spake
they
against
him.
022:066
And
as
soon
as
it
was
day,
the
elders
of
the
people
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
came
together,
and
led
him
into
their
council,
saying,
022:067
Art
thou
the
Christ?
tell
us.
And
he
said
unto
them,
If
I
tell
you,
ye
will
not
believe:
022:068
And
if
I
also
ask
you,
ye
will
not
answer
me,
nor
let
me
go.
022:069
Hereafter
shall
the
Son
of
man
sit
on
the
right
hand
of
the
power
of
God.
022:070
Then
said
they
all,
Art
thou
then
the
Son
of
God?
And
he
said
unto
them,
Ye
say
that
I
am.
022:071
And
they
said,
What
need
we
any
further
witness?
for
we
ourselves
have
heard
of
his
own
mouth.
023:001
And
the
whole
multitude
of
them
arose,
and
led
him
unto
Pilate.
023:002
And
they
began
to
accuse
him,
saying,
We
found
this
fellow
perverting
the
nation,
and
forbidding
to
give
tribute
to
Caesar,
saying
that
he
himself
is
Christ
a
King.
023:003
And
Pilate
asked
him,
saying,
Art
thou
the
King
of
the
Jews?
And
he
answered
him
and
said,
Thou
sayest
it.
023:004
Then
said
Pilate
to
the
chief
priests
and
to
the
people,
I
find
no
fault
in
this
man.
023:005
And
they
were
the
more
fierce,
saying,
He
stirreth
up
the
people,
teaching
throughout
all
Jewry,
beginning
from
Galilee
to
this
place.
023:006
When
Pilate
heard
of
Galilee,
he
asked
whether
the
man
were
a
Galilaean.
023:007
And
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
he
belonged
unto
Herod's
jurisdiction,
he
sent
him
to
Herod,
who
himself
also
was
at
Jerusalem
at
that
time.
023:008
And
when
Herod
saw
Jesus,
he
was
exceeding
glad:
for
he
was
desirous
to
see
him
of
a
long
season,
because
he
had
heard
many
things
of
him;
and
he
hoped
to
have
seen
some
miracle
done
by
him.
023:009
Then
he
questioned
with
him
in
many
words;
but
he
answered
him
nothing.
023:010
And
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
stood
and
vehemently
accused
him.
023:011
And
Herod
with
his
men
of
war
set
him
at
nought,
and
mocked
him,
and
arrayed
him
in
a
gorgeous
robe,
and
sent
him
again
to
Pilate.
023:012
And
the
same
day
Pilate
and
Herod
were
made
friends
together:
for
before
they
were
at
enmity
between
themselves.
023:013
And
Pilate,
when
he
had
called
together
the
chief
priests
and
the
rulers
and
the
people,
023:014
Said
unto
them,
Ye
have
brought
this
man
unto
me,
as
one
that
perverteth
the
people:
and,
behold,
I,
having
examined
him
before
you,
have
found
no
fault
in
this
man
touching
those
things
whereof
ye
accuse
him:
023:015
No,
nor
yet
Herod:
for
I
sent
you
to
him;
and,
lo,
nothing
worthy
of
death
is
done
unto
him.
023:016
I
will
therefore
chastise
him,
and
release
him.
023:017
(For
of
necessity
he
must
release
one
unto
them
at
the
feast.)
023:018
And
they
cried
out
all
at
once,
saying,
Away
with
this
man,
and
release
unto
us
Barabbas:
023:019
(Who
for
a
certain
sedition
made
in
the
city,
and
for
murder,
was
cast
into
prison.)
023:020
Pilate
therefore,
willing
to
release
Jesus,
spake
again
to
them.
023:021
But
they
cried,
saying,
Crucify
him,
crucify
him.
023:022
And
he
said
unto
them
the
third
time,
Why,
what
evil
hath
he
done?
I
have
found
no
cause
of
death
in
him:
I
will
therefore
chastise
him,
and
let
him
go.
023:023
And
they
were
instant
with
loud
voices,
requiring
that
he
might
be
crucified.
And
the
voices
of
them
and
of
the
chief
priests
prevailed.
023:024
And
Pilate
gave
sentence
that
it
should
be
as
they
required.
023:025
And
he
released
unto
them
him
that
for
sedition
and
murder
was
cast
into
prison,
whom
they
had
desired;
but
he
delivered
Jesus
to
their
will.
023:026
And
as
they
led
him
away,
they
laid
hold
upon
one
Simon,
a
Cyrenian,
coming
out
of
the
country,
and
on
him
they
laid
the
cross,
that
he
might
bear
it
after
Jesus.
023:027
And
there
followed
him
a
great
company
of
people,
and
of
women,
which
also
bewailed
and
lamented
him.
023:028
But
Jesus
turning
unto
them
said,
Daughters
of
Jerusalem,
weep
not
for
me,
but
weep
for
yourselves,
and
for
your
children.
023:029
For,
behold,
the
days
are
coming,
in
the
which
they
shall
say,
Blessed
are
the
barren,
and
the
wombs
that
never
bare,
and
the
paps
which
never
gave
suck.
023:030
Then
shall
they
begin
to
say
to
the
mountains,
Fall
on
us;
and
to
the
hills,
Cover
us.
023:031
For
if
they
do
these
things
in
a
green
tree,
what
shall
be
done
in
the
dry?
023:032
And
there
were
also
two
other,
malefactors,
led
with
him
to
be
put
to
death.
023:033
And
when
they
were
come
to
the
place,
which
is
called
Calvary,
there
they
crucified
him,
and
the
malefactors,
one
on
the
right
hand,
and
the
other
on
the
left.
023:034
Then
said
Jesus,
Father,
forgive
them;
for
they
know
not
what
they
do.
And
they
parted
his
raiment,
and
cast
lots.
023:035
And
the
people
stood
beholding.
And
the
rulers
also
with
them
derided
him,
saying,
He
saved
others;
let
him
save
himself,
if
he
be
Christ,
the
chosen
of
God.
023:036
And
the
soldiers
also
mocked
him,
coming
to
him,
and
offering
him
vinegar,
023:037
And
saying,
If
thou
be
the
king
of
the
Jews,
save
thyself.
023:038
And
a
superscription
also
was
written
over
him
in
letters
of
Greek,
and
Latin,
and
Hebrew,
THIS
IS
THE
KING
OF
THE
JEWS.
023:039
And
one
of
the
malefactors
which
were
hanged
railed
on
him,
saying,
If
thou
be
Christ,
save
thyself
and
us.
023:040
But
the
other
answering
rebuked
him,
saying,
Dost
not
thou
fear
God,
seeing
thou
art
in
the
same
condemnation?
023:041
And
we
indeed
justly;
for
we
receive
the
due
reward
of
our
deeds:
but
this
man
hath
done
nothing
amiss.
023:042
And
he
said
unto
Jesus,
Lord,
remember
me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
kingdom.
023:043
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Verily
I
say
unto
thee,
To
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise.
023:044
And
it
was
about
the
sixth
hour,
and
there
was
a
darkness
over
all
the
earth
until
the
ninth
hour.
023:045
And
the
sun
was
darkened,
and
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
the
midst.
023:046
And
when
Jesus
had
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
he
said,
Father,
into
thy
hands
I
commend
my
spirit:
and
having
said
thus,
he
gave
up
the
ghost.
023:047
Now
when
the
centurion
saw
what
was
done,
he
glorified
God,
saying,
Certainly
this
was
a
righteous
man.
023:048
And
all
the
people
that
came
together
to
that
sight,
beholding
the
things
which
were
done,
smote
their
breasts,
and
returned.
023:049
And
all
his
acquaintance,
and
the
women
that
followed
him
from
Galilee,
stood
afar
off,
beholding
these
things.
023:050
And,
behold,
there
was
a
man
named
Joseph,
a
counsellor;
and
he
was
a
good
man,
and
a
just:
023:051
(The
same
had
not
consented
to
the
counsel
and
deed
of
them;)
he
was
of
Arimathaea,
a
city
of
the
Jews:
who
also
himself
waited
for
the
kingdom
of
God.
023:052
This
man
went
unto
Pilate,
and
begged
the
body
of
Jesus.
023:053
And
he
took
it
down,
and
wrapped
it
in
linen,
and
laid
it
in
a
sepulchre
that
was
hewn
in
stone,
wherein
never
man
before
was
laid.
023:054
And
that
day
was
the
preparation,
and
the
sabbath
drew
on.
023:055
And
the
women
also,
which
came
with
him
from
Galilee,
followed
after,
and
beheld
the
sepulchre,
and
how
his
body
was
laid.
023:056
And
they
returned,
and
prepared
spices
and
ointments;
and
rested
the
sabbath
day
according
to
the
commandment.
024:001
Now
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week,
very
early
in
the
morning,
they
came
unto
the
sepulchre,
bringing
the
spices
which
they
had
prepared,
and
certain
others
with
them.
024:002
And
they
found
the
stone
rolled
away
from
the
sepulchre.
024:003
And
they
entered
in,
and
found
not
the
body
of
the
Lord
Jesus.
024:004
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
were
much
perplexed
thereabout,
behold,
two
men
stood
by
them
in
shining
garments:
024:005
And
as
they
were
afraid,
and
bowed
down
their
faces
to
the
earth,
they
said
unto
them,
Why
seek
ye
the
living
among
the
dead?
024:006
He
is
not
here,
but
is
risen:
remember
how
he
spake
unto
you
when
he
was
yet
in
Galilee,
024:007
Saying,
The
Son
of
man
must
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
sinful
men,
and
be
crucified,
and
the
third
day
rise
again.
024:008
And
they
remembered
his
words,
024:009
And
returned
from
the
sepulchre,
and
told
all
these
things
unto
the
eleven,
and
to
all
the
rest.
024:010
It
was
Mary
Magdalene
and
Joanna,
and
Mary
the
mother
of
James,
and
other
women
that
were
with
them,
which
told
these
things
unto
the
apostles.
024:011
And
their
words
seemed
to
them
as
idle
tales,
and
they
believed
them
not.
024:012
Then
arose
Peter,
and
ran
unto
the
sepulchre;
and
stooping
down,
he
beheld
the
linen
clothes
laid
by
themselves,
and
departed,
wondering
in
himself
at
that
which
was
come
to
pass.
024:013
And,
behold,
two
of
them
went
that
same
day
to
a
village
called
Emmaus,
which
was
from
Jerusalem
about
threescore
furlongs.
024:014
And
they
talked
together
of
all
these
things
which
had
happened.
024:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
while
they
communed
together
and
reasoned,
Jesus
himself
drew
near,
and
went
with
them.
024:016
But
their
eyes
were
holden
that
they
should
not
know
him.
024:017
And
he
said
unto
them,
What
manner
of
communications
are
these
that
ye
have
one
to
another,
as
ye
walk,
and
are
sad?
024:018
And
the
one
of
them,
whose
name
was
Cleopas,
answering
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
only
a
stranger
in
Jerusalem,
and
hast
not
known
the
things
which
are
come
to
pass
there
in
these
days?
024:019
And
he
said
unto
them,
What
things?
And
they
said
unto
him,
Concerning
Jesus
of
Nazareth,
which
was
a
prophet
mighty
in
deed
and
word
before
God
and
all
the
people:
024:020
And
how
the
chief
priests
and
our
rulers
delivered
him
to
be
condemned
to
death,
and
have
crucified
him.
024:021
But
we
trusted
that
it
had
been
he
which
should
have
redeemed
Israel:
and
beside
all
this,
to
day
is
the
third
day
since
these
things
were
done.
024:022
Yea,
and
certain
women
also
of
our
company
made
us
astonished,
which
were
early
at
the
sepulchre;
024:023
And
when
they
found
not
his
body,
they
came,
saying,
that
they
had
also
seen
a
vision
of
angels,
which
said
that
he
was
alive.
024:024
And
certain
of
them
which
were
with
us
went
to
the
sepulchre,
and
found
it
even
so
as
the
women
had
said:
but
him
they
saw
not.
024:025
Then
he
said
unto
them,
O
fools,
and
slow
of
heart
to
believe
all
that
the
prophets
have
spoken:
024:026
Ought
not
Christ
to
have
suffered
these
things,
and
to
enter
into
his
glory?
024:027
And
beginning
at
Moses
and
all
the
prophets,
he
expounded
unto
them
in
all
the
scriptures
the
things
concerning
himself.
024:028
And
they
drew
nigh
unto
the
village,
whither
they
went:
and
he
made
as
though
he
would
have
gone
further.
024:029
But
they
constrained
him,
saying,
Abide
with
us:
for
it
is
toward
evening,
and
the
day
is
far
spent.
And
he
went
in
to
tarry
with
them.
024:030
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
sat
at
meat
with
them,
he
took
bread,
and
blessed
it,
and
brake,
and
gave
to
them.
024:031
And
their
eyes
were
opened,
and
they
knew
him;
and
he
vanished
out
of
their
sight.
024:032
And
they
said
one
to
another,
Did
not
our
heart
burn
within
us,
while
he
talked
with
us
by
the
way,
and
while
he
opened
to
us
the
scriptures?
024:033
And
they
rose
up
the
same
hour,
and
returned
to
Jerusalem,
and
found
the
eleven
gathered
together,
and
them
that
were
with
them,
024:034
Saying,
The
Lord
is
risen
indeed,
and
hath
appeared
to
Simon.
024:035
And
they
told
what
things
were
done
in
the
way,
and
how
he
was
known
of
them
in
breaking
of
bread.
024:036
And
as
they
thus
spake,
Jesus
himself
stood
in
the
midst
of
them,
and
saith
unto
them,
Peace
be
unto
you.
024:037
But
they
were
terrified
and
affrighted,
and
supposed
that
they
had
seen
a
spirit.
024:038
And
he
said
unto
them,
Why
are
ye
troubled?
and
why
do
thoughts
arise
in
your
hearts?
024:039
Behold
my
hands
and
my
feet,
that
it
is
I
myself:
handle
me,
and
see;
for
a
spirit
hath
not
flesh
and
bones,
as
ye
see
me
have.
024:040
And
when
he
had
thus
spoken,
he
shewed
them
his
hands
and
his
feet.
024:041
And
while
they
yet
believed
not
for
joy,
and
wondered,
he
said
unto
them,
Have
ye
here
any
meat?
024:042
And
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
a
broiled
fish,
and
of
an
honeycomb.
024:043
And
he
took
it,
and
did
eat
before
them.
024:044
And
he
said
unto
them,
These
are
the
words
which
I
spake
unto
you,
while
I
was
yet
with
you,
that
all
things
must
be
fulfilled,
which
were
written
in
the
law
of
Moses,
and
in
the
prophets,
and
in
the
psalms,
concerning
me.
024:045
Then
opened
he
their
understanding,
that
they
might
understand
the
scriptures,
024:046
And
said
unto
them,
Thus
it
is
written,
and
thus
it
behoved
Christ
to
suffer,
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
the
third
day:
024:047
And
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
should
be
preached
in
his
name
among
all
nations,
beginning
at
Jerusalem.
024:048
And
ye
are
witnesses
of
these
things.
024:049
And,
behold,
I
send
the
promise
of
my
Father
upon
you:
but
tarry
ye
in
the
city
of
Jerusalem,
until
ye
be
endued
with
power
from
on
high.
024:050
And
he
led
them
out
as
far
as
to
Bethany,
and
he
lifted
up
his
hands,
and
blessed
them.
024:051
And
it
came
to
pass,
while
he
blessed
them,
he
was
parted
from
them,
and
carried
up
into
heaven.
024:052
And
they
worshipped
him,
and
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
great
joy:
024:053
And
were
continually
in
the
temple,
praising
and
blessing
God.
Amen.
Book
43	John
001:001
In
the
beginning
was
the
Word,
and
the
Word
was
with
God,
and
the
Word
was
God.
001:002
The
same
was
in
the
beginning
with
God.
001:003
All
things
were
made
by
him;
and
without
him
was
not
any
