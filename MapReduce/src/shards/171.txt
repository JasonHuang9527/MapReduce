thing
made
that
was
made.
001:004
In
him
was
life;
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men.
001:005
And
the
light
shineth
in
darkness;
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
not.
001:006
There
was
a
man
sent
from
God,
whose
name
was
John.
001:007
The
same
came
for
a
witness,
to
bear
witness
of
the
Light,
that
all
men
through
him
might
believe.
001:008
He
was
not
that
Light,
but
was
sent
to
bear
witness
of
that
Light.
001:009
That
was
the
true
Light,
which
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world.
001:010
He
was
in
the
world,
and
the
world
was
made
by
him,
and
the
world
knew
him
not.
001:011
He
came
unto
his
own,
and
his
own
received
him
not.
001:012
But
as
many
as
received
him,
to
them
gave
he
power
to
become
the
sons
of
God,
even
to
them
that
believe
on
his
name:
001:013
Which
were
born,
not
of
blood,
nor
of
the
will
of
the
flesh,
nor
of
the
will
of
man,
but
of
God.
001:014
And
the
Word
was
made
flesh,
and
dwelt
among
us,
(and
we
beheld
his
glory,
the
glory
as
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
Father,)
full
of
grace
and
truth.
001:015
John
bare
witness
of
him,
and
cried,
saying,
This
was
he
of
whom
I
spake,
He
that
cometh
after
me
is
preferred
before
me:
for
he
was
before
me.
001:016
And
of
his
fulness
have
all
we
received,
and
grace
for
grace.
001:017
For
the
law
was
given
by
Moses,
but
grace
and
truth
came
by
Jesus
Christ.
001:018
No
man
hath
seen
God
at
any
time,
the
only
begotten
Son,
which
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
Father,
he
hath
declared
him.
001:019
And
this
is
the
record
of
John,
when
the
Jews
sent
priests
and
Levites
from
Jerusalem
to
ask
him,
Who
art
thou?
001:020
And
he
confessed,
and
denied
not;
but
confessed,
I
am
not
the
Christ.
001:021
And
they
asked
him,
What
then?
Art
thou
Elias?
And
he
saith,
I
am
not.
Art
thou
that
prophet?
And
he
answered,
No.
001:022
Then
said
they
unto
him,
Who
art
thou?
that
we
may
give
an
answer
to
them
that
sent
us.
What
sayest
thou
of
thyself?
001:023
He
said,
I
am
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness,
Make
straight
the
way
of
the
Lord,
as
said
the
prophet
Esaias.
001:024
And
they
which
were
sent
were
of
the
Pharisees.
001:025
And
they
asked
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Why
baptizest
thou
then,
if
thou
be
not
that
Christ,
nor
Elias,
neither
that
prophet?
001:026
John
answered
them,
saying,
I
baptize
with
water:
but
there
standeth
one
among
you,
whom
ye
know
not;
001:027
He
it
is,
who
coming
after
me
is
preferred
before
me,
whose
shoe's
latchet
I
am
not
worthy
to
unloose.
001:028
These
things
were
done
in
Bethabara
beyond
Jordan,
where
John
was
baptizing.
001:029
The
next
day
John
seeth
Jesus
coming
unto
him,
and
saith,
Behold
the
Lamb
of
God,
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world.
001:030
This
is
he
of
whom
I
said,
After
me
cometh
a
man
which
is
preferred
before
me:
for
he
was
before
me.
001:031
And
I
knew
him
not:
but
that
he
should
be
made
manifest
to
Israel,
therefore
am
I
come
baptizing
with
water.
001:032
And
John
bare
record,
saying,
I
saw
the
Spirit
descending
from
heaven
like
a
dove,
and
it
abode
upon
him.
001:033
And
I
knew
him
not:
but
he
that
sent
me
to
baptize
with
water,
the
same
said
unto
me,
Upon
whom
thou
shalt
see
the
Spirit
descending,
and
remaining
on
him,
the
same
is
he
which
baptizeth
with
the
Holy
Ghost.
001:034
And
I
saw,
and
bare
record
that
this
is
the
Son
of
God.
001:035
Again
the
next
day
after
John
stood,
and
two
of
his
disciples;
001:036
And
looking
upon
Jesus
as
he
walked,
he
saith,
Behold
the
Lamb
of
God!
001:037
And
the
two
disciples
heard
him
speak,
and
they
followed
Jesus.
001:038
Then
Jesus
turned,
and
saw
them
following,
and
saith
unto
them,
What
seek
ye?
They
said
unto
him,
Rabbi,
(which
is
to
say,
being
interpreted,
Master,)
where
dwellest
thou?
001:039
He
saith
unto
them,
Come
and
see.
They
came
and
saw
where
he
dwelt,
and
abode
with
him
that
day:
for
it
was
about
the
tenth
hour.
001:040
One
of
the
two
which
heard
John
speak,
and
followed
him,
was
Andrew,
Simon
Peter's
brother.
001:041
He
first
findeth
his
own
brother
Simon,
and
saith
unto
him,
We
have
found
the
Messias,
which
is,
being
interpreted,
the
Christ.
001:042
And
he
brought
him
to
Jesus.
And
when
Jesus
beheld
him,
he
said,
Thou
art
Simon
the
son
of
Jona:
thou
shalt
be
called
Cephas,
which
is
by
interpretation,
A
stone.
001:043
The
day
following
Jesus
would
go
forth
into
Galilee,
and
findeth
Philip,
and
saith
unto
him,
Follow
me.
001:044
Now
Philip
was
of
Bethsaida,
the
city
of
Andrew
and
Peter.
001:045
Philip
findeth
Nathanael,
and
saith
unto
him,
We
have
found
him,
of
whom
Moses
in
the
law,
and
the
prophets,
did
write,
Jesus
of
Nazareth,
the
son
of
Joseph.
001:046
And
Nathanael
said
unto
him,
Can
there
any
good
thing
come
out
of
Nazareth?
Philip
saith
unto
him,
Come
and
see.
001:047
Jesus
saw
Nathanael
coming
to
him,
and
saith
of
him,
Behold
an
Israelite
indeed,
in
whom
is
no
guile!
001:048
Nathanael
saith
unto
him,
Whence
knowest
thou
me?
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Before
that
Philip
called
thee,
when
thou
wast
under
the
fig
tree,
I
saw
thee.
001:049
Nathanael
answered
and
saith
unto
him,
Rabbi,
thou
art
the
Son
of
God;
thou
art
the
King
of
Israel.
001:050
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Because
I
said
unto
thee,
I
saw
thee
under
the
fig
tree,
believest
thou?
thou
shalt
see
greater
things
than
these.
001:051
And
he
saith
unto
him,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
Hereafter
ye
shall
see
heaven
open,
and
the
angels
of
God
ascending
and
descending
upon
the
Son
of
man.
002:001
And
the
third
day
there
was
a
marriage
in
Cana
of
Galilee;
and
the
mother
of
Jesus
was
there:
002:002
And
both
Jesus
was
called,
and
his
disciples,
to
the
marriage.
002:003
And
when
they
wanted
wine,
the
mother
of
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
They
have
no
wine.
002:004
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Woman,
what
have
I
to
do
with
thee?
mine
hour
is
not
yet
come.
002:005
His
mother
saith
unto
the
servants,
Whatsoever
he
saith
unto
you,
do
it.
002:006
And
there
were
set
there
six
waterpots
of
stone,
after
the
manner
of
the
purifying
of
the
Jews,
containing
two
or
three
firkins
apiece.
002:007
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Fill
the
waterpots
with
water.
And
they
filled
them
up
to
the
brim.
002:008
And
he
saith
unto
them,
Draw
out
now,
and
bear
unto
the
governor
of
the
feast.
And
they
bare
it.
002:009
When
the
ruler
of
the
feast
had
tasted
the
water
that
was
made
wine,
and
knew
not
whence
it
was:
(but
the
servants
which
drew
the
water
knew;)
the
governor
of
the
feast
called
the
bridegroom,
002:010
And
saith
unto
him,
Every
man
at
the
beginning
doth
set
forth
good
wine;
and
when
men
have
well
drunk,
then
that
which
is
worse:
but
thou
hast
kept
the
good
wine
until
now.
002:011
This
beginning
of
miracles
did
Jesus
in
Cana
of
Galilee,
and
manifested
forth
his
glory;
and
his
disciples
believed
on
him.
002:012
After
this
he
went
down
to
Capernaum,
he,
and
his
mother,
and
his
brethren,
and
his
disciples:
and
they
continued
there
not
many
days.
002:013
And
the
Jews'
passover
was
at
hand,
and
Jesus
went
up
to
Jerusalem.
002:014
And
found
in
the
temple
those
that
sold
oxen
and
sheep
and
doves,
and
the
changers
of
money
sitting:
002:015
And
when
he
had
made
a
scourge
of
small
cords,
he
drove
them
all
out
of
the
temple,
and
the
sheep,
and
the
oxen;
and
poured
out
the
changers'
money,
and
overthrew
the
tables;
002:016
And
said
unto
them
that
sold
doves,
Take
these
things
hence;
make
not
my
Father's
house
an
house
of
merchandise.
002:017
And
his
disciples
remembered
that
it
was
written,
The
zeal
of
thine
house
hath
eaten
me
up.
002:018
Then
answered
the
Jews
and
said
unto
him,
What
sign
shewest
thou
unto
us,
seeing
that
thou
doest
these
things?
002:019
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Destroy
this
temple,
and
in
three
days
I
will
raise
it
up.
002:020
Then
said
the
Jews,
Forty
and
six
years
was
this
temple
in
building,
and
wilt
thou
rear
it
up
in
three
days?
002:021
But
he
spake
of
the
temple
of
his
body.
002:022
When
therefore
he
was
risen
from
the
dead,
his
disciples
remembered
that
he
had
said
this
unto
them;
and
they
believed
the
scripture,
and
the
word
which
Jesus
had
said.
002:023
Now
when
he
was
in
Jerusalem
at
the
passover,
in
the
feast
day,
many
believed
in
his
name,
when
they
saw
the
miracles
which
he
did.
002:024
But
Jesus
did
not
commit
himself
unto
them,
because
he
knew
all
men,
002:025
And
needed
not
that
any
should
testify
of
man:
for
he
knew
what
was
in
man.
003:001
There
was
a
man
of
the
Pharisees,
named
Nicodemus,
a
ruler
of
the
Jews:
003:002
The
same
came
to
Jesus
by
night,
and
said
unto
him,
Rabbi,
we
know
that
thou
art
a
teacher
come
from
God:
for
no
man
can
do
these
miracles
that
thou
doest,
except
God
be
with
him.
003:003
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
thee,
Except
a
man
be
born
again,
he
cannot
see
the
kingdom
of
God.
003:004
Nicodemus
saith
unto
him,
How
can
a
man
be
born
when
he
is
old?
can
he
enter
the
second
time
into
his
mother's
womb,
and
be
born?
003:005
Jesus
answered,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
thee,
Except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
Spirit,
he
cannot
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God.
003:006
That
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh;
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
Spirit
is
spirit.
003:007
Marvel
not
that
I
said
unto
thee,
Ye
must
be
born
again.
003:008
The
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth,
and
thou
hearest
the
sound
thereof,
but
canst
not
tell
whence
it
cometh,
and
whither
it
goeth:
so
is
every
one
that
is
born
of
the
Spirit.
003:009
Nicodemus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
How
can
these
things
be?
003:010
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
a
master
of
Israel,
and
knowest
not
these
things?
003:011
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
thee,
We
speak
that
we
do
know,
and
testify
that
we
have
seen;
and
ye
receive
not
our
witness.
003:012
If
I
have
told
you
earthly
things,
and
ye
believe
not,
how
shall
ye
believe,
if
I
tell
you
of
heavenly
things?
003:013
And
no
man
hath
ascended
up
to
heaven,
but
he
that
came
down
from
heaven,
even
the
Son
of
man
which
is
in
heaven.
003:014
And
as
Moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness,
even
so
must
the
Son
of
man
be
lifted
up:
003:015
That
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish,
but
have
eternal
life.
003:016
For
God
so
loved
the
world,
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
Son,
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish,
but
have
everlasting
life.
003:017
For
God
sent
not
his
Son
into
the
world
to
condemn
the
world;
but
that
the
world
through
him
might
be
saved.
003:018
He
that
believeth
on
him
is
not
condemned:
but
he
that
believeth
not
is
condemned
already,
because
he
hath
not
believed
in
the
name
of
the
only
begotten
Son
of
God.
003:019
And
this
is
the
condemnation,
that
light
is
come
into
the
world,
and
men
loved
darkness
rather
than
light,
because
their
deeds
were
evil.
003:020
For
every
one
that
doeth
evil
hateth
the
light,
neither
cometh
to
the
light,
lest
his
deeds
should
be
reproved.
003:021
But
he
that
doeth
truth
cometh
to
the
light,
that
his
deeds
may
be
made
manifest,
that
they
are
wrought
in
God.
003:022
After
these
things
came
Jesus
and
his
disciples
into
the
land
of
Judaea;
and
there
he
tarried
with
them,
and
baptized.
003:023
And
John
also
was
baptizing
in
Aenon
near
to
Salim,
because
there
was
much
water
there:
and
they
came,
and
were
baptized.
003:024
For
John
was
not
yet
cast
into
prison.
003:025
Then
there
arose
a
question
between
some
of
John's
disciples
and
the
Jews
about
purifying.
003:026
And
they
came
unto
John,
and
said
unto
him,
Rabbi,
he
that
was
with
thee
beyond
Jordan,
to
whom
thou
barest
witness,
behold,
the
same
baptizeth,
and
all
men
come
to
him.
003:027
John
answered
and
said,
A
man
can
receive
nothing,
except
it
be
given
him
from
heaven.
003:028
Ye
yourselves
bear
me
witness,
that
I
said,
I
am
not
the
Christ,
but
that
I
am
sent
before
him.
003:029
He
that
hath
the
bride
is
the
bridegroom:
but
the
friend
of
the
bridegroom,
which
standeth
and
heareth
him,
rejoiceth
greatly
because
of
the
bridegroom's
voice:
this
my
joy
therefore
is
fulfilled.
003:030
He
must
increase,
but
I
must
decrease.
003:031
He
that
cometh
from
above
is
above
all:
he
that
is
of
the
earth
is
earthly,
and
speaketh
of
the
earth:
he
that
cometh
from
heaven
is
above
all.
003:032
And
what
he
hath
seen
and
heard,
that
he
testifieth;
and
no
man
receiveth
his
testimony.
003:033
He
that
hath
received
his
testimony
hath
set
to
his
seal
that
God
is
true.
003:034
For
he
whom
God
hath
sent
speaketh
the
words
of
God:
for
God
giveth
not
the
Spirit
by
measure
unto
him.
003:035
The
Father
loveth
the
Son,
and
hath
given
all
things
into
his
hand.
003:036
He
that
believeth
on
the
Son
hath
everlasting
life:
and
he
that
believeth
not
the
Son
shall
not
see
life;
but
the
wrath
of
God
abideth
on
him.
004:001
When
therefore
the
LORD
knew
how
the
Pharisees
had
heard
that
Jesus
made
and
baptized
more
disciples
than
John,
004:002
(Though
Jesus
himself
baptized
not,
but
his
disciples,)
004:003
He
left
Judaea,
and
departed
again
into
Galilee.
004:004
And
he
must
needs
go
through
Samaria.
004:005
Then
cometh
he
to
a
city
of
Samaria,
which
is
called
Sychar,
near
to
the
parcel
of
ground
that
Jacob
gave
to
his
son
Joseph.
004:006
Now
Jacob's
well
was
there.
Jesus
therefore,
being
wearied
with
his
journey,
sat
thus
on
the
well:
and
it
was
about
the
sixth
hour.
004:007
There
cometh
a
woman
of
Samaria
to
draw
water:
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Give
me
to
drink.
004:008
(For
his
disciples
were
gone
away
unto
the
city
to
buy
meat.)
004:009
Then
saith
the
woman
of
Samaria
unto
him,
How
is
it
that
thou,
being
a
Jew,
askest
drink
of
me,
which
am
a
woman
of
Samaria?
for
the
Jews
have
no
dealings
with
the
Samaritans.
004:010
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her,
If
thou
knewest
the
gift
of
God,
and
who
it
is
that
saith
to
thee,
Give
me
to
drink;
thou
wouldest
have
asked
of
him,
and
he
would
have
given
thee
living
water.
004:011
The
woman
saith
unto
him,
Sir,
thou
hast
nothing
to
draw
with,
and
the
well
is
deep:
from
whence
then
hast
thou
that
living
water?
004:012
Art
thou
greater
than
our
father
Jacob,
which
gave
us
the
well,
and
drank
thereof
himself,
and
his
children,
and
his
cattle?
004:013
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her,
Whosoever
drinketh
of
this
water
shall
thirst
again:
004:014
But
whosoever
drinketh
of
the
water
that
I
shall
give
him
shall
never
thirst;
but
the
water
that
I
shall
give
him
shall
be
in
him
a
well
of
water
springing
up
into
everlasting
life.
004:015
The
woman
saith
unto
him,
Sir,
give
me
this
water,
that
I
thirst
not,
neither
come
hither
to
draw.
004:016
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Go,
call
thy
husband,
and
come
hither.
004:017
The
woman
answered
and
said,
I
have
no
husband.
Jesus
said
unto
her,
Thou
hast
well
said,
I
have
no
husband:
004:018
For
thou
hast
had
five
husbands;
and
he
whom
thou
now
hast
is
not
thy
husband:
in
that
saidst
thou
truly.
004:019
The
woman
saith
unto
him,
Sir,
I
perceive
that
thou
art
a
prophet.
004:020
Our
fathers
worshipped
in
this
mountain;
and
ye
say,
that
in
Jerusalem
is
the
place
where
men
ought
to
worship.
004:021
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Woman,
believe
me,
the
hour
cometh,
when
ye
shall
neither
in
this
mountain,
nor
yet
at
Jerusalem,
worship
the
Father.
004:022
Ye
worship
ye
know
not
what:
we
know
what
we
worship:
for
salvation
is
of
the
Jews.
004:023
But
the
hour
cometh,
and
now
is,
when
the
true
worshippers
shall
worship
the
Father
in
spirit
and
in
truth:
for
the
Father
seeketh
such
to
worship
him.
004:024
God
is
a
Spirit:
and
they
that
worship
him
must
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth.
004:025
The
woman
saith
unto
him,
I
know
that
Messias
cometh,
which
is
called
Christ:
when
he
is
come,
he
will
tell
us
all
things.
004:026
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
I
that
speak
unto
thee
am
he.
004:027
And
upon
this
came
his
disciples,
and
marvelled
that
he
talked
with
the
woman:
yet
no
man
said,
What
seekest
thou?
or,
Why
talkest
thou
with
her?
004:028
The
woman
then
left
her
waterpot,
and
went
her
way
into
the
city,
and
saith
to
the
men,
004:029
Come,
see
a
man,
which
told
me
all
things
that
ever
I
did:
is
not
this
the
Christ?
004:030
Then
they
went
out
of
the
city,
and
came
unto
him.
004:031
In
the
mean
while
his
disciples
prayed
him,
saying,
Master,
eat.
004:032
But
he
said
unto
them,
I
have
meat
to
eat
that
ye
know
not
of.
004:033
Therefore
said
the
disciples
one
to
another,
Hath
any
man
brought
him
ought
to
eat?
004:034
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
My
meat
is
to
do
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me,
and
to
finish
his
work.
004:035
Say
not
ye,
There
are
yet
four
months,
and
then
cometh
harvest?
behold,
I
say
unto
you,
Lift
up
your
eyes,
and
look
on
the
fields;
for
they
are
white
already
to
harvest.
004:036
And
he
that
reapeth
receiveth
wages,
and
gathereth
fruit
unto
life
eternal:
that
both
he
that
soweth
and
he
that
reapeth
may
rejoice
together.
004:037
And
herein
is
that
saying
true,
One
soweth,
and
another
reapeth.
004:038
I
sent
you
to
reap
that
whereon
ye
bestowed
no
labour:
other
men
laboured,
and
ye
are
entered
into
their
labours.
004:039
And
many
of
the
Samaritans
of
that
city
believed
on
him
for
the
saying
of
the
woman,
which
testified,
He
told
me
all
that
ever
I
did.
004:040
So
when
the
Samaritans
were
come
unto
him,
they
besought
him
that
he
would
tarry
with
them:
and
he
abode
there
two
days.
004:041
And
many
more
believed
because
of
his
own
word;
004:042
And
said
unto
the
woman,
Now
we
believe,
not
because
of
thy
saying:
for
we
have
heard
him
ourselves,
and
know
that
this
is
indeed
the
Christ,
the
Saviour
of
the
world.
004:043
Now
after
two
days
he
departed
thence,
and
went
into
Galilee.
004:044
For
Jesus
himself
testified,
that
a
prophet
hath
no
honour
in
his
own
country.
004:045
Then
when
he
was
come
into
Galilee,
the
Galilaeans
received
him,
having
seen
all
the
things
that
he
did
at
Jerusalem
at
the
feast:
for
they
also
went
unto
the
feast.
004:046
So
Jesus
came
again
into
Cana
of
Galilee,
where
he
made
the
water
wine.
And
there
was
a
certain
nobleman,
whose
son
was
sick
at
Capernaum.
004:047
When
he
heard
that
Jesus
was
come
out
of
Judaea
into
Galilee,
he
went
unto
him,
and
besought
him
that
he
would
come
down,
and
heal
his
son:
for
he
was
at
the
point
of
death.
004:048
Then
said
Jesus
unto
him,
Except
ye
see
signs
and
wonders,
ye
will
not
believe.
004:049
The
nobleman
saith
unto
him,
Sir,
come
down
ere
my
child
die.
004:050
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
Go
thy
way;
thy
son
liveth.
And
the
man
believed
the
word
that
Jesus
had
spoken
unto
him,
and
he
went
his
way.
004:051
And
as
he
was
now
going
down,
his
servants
met
him,
and
told
him,
saying,
Thy
son
liveth.
004:052
Then
enquired
he
of
them
the
hour
when
he
began
to
amend.
And
they
said
unto
him,
Yesterday
at
the
seventh
hour
the
fever
left
him.
004:053
So
the
father
knew
that
it
was
at
the
same
hour,
in
the
which
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Thy
son
liveth:
and
himself
believed,
and
his
whole
house.
004:054
This
is
again
the
second
miracle
that
Jesus
did,
when
he
was
come
out
of
Judaea
into
Galilee.
005:001
After
this
there
was
a
feast
of
the
Jews;
and
Jesus
went
up
to
Jerusalem.
005:002
Now
there
is
at
Jerusalem
by
the
sheep
market
a
pool,
which
is
called
in
the
Hebrew
tongue
Bethesda,
having
five
porches.
005:003
In
these
lay
a
great
multitude
of
impotent
folk,
of
blind,
halt,
withered,
waiting
for
the
moving
of
the
water.
005:004
For
an
angel
went
down
at
a
certain
season
into
the
pool,
and
troubled
the
water:
whosoever
then
first
after
the
troubling
of
the
water
stepped
in
was
made
whole
of
whatsoever
disease
he
had.
005:005
And
a
certain
man
was
there,
which
had
an
infirmity
thirty
and
eight
years.
005:006
When
Jesus
saw
him
lie,
and
knew
that
he
had
been
now
a
long
time
in
that
case,
he
saith
unto
him,
Wilt
thou
be
made
whole?
005:007
The
impotent
man
answered
him,
Sir,
I
have
no
man,
when
the
water
is
troubled,
to
put
me
into
the
pool:
but
while
I
am
coming,
another
steppeth
down
before
me.
005:008
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
Rise,
take
up
thy
bed,
and
walk.
005:009
And
immediately
the
man
was
made
whole,
and
took
up
his
bed,
and
walked:
and
on
the
same
day
was
the
sabbath.
005:010
The
Jews
therefore
said
unto
him
that
was
cured,
It
is
the
sabbath
day:
it
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
carry
thy
bed.
005:011
He
answered
them,
He
that
made
me
whole,
the
same
said
unto
me,
Take
up
thy
bed,
and
walk.
005:012
Then
asked
they
him,
What
man
is
that
which
said
unto
thee,
Take
up
thy
bed,
and
walk?
005:013
And
he
that
was
healed
wist
not
who
it
was:
for
Jesus
had
conveyed
himself
away,
a
multitude
being
in
that
place.
005:014
Afterward
Jesus
findeth
him
in
the
temple,
and
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thou
art
made
whole:
sin
no
more,
lest
a
worse
thing
come
unto
thee.
005:015
The
man
departed,
and
told
the
Jews
that
it
was
Jesus,
which
had
made
him
whole.
005:016
And
therefore
did
the
Jews
persecute
Jesus,
and
sought
to
slay
him,
because
he
had
done
these
things
on
the
sabbath
day.
005:017
But
Jesus
answered
them,
My
Father
worketh
hitherto,
and
I
work.
005:018
Therefore
the
Jews
sought
the
more
to
kill
him,
because
he
not
only
had
broken
the
sabbath,
but
said
also
that
God
was
his
Father,
making
himself
equal
with
God.
005:019
Then
answered
Jesus
and
said
unto
them,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
The
Son
can
do
nothing
of
himself,
but
what
he
seeth
the
Father
do:
for
what
things
soever
he
doeth,
these
also
doeth
the
Son
likewise.
005:020
For
the
Father
loveth
the
Son,
and
sheweth
him
all
things
that
himself
doeth:
and
he
will
shew
him
greater
works
than
these,
that
ye
may
marvel.
005:021
For
as
the
Father
raiseth
up
the
dead,
and
quickeneth
them;
even
so
the
Son
quickeneth
whom
he
will.
005:022
For
the
Father
judgeth
no
man,
but
hath
committed
all
judgment
unto
the
Son:
005:023
That
all
men
should
honour
the
Son,
even
as
they
honour
the
Father.
He
that
honoureth
not
the
Son
honoureth
not
the
Father
which
hath
sent
him.
005:024
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
He
that
heareth
my
word,
and
believeth
on
him
that
sent
me,
hath
everlasting
life,
and
shall
not
come
into
condemnation;
but
is
passed
from
death
unto
life.
005:025
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
The
hour
is
coming,
and
now
is,
when
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
Son
of
God:
and
they
that
hear
