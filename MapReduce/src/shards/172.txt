shall
live.
005:026
For
as
the
Father
hath
life
in
himself;
so
hath
he
given
to
the
Son
to
have
life
in
himself;
005:027
And
hath
given
him
authority
to
execute
judgment
also,
because
he
is
the
Son
of
man.
005:028
Marvel
not
at
this:
for
the
hour
is
coming,
in
the
which
all
that
are
in
the
graves
shall
hear
his
voice,
005:029
And
shall
come
forth;
they
that
have
done
good,
unto
the
resurrection
of
life;
and
they
that
have
done
evil,
unto
the
resurrection
of
damnation.
005:030
I
can
of
mine
own
self
do
nothing:
as
I
hear,
I
judge:
and
my
judgment
is
just;
because
I
seek
not
mine
own
will,
but
the
will
of
the
Father
which
hath
sent
me.
005:031
If
I
bear
witness
of
myself,
my
witness
is
not
true.
005:032
There
is
another
that
beareth
witness
of
me;
and
I
know
that
the
witness
which
he
witnesseth
of
me
is
true.
005:033
Ye
sent
unto
John,
and
he
bare
witness
unto
the
truth.
005:034
But
I
receive
not
testimony
from
man:
but
these
things
I
say,
that
ye
might
be
saved.
005:035
He
was
a
burning
and
a
shining
light:
and
ye
were
willing
for
a
season
to
rejoice
in
his
light.
005:036
But
I
have
greater
witness
than
that
of
John:
for
the
works
which
the
Father
hath
given
me
to
finish,
the
same
works
that
I
do,
bear
witness
of
me,
that
the
Father
hath
sent
me.
005:037
And
the
Father
himself,
which
hath
sent
me,
hath
borne
witness
of
me.
Ye
have
neither
heard
his
voice
at
any
time,
nor
seen
his
shape.
005:038
And
ye
have
not
his
word
abiding
in
you:
for
whom
he
hath
sent,
him
ye
believe
not.
005:039
Search
the
scriptures;
for
in
them
ye
think
ye
have
eternal
life:
and
they
are
they
which
testify
of
me.
005:040
And
ye
will
not
come
to
me,
that
ye
might
have
life.
005:041
I
receive
not
honour
from
men.
005:042
But
I
know
you,
that
ye
have
not
the
love
of
God
in
you.
005:043
I
am
come
in
my
Father's
name,
and
ye
receive
me
not:
if
another
shall
come
in
his
own
name,
him
ye
will
receive.
005:044
How
can
ye
believe,
which
receive
honour
one
of
another,
and
seek
not
the
honour
that
cometh
from
God
only?
005:045
Do
not
think
that
I
will
accuse
you
to
the
Father:
there
is
one
that
accuseth
you,
even
Moses,
in
whom
ye
trust.
005:046
For
had
ye
believed
Moses,
ye
would
have
believed
me;
for
he
wrote
of
me.
005:047
But
if
ye
believe
not
his
writings,
how
shall
ye
believe
my
words?
006:001
After
these
things
Jesus
went
over
the
sea
of
Galilee,
which
is
the
sea
of
Tiberias.
006:002
And
a
great
multitude
followed
him,
because
they
saw
his
miracles
which
he
did
on
them
that
were
diseased.
006:003
And
Jesus
went
up
into
a
mountain,
and
there
he
sat
with
his
disciples.
006:004
And
the
passover,
a
feast
of
the
Jews,
was
nigh.
006:005
When
Jesus
then
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
saw
a
great
company
come
unto
him,
he
saith
unto
Philip,
Whence
shall
we
buy
bread,
that
these
may
eat?
006:006
And
this
he
said
to
prove
him:
for
he
himself
knew
what
he
would
do.
006:007
Philip
answered
him,
Two
hundred
pennyworth
of
bread
is
not
sufficient
for
them,
that
every
one
of
them
may
take
a
little.
006:008
One
of
his
disciples,
Andrew,
Simon
Peter's
brother,
saith
unto
him,
006:009
There
is
a
lad
here,
which
hath
five
barley
loaves,
and
two
small
fishes:
but
what
are
they
among
so
many?
006:010
And
Jesus
said,
Make
the
men
sit
down.
Now
there
was
much
grass
in
the
place.
So
the
men
sat
down,
in
number
about
five
thousand.
006:011
And
Jesus
took
the
loaves;
and
when
he
had
given
thanks,
he
distributed
to
the
disciples,
and
the
disciples
to
them
that
were
set
down;
and
likewise
of
the
fishes
as
much
as
they
would.
006:012
When
they
were
filled,
he
said
unto
his
disciples,
Gather
up
the
fragments
that
remain,
that
nothing
be
lost.
006:013
Therefore
they
gathered
them
together,
and
filled
twelve
baskets
with
the
fragments
of
the
five
barley
loaves,
which
remained
over
and
above
unto
them
that
had
eaten.
006:014
Then
those
men,
when
they
had
seen
the
miracle
that
Jesus
did,
said,
This
is
of
a
truth
that
prophet
that
should
come
into
the
world.
006:015
When
Jesus
therefore
perceived
that
they
would
come
and
take
him
by
force,
to
make
him
a
king,
he
departed
again
into
a
mountain
himself
alone.
006:016
And
when
even
was
now
come,
his
disciples
went
down
unto
the
sea,
006:017
And
entered
into
a
ship,
and
went
over
the
sea
toward
Capernaum.
And
it
was
now
dark,
and
Jesus
was
not
come
to
them.
006:018
And
the
sea
arose
by
reason
of
a
great
wind
that
blew.
006:019
So
when
they
had
rowed
about
five
and
twenty
or
thirty
furlongs,
they
see
Jesus
walking
on
the
sea,
and
drawing
nigh
unto
the
ship:
and
they
were
afraid.
006:020
But
he
saith
unto
them,
It
is
I;
be
not
afraid.
006:021
Then
they
willingly
received
him
into
the
ship:
and
immediately
the
ship
was
at
the
land
whither
they
went.
006:022
The
day
following,
when
the
people
which
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
saw
that
there
was
none
other
boat
there,
save
that
one
whereinto
his
disciples
were
entered,
and
that
Jesus
went
not
with
his
disciples
into
the
boat,
but
that
his
disciples
were
gone
away
alone;
006:023
(Howbeit
there
came
other
boats
from
Tiberias
nigh
unto
the
place
where
they
did
eat
bread,
after
that
the
Lord
had
given
thanks:)
006:024
When
the
people
therefore
saw
that
Jesus
was
not
there,
neither
his
disciples,
they
also
took
shipping,
and
came
to
Capernaum,
seeking
for
Jesus.
006:025
And
when
they
had
found
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea,
they
said
unto
him,
Rabbi,
when
camest
thou
hither?
006:026
Jesus
answered
them
and
said,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
Ye
seek
me,
not
because
ye
saw
the
miracles,
but
because
ye
did
eat
of
the
loaves,
and
were
filled.
006:027
Labour
not
for
the
meat
which
perisheth,
but
for
that
meat
which
endureth
unto
everlasting
life,
which
the
Son
of
man
shall
give
unto
you:
for
him
hath
God
the
Father
sealed.
006:028
Then
said
they
unto
him,
What
shall
we
do,
that
we
might
work
the
works
of
God?
006:029
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
This
is
the
work
of
God,
that
ye
believe
on
him
whom
he
hath
sent.
006:030
They
said
therefore
unto
him,
What
sign
shewest
thou
then,
that
we
may
see,
and
believe
thee?
what
dost
thou
work?
006:031
Our
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
desert;
as
it
is
written,
He
gave
them
bread
from
heaven
to
eat.
006:032
Then
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
Moses
gave
you
not
that
bread
from
heaven;
but
my
Father
giveth
you
the
true
bread
from
heaven.
006:033
For
the
bread
of
God
is
he
which
cometh
down
from
heaven,
and
giveth
life
unto
the
world.
006:034
Then
said
they
unto
him,
Lord,
evermore
give
us
this
bread.
006:035
And
Jesus
said
unto
them,
I
am
the
bread
of
life:
he
that
cometh
to
me
shall
never
hunger;
and
he
that
believeth
on
me
shall
never
thirst.
006:036
But
I
said
unto
you,
That
ye
also
have
seen
me,
and
believe
not.
006:037
All
that
the
Father
giveth
me
shall
come
to
me;
and
him
that
cometh
to
me
I
will
in
no
wise
cast
out.
006:038
For
I
came
down
from
heaven,
not
to
do
mine
own
will,
but
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me.
006:039
And
this
is
the
Father's
will
which
hath
sent
me,
that
of
all
which
he
hath
given
me
I
should
lose
nothing,
but
should
raise
it
up
again
at
the
last
day.
006:040
And
this
is
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me,
that
every
one
which
seeth
the
Son,
and
believeth
on
him,
may
have
everlasting
life:
and
I
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day.
006:041
The
Jews
then
murmured
at
him,
because
he
said,
I
am
the
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven.
006:042
And
they
said,
Is
not
this
Jesus,
the
son
of
Joseph,
whose
father
and
mother
we
know?
how
is
it
then
that
he
saith,
I
came
down
from
heaven?
006:043
Jesus
therefore
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Murmur
not
among
yourselves.
006:044
No
man
can
come
to
me,
except
the
Father
which
hath
sent
me
draw
him:
and
I
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day.
006:045
It
is
written
in
the
prophets,
And
they
shall
be
all
taught
of
God.
Every
man
therefore
that
hath
heard,
and
hath
learned
of
the
Father,
cometh
unto
me.
006:046
Not
that
any
man
hath
seen
the
Father,
save
he
which
is
of
God,
he
hath
seen
the
Father.
006:047
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
He
that
believeth
on
me
hath
everlasting
life.
006:048
I
am
that
bread
of
life.
006:049
Your
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
wilderness,
and
are
dead.
006:050
This
is
the
bread
which
cometh
down
from
heaven,
that
a
man
may
eat
thereof,
and
not
die.
006:051
I
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven:
if
any
man
eat
of
this
bread,
he
shall
live
for
ever:
and
the
bread
that
I
will
give
is
my
flesh,
which
I
will
give
for
the
life
of
the
world.
006:052
The
Jews
therefore
strove
among
themselves,
saying,
How
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
eat?
006:053
Then
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
Except
ye
eat
the
flesh
of
the
Son
of
man,
and
drink
his
blood,
ye
have
no
life
in
you.
006:054
Whoso
eateth
my
flesh,
and
drinketh
my
blood,
hath
eternal
life;
and
I
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day.
006:055
For
my
flesh
is
meat
indeed,
and
my
blood
is
drink
indeed.
006:056
He
that
eateth
my
flesh,
and
drinketh
my
blood,
dwelleth
in
me,
and
I
in
him.
006:057
As
the
living
Father
hath
sent
me,
and
I
live
by
the
Father:
so
he
that
eateth
me,
even
he
shall
live
by
me.
006:058
This
is
that
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven:
not
as
your
fathers
did
eat
manna,
and
are
dead:
he
that
eateth
of
this
bread
shall
live
for
ever.
006:059
These
things
said
he
in
the
synagogue,
as
he
taught
in
Capernaum.
006:060
Many
therefore
of
his
disciples,
when
they
had
heard
this,
said,
This
is
an
hard
saying;
who
can
hear
it?
006:061
When
Jesus
knew
in
himself
that
his
disciples
murmured
at
it,
he
said
unto
them,
Doth
this
offend
you?
006:062
What
and
if
ye
shall
see
the
Son
of
man
ascend
up
where
he
was
before?
006:063
It
is
the
spirit
that
quickeneth;
the
flesh
profiteth
nothing:
the
words
that
I
speak
unto
you,
they
are
spirit,
and
they
are
life.
006:064
But
there
are
some
of
you
that
believe
not.
For
Jesus
knew
from
the
beginning
who
they
were
that
believed
not,
and
who
should
betray
him.
006:065
And
he
said,
Therefore
said
I
unto
you,
that
no
man
can
come
unto
me,
except
it
were
given
unto
him
of
my
Father.
006:066
From
that
time
many
of
his
disciples
went
back,
and
walked
no
more
with
him.
006:067
Then
said
Jesus
unto
the
twelve,
Will
ye
also
go
away?
006:068
Then
Simon
Peter
answered
him,
Lord,
to
whom
shall
we
go?
thou
hast
the
words
of
eternal
life.
006:069
And
we
believe
and
are
sure
that
thou
art
that
Christ,
the
Son
of
the
living
God.
006:070
Jesus
answered
them,
Have
not
I
chosen
you
twelve,
and
one
of
you
is
a
devil?
006:071
He
spake
of
Judas
Iscariot
the
son
of
Simon:
for
he
it
was
that
should
betray
him,
being
one
of
the
twelve.
007:001
After
these
things
Jesus
walked
in
Galilee:
for
he
would
not
walk
in
Jewry,
because
the
Jews
sought
to
kill
him.
007:002
Now
the
Jew's
feast
of
tabernacles
was
at
hand.
007:003
His
brethren
therefore
said
unto
him,
Depart
hence,
and
go
into
Judaea,
that
thy
disciples
also
may
see
the
works
that
thou
doest.
007:004
For
there
is
no
man
that
doeth
any
thing
in
secret,
and
he
himself
seeketh
to
be
known
openly.
If
thou
do
these
things,
shew
thyself
to
the
world.
007:005
For
neither
did
his
brethren
believe
in
him.
007:006
Then
Jesus
said
unto
them,
My
time
is
not
yet
come:
but
your
time
is
alway
ready.
007:007
The
world
cannot
hate
you;
but
me
it
hateth,
because
I
testify
of
it,
that
the
works
thereof
are
evil.
007:008
Go
ye
up
unto
this
feast:
I
go
not
up
yet
unto
this
feast:
for
my
time
is
not
yet
full
come.
007:009
When
he
had
said
these
words
unto
them,
he
abode
still
in
Galilee.
007:010
But
when
his
brethren
were
gone
up,
then
went
he
also
up
unto
the
feast,
not
openly,
but
as
it
were
in
secret.
007:011
Then
the
Jews
sought
him
at
the
feast,
and
said,
Where
is
he?
007:012
And
there
was
much
murmuring
among
the
people
concerning
him:
for
some
said,
He
is
a
good
man:
others
said,
Nay;
but
he
deceiveth
the
people.
007:013
Howbeit
no
man
spake
openly
of
him
for
fear
of
the
Jews.
007:014
Now
about
the
midst
of
the
feast
Jesus
went
up
into
the
temple,
and
taught.
007:015
And
the
Jews
marvelled,
saying,
How
knoweth
this
man
letters,
having
never
learned?
007:016
Jesus
answered
them,
and
said,
My
doctrine
is
not
mine,
but
his
that
sent
me.
007:017
If
any
man
will
do
his
will,
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine,
whether
it
be
of
God,
or
whether
I
speak
of
myself.
007:018
He
that
speaketh
of
himself
seeketh
his
own
glory:
but
he
that
seeketh
his
glory
that
sent
him,
the
same
is
true,
and
no
unrighteousness
is
in
him.
007:019
Did
not
Moses
give
you
the
law,
and
yet
none
of
you
keepeth
the
law?
Why
go
ye
about
to
kill
me?
007:020
The
people
answered
and
said,
Thou
hast
a
devil:
who
goeth
about
to
kill
thee?
007:021
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
I
have
done
one
work,
and
ye
all
marvel.
007:022
Moses
therefore
gave
unto
you
circumcision;
(not
because
it
is
of
Moses,
but
of
the
fathers;)
and
ye
on
the
sabbath
day
circumcise
a
man.
007:023
If
a
man
on
the
sabbath
day
receive
circumcision,
that
the
law
of
Moses
should
not
be
broken;
are
ye
angry
at
me,
because
I
have
made
a
man
every
whit
whole
on
the
sabbath
day?
007:024
Judge
not
according
to
the
appearance,
but
judge
righteous
judgment.
007:025
Then
said
some
of
them
of
Jerusalem,
Is
not
this
he,
whom
they
seek
to
kill?
007:026
But,
lo,
he
speaketh
boldly,
and
they
say
nothing
unto
him.
Do
the
rulers
know
indeed
that
this
is
the
very
Christ?
007:027
Howbeit
we
know
this
man
whence
he
is:
but
when
Christ
cometh,
no
man
knoweth
whence
he
is.
007:028
Then
cried
Jesus
in
the
temple
as
he
taught,
saying,
Ye
both
know
me,
and
ye
know
whence
I
am:
and
I
am
not
come
of
myself,
but
he
that
sent
me
is
true,
whom
ye
know
not.
007:029
But
I
know
him:
for
I
am
from
him,
and
he
hath
sent
me.
007:030
Then
they
sought
to
take
him:
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
him,
because
his
hour
was
not
yet
come.
007:031
And
many
of
the
people
believed
on
him,
and
said,
When
Christ
cometh,
will
he
do
more
miracles
than
these
which
this
man
hath
done?
007:032
The
Pharisees
heard
that
the
people
murmured
such
things
concerning
him;
and
the
Pharisees
and
the
chief
priests
sent
officers
to
take
him.
007:033
Then
said
Jesus
unto
them,
Yet
a
little
while
am
I
with
you,
and
then
I
go
unto
him
that
sent
me.
007:034
Ye
shall
seek
me,
and
shall
not
find
me:
and
where
I
am,
thither
ye
cannot
come.
007:035
Then
said
the
Jews
among
themselves,
Whither
will
he
go,
that
we
shall
not
find
him?
will
he
go
unto
the
dispersed
among
the
Gentiles,
and
teach
the
Gentiles?
007:036
What
manner
of
saying
is
this
that
he
said,
Ye
shall
seek
me,
and
shall
not
find
me:
and
where
I
am,
thither
ye
cannot
come?
007:037
In
the
last
day,
that
great
day
of
the
feast,
Jesus
stood
and
cried,
saying,
If
any
man
thirst,
let
him
come
unto
me,
and
drink.
007:038
He
that
believeth
on
me,
as
the
scripture
hath
said,
out
of
his
belly
shall
flow
rivers
of
living
water.
007:039
(But
this
spake
he
of
the
Spirit,
which
they
that
believe
on
him
should
receive:
for
the
Holy
Ghost
was
not
yet
given;
because
that
Jesus
was
not
yet
glorified.)
007:040
Many
of
the
people
therefore,
when
they
heard
this
saying,
said,
Of
a
truth
this
is
the
Prophet.
007:041
Others
said,
This
is
the
Christ.
But
some
said,
Shall
Christ
come
out
of
Galilee?
007:042
Hath
not
the
scripture
said,
That
Christ
cometh
of
the
seed
of
David,
and
out
of
the
town
of
Bethlehem,
where
David
was?
007:043
So
there
was
a
division
among
the
people
because
of
him.
007:044
And
some
of
them
would
have
taken
him;
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
him.
007:045
Then
came
the
officers
to
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees;
and
they
said
unto
them,
Why
have
ye
not
brought
him?
007:046
The
officers
answered,
Never
man
spake
like
this
man.
007:047
Then
answered
them
the
Pharisees,
Are
ye
also
deceived?
007:048
Have
any
of
the
rulers
or
of
the
Pharisees
believed
on
him?
007:049
But
this
people
who
knoweth
not
the
law
are
cursed.
007:050
Nicodemus
saith
unto
them,
(he
that
came
to
Jesus
by
night,
being
one
of
them,)
007:051
Doth
our
law
judge
any
man,
before
it
hear
him,
and
know
what
he
doeth?
007:052
They
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
also
of
Galilee?
Search,
and
look:
for
out
of
Galilee
ariseth
no
prophet.
007:053
And
every
man
went
unto
his
own
house.
008:001
Jesus
went
unto
the
mount
of
Olives.
008:002
And
early
in
the
morning
he
came
again
into
the
temple,
and
all
the
people
came
unto
him;
and
he
sat
down,
and
taught
them.
008:003
And
the
scribes
and
Pharisees
brought
unto
him
a
woman
taken
in
adultery;
and
when
they
had
set
her
in
the
midst,
008:004
They
say
unto
him,
Master,
this
woman
was
taken
in
adultery,
in
the
very
act.
008:005
Now
Moses
in
the
law
commanded
us,
that
such
should
be
stoned:
but
what
sayest
thou?
008:006
This
they
said,
tempting
him,
that
they
might
have
to
accuse
him.
But
Jesus
stooped
down,
and
with
his
finger
wrote
on
the
ground,
as
though
he
heard
them
not.
008:007
So
when
they
continued
asking
him,
he
lifted
up
himself,
and
said
unto
them,
He
that
is
without
sin
among
you,
let
him
first
cast
a
stone
at
her.
008:008
And
again
he
stooped
down,
and
wrote
on
the
ground.
008:009
And
they
which
heard
it,
being
convicted
by
their
own
conscience,
went
out
one
by
one,
beginning
at
the
eldest,
even
unto
the
last:
and
Jesus
was
left
alone,
and
the
woman
standing
in
the
midst.
008:010
When
Jesus
had
lifted
up
himself,
and
saw
none
but
the
woman,
he
said
unto
her,
Woman,
where
are
those
thine
accusers?
hath
no
man
condemned
thee?
008:011
She
said,
No
man,
Lord.
And
Jesus
said
unto
her,
Neither
do
I
condemn
thee:
go,
and
sin
no
more.
008:012
Then
spake
Jesus
again
unto
them,
saying,
I
am
the
light
of
the
world:
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in
darkness,
but
shall
have
the
light
of
life.
008:013
The
Pharisees
therefore
said
unto
him,
Thou
bearest
record
of
thyself;
thy
record
is
not
true.
008:014
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Though
I
bear
record
of
myself,
yet
my
record
is
true:
for
I
know
whence
I
came,
and
whither
I
go;
but
ye
cannot
tell
whence
I
come,
and
whither
I
go.
008:015
Ye
judge
after
the
flesh;
I
judge
no
man.
008:016
And
yet
if
I
judge,
my
judgment
is
true:
for
I
am
not
alone,
but
I
and
the
Father
that
sent
me.
008:017
It
is
also
written
in
your
law,
that
the
testimony
of
two
men
is
true.
008:018
I
am
one
that
bear
witness
of
myself,
and
the
Father
that
sent
me
beareth
witness
of
me.
008:019
Then
said
they
unto
him,
Where
is
thy
Father?
Jesus
answered,
Ye
neither
know
me,
nor
my
Father:
if
ye
had
known
me,
ye
should
have
known
my
Father
also.
008:020
These
words
spake
Jesus
in
the
treasury,
as
he
taught
in
the
temple:
and
no
man
laid
hands
on
him;
for
his
hour
was
not
yet
come.
008:021
Then
said
Jesus
again
unto
them,
I
go
my
way,
and
ye
shall
seek
me,
and
shall
die
in
your
sins:
whither
I
go,
ye
cannot
come.
008:022
Then
said
the
Jews,
Will
he
kill
himself?
because
he
saith,
Whither
I
go,
ye
cannot
come.
008:023
And
he
said
unto
them,
Ye
are
from
beneath;
I
am
from
above:
ye
are
of
this
world;
I
am
not
of
this
world.
008:024
I
said
therefore
unto
you,
that
ye
shall
die
in
your
sins:
for
if
ye
believe
not
that
I
am
he,
ye
shall
die
in
your
sins.
008:025
Then
said
they
unto
him,
Who
art
thou?
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Even
the
same
that
I
said
unto
you
from
the
beginning.
008:026
I
have
many
things
to
say
and
to
judge
of
you:
but
he
that
sent
me
is
true;
and
I
speak
to
the
world
those
things
which
I
have
heard
of
him.
008:027
They
understood
not
that
he
spake
to
them
of
the
Father.
008:028
Then
said
Jesus
unto
them,
When
ye
have
lifted
up
the
Son
of
man,
then
shall
ye
know
that
I
am
he,
and
that
I
do
nothing
of
myself;
but
as
my
Father
hath
taught
me,
I
speak
these
things.
008:029
And
he
that
sent
me
is
with
me:
the
Father
hath
not
left
me
alone;
for
I
do
always
those
things
that
please
him.
008:030
As
he
spake
these
words,
many
believed
on
him.
008:031
Then
said
Jesus
to
those
Jews
which
believed
on
him,
If
ye
continue
in
my
word,
then
are
ye
my
disciples
indeed;
008:032
And
ye
shall
know
the
truth,
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free.
008:033
They
answered
him,
We
be
Abraham's
seed,
and
were
never
in
bondage
to
any
man:
how
sayest
thou,
Ye
shall
be
made
free?
008:034
Jesus
answered
them,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
Whosoever
committeth
sin
is
the
servant
of
sin.
008:035
And
the
servant
abideth
not
in
the
house
for
ever:
but
the
Son
abideth
ever.
008:036
If
the
Son
therefore
shall
make
you
free,
ye
shall
be
free
indeed.
008:037
I
know
that
ye
are
Abraham's
seed;
but
ye
seek
to
kill
me,
because
my
word
hath
no
place
in
you.
008:038
I
speak
that
which
I
have
seen
with
my
Father:
and
ye
do
that
which
ye
have
seen
with
your
father.
008:039
They
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Abraham
is
our
father.
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
If
ye
were
Abraham's
children,
ye
would
do
the
works
of
Abraham.
008:040
But
now
ye
seek
to
kill
me,
a
man
that
hath
told
you
the
truth,
which
I
have
heard
of
God:
this
did
not
Abraham.
008:041
Ye
do
the
deeds
of
your
father.
Then
said
they
to
him,
We
be
not
born
of
fornication;
we
have
one
Father,
even
God.
008:042
Jesus
said
unto
them,
If
God
were
your
Father,
ye
would
love
me:
for
I
proceeded
forth
and
came
from
God;
neither
came
I
of
myself,
but
he
sent
me.
008:043
Why
do
ye
not
understand
my
speech?
even
because
ye
cannot
hear
my
word.
008:044
Ye
are
of
your
father
the
devil,
and
the
lusts
of
your
father
ye
will
do.
He
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning,
and
abode
not
in
the
truth,
because
