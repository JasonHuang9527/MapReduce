there
is
no
truth
in
him.
When
he
speaketh
a
lie,
he
speaketh
of
his
own:
for
he
is
a
liar,
and
the
father
of
it.
008:045
And
because
I
tell
you
the
truth,
ye
believe
me
not.
008:046
Which
of
you
convinceth
me
of
sin?
And
if
I
say
the
truth,
why
do
ye
not
believe
me?
008:047
He
that
is
of
God
heareth
God's
words:
ye
therefore
hear
them
not,
because
ye
are
not
of
God.
008:048
Then
answered
the
Jews,
and
said
unto
him,
Say
we
not
well
that
thou
art
a
Samaritan,
and
hast
a
devil?
008:049
Jesus
answered,
I
have
not
a
devil;
but
I
honour
my
Father,
and
ye
do
dishonour
me.
008:050
And
I
seek
not
mine
own
glory:
there
is
one
that
seeketh
and
judgeth.
008:051
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
If
a
man
keep
my
saying,
he
shall
never
see
death.
008:052
Then
said
the
Jews
unto
him,
Now
we
know
that
thou
hast
a
devil.
Abraham
is
dead,
and
the
prophets;
and
thou
sayest,
If
a
man
keep
my
saying,
he
shall
never
taste
of
death.
008:053
Art
thou
greater
than
our
father
Abraham,
which
is
dead?
and
the
prophets
are
dead:
whom
makest
thou
thyself?
008:054
Jesus
answered,
If
I
honour
myself,
my
honour
is
nothing:
it
is
my
Father
that
honoureth
me;
of
whom
ye
say,
that
he
is
your
God:
008:055
Yet
ye
have
not
known
him;
but
I
know
him:
and
if
I
should
say,
I
know
him
not,
I
shall
be
a
liar
like
unto
you:
but
I
know
him,
and
keep
his
saying.
008:056
Your
father
Abraham
rejoiced
to
see
my
day:
and
he
saw
it,
and
was
glad.
008:057
Then
said
the
Jews
unto
him,
Thou
art
not
yet
fifty
years
old,
and
hast
thou
seen
Abraham?
008:058
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
Before
Abraham
was,
I
am.
008:059
Then
took
they
up
stones
to
cast
at
him:
but
Jesus
hid
himself,
and
went
out
of
the
temple,
going
through
the
midst
of
them,
and
so
passed
by.
009:001
And
as
Jesus
passed
by,
he
saw
a
man
which
was
blind
from
his
birth.
009:002
And
his
disciples
asked
him,
saying,
Master,
who
did
sin,
this
man,
or
his
parents,
that
he
was
born
blind?
009:003
Jesus
answered,
Neither
hath
this
man
sinned,
nor
his
parents:
but
that
the
works
of
God
should
be
made
manifest
in
him.
009:004
I
must
work
the
works
of
him
that
sent
me,
while
it
is
day:
the
night
cometh,
when
no
man
can
work.
009:005
As
long
as
I
am
in
the
world,
I
am
the
light
of
the
world.
009:006
When
he
had
thus
spoken,
he
spat
on
the
ground,
and
made
clay
of
the
spittle,
and
he
anointed
the
eyes
of
the
blind
man
with
the
clay,
009:007
And
said
unto
him,
Go,
wash
in
the
pool
of
Siloam,
(which
is
by
interpretation,
Sent.)
He
went
his
way
therefore,
and
washed,
and
came
seeing.
009:008
The
neighbours
therefore,
and
they
which
before
had
seen
him
that
he
was
blind,
said,
Is
not
this
he
that
sat
and
begged?
009:009
Some
said,
This
is
he:
others
said,
He
is
like
him:
but
he
said,
I
am
he.
009:010
Therefore
said
they
unto
him,
How
were
thine
eyes
opened?
009:011
He
answered
and
said,
A
man
that
is
called
Jesus
made
clay,
and
anointed
mine
eyes,
and
said
unto
me,
Go
to
the
pool
of
Siloam,
and
wash:
and
I
went
and
washed,
and
I
received
sight.
009:012
Then
said
they
unto
him,
Where
is
he?
He
said,
I
know
not.
009:013
They
brought
to
the
Pharisees
him
that
aforetime
was
blind.
009:014
And
it
was
the
sabbath
day
when
Jesus
made
the
clay,
and
opened
his
eyes.
009:015
Then
again
the
Pharisees
also
asked
him
how
he
had
received
his
sight.
He
said
unto
them,
He
put
clay
upon
mine
eyes,
and
I
washed,
and
do
see.
009:016
Therefore
said
some
of
the
Pharisees,
This
man
is
not
of
God,
because
he
keepeth
not
the
sabbath
day.
Others
said,
How
can
a
man
that
is
a
sinner
do
such
miracles?
And
there
was
a
division
among
them.
009:017
They
say
unto
the
blind
man
again,
What
sayest
thou
of
him,
that
he
hath
opened
thine
eyes?
He
said,
He
is
a
prophet.
009:018
But
the
Jews
did
not
believe
concerning
him,
that
he
had
been
blind,
and
received
his
sight,
until
they
called
the
parents
of
him
that
had
received
his
sight.
009:019
And
they
asked
them,
saying,
Is
this
your
son,
who
ye
say
was
born
blind?
how
then
doth
he
now
see?
009:020
His
parents
answered
them
and
said,
We
know
that
this
is
our
son,
and
that
he
was
born
blind:
009:021
But
by
what
means
he
now
seeth,
we
know
not;
or
who
hath
opened
his
eyes,
we
know
not:
he
is
of
age;
ask
him:
he
shall
speak
for
himself.
009:022
These
words
spake
his
parents,
because
they
feared
the
Jews:
for
the
Jews
had
agreed
already,
that
if
any
man
did
confess
that
he
was
Christ,
he
should
be
put
out
of
the
synagogue.
009:023
Therefore
said
his
parents,
He
is
of
age;
ask
him.
009:024
Then
again
called
they
the
man
that
was
blind,
and
said
unto
him,
Give
God
the
praise:
we
know
that
this
man
is
a
sinner.
009:025
He
answered
and
said,
Whether
he
be
a
sinner
or
no,
I
know
not:
one
thing
I
know,
that,
whereas
I
was
blind,
now
I
see.
009:026
Then
said
they
to
him
again,
What
did
he
to
thee?
how
opened
he
thine
eyes?
009:027
He
answered
them,
I
have
told
you
already,
and
ye
did
not
hear:
wherefore
would
ye
hear
it
again?
will
ye
also
be
his
disciples?
009:028
Then
they
reviled
him,
and
said,
Thou
art
his
disciple;
but
we
are
Moses'
disciples.
009:029
We
know
that
God
spake
unto
Moses:
as
for
this
fellow,
we
know
not
from
whence
he
is.
009:030
The
man
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Why
herein
is
a
marvellous
thing,
that
ye
know
not
from
whence
he
is,
and
yet
he
hath
opened
mine
eyes.
009:031
Now
we
know
that
God
heareth
not
sinners:
but
if
any
man
be
a
worshipper
of
God,
and
doeth
his
will,
him
he
heareth.
009:032
Since
the
world
began
was
it
not
heard
that
any
man
opened
the
eyes
of
one
that
was
born
blind.
009:033
If
this
man
were
not
of
God,
he
could
do
nothing.
009:034
They
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Thou
wast
altogether
born
in
sins,
and
dost
thou
teach
us?
And
they
cast
him
out.
009:035
Jesus
heard
that
they
had
cast
him
out;
and
when
he
had
found
him,
he
said
unto
him,
Dost
thou
believe
on
the
Son
of
God?
009:036
He
answered
and
said,
Who
is
he,
Lord,
that
I
might
believe
on
him?
009:037
And
Jesus
said
unto
him,
Thou
hast
both
seen
him,
and
it
is
he
that
talketh
with
thee.
009:038
And
he
said,
Lord,
I
believe.
And
he
worshipped
him.
009:039
And
Jesus
said,
For
judgment
I
am
come
into
this
world,
that
they
which
see
not
might
see;
and
that
they
which
see
might
be
made
blind.
009:040
And
some
of
the
Pharisees
which
were
with
him
heard
these
words,
and
said
unto
him,
Are
we
blind
also?
009:041
Jesus
said
unto
them,
If
ye
were
blind,
ye
should
have
no
sin:
but
now
ye
say,
We
see;
therefore
your
sin
remaineth.
010:001
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
He
that
entereth
not
by
the
door
into
the
sheepfold,
but
climbeth
up
some
other
way,
the
same
is
a
thief
and
a
robber.
010:002
But
he
that
entereth
in
by
the
door
is
the
shepherd
of
the
sheep.
010:003
To
him
the
porter
openeth;
and
the
sheep
hear
his
voice:
and
he
calleth
his
own
sheep
by
name,
and
leadeth
them
out.
010:004
And
when
he
putteth
forth
his
own
sheep,
he
goeth
before
them,
and
the
sheep
follow
him:
for
they
know
his
voice.
010:005
And
a
stranger
will
they
not
follow,
but
will
flee
from
him:
for
they
know
not
the
voice
of
strangers.
010:006
This
parable
spake
Jesus
unto
them:
but
they
understood
not
what
things
they
were
which
he
spake
unto
them.
010:007
Then
said
Jesus
unto
them
again,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
I
am
the
door
of
the
sheep.
010:008
All
that
ever
came
before
me
are
thieves
and
robbers:
but
the
sheep
did
not
hear
them.
010:009
I
am
the
door:
by
me
if
any
man
enter
in,
he
shall
be
saved,
and
shall
go
in
and
out,
and
find
pasture.
010:010
The
thief
cometh
not,
but
for
to
steal,
and
to
kill,
and
to
destroy:
I
am
come
that
they
might
have
life,
and
that
they
might
have
it
more
abundantly.
010:011
I
am
the
good
shepherd:
the
good
shepherd
giveth
his
life
for
the
sheep.
010:012
But
he
that
is
an
hireling,
and
not
the
shepherd,
whose
own
the
sheep
are
not,
seeth
the
wolf
coming,
and
leaveth
the
sheep,
and
fleeth:
and
the
wolf
catcheth
them,
and
scattereth
the
sheep.
010:013
The
hireling
fleeth,
because
he
is
an
hireling,
and
careth
not
for
the
sheep.
010:014
I
am
the
good
shepherd,
and
know
my
sheep,
and
am
known
of
mine.
010:015
As
the
Father
knoweth
me,
even
so
know
I
the
Father:
and
I
lay
down
my
life
for
the
sheep.
010:016
And
other
sheep
I
have,
which
are
not
of
this
fold:
them
also
I
must
bring,
and
they
shall
hear
my
voice;
and
there
shall
be
one
fold,
and
one
shepherd.
010:017
Therefore
doth
my
Father
love
me,
because
I
lay
down
my
life,
that
I
might
take
it
again.
010:018
No
man
taketh
it
from
me,
but
I
lay
it
down
of
myself.
I
have
power
to
lay
it
down,
and
I
have
power
to
take
it
again.
This
commandment
have
I
received
of
my
Father.
010:019
There
was
a
division
therefore
again
among
the
Jews
for
these
sayings.
010:020
And
many
of
them
said,
He
hath
a
devil,
and
is
mad;
why
hear
ye
him?
010:021
Others
said,
These
are
not
the
words
of
him
that
hath
a
devil.
Can
a
devil
open
the
eyes
of
the
blind?
010:022
And
it
was
at
Jerusalem
the
feast
of
the
dedication,
and
it
was
winter.
010:023
And
Jesus
walked
in
the
temple
in
Solomon's
porch.
010:024
Then
came
the
Jews
round
about
him,
and
said
unto
him,
How
long
dost
thou
make
us
to
doubt?
If
thou
be
the
Christ,
tell
us
plainly.
010:025
Jesus
answered
them,
I
told
you,
and
ye
believed
not:
the
works
that
I
do
in
my
Father's
name,
they
bear
witness
of
me.
010:026
But
ye
believe
not,
because
ye
are
not
of
my
sheep,
as
I
said
unto
you.
010:027
My
sheep
hear
my
voice,
and
I
know
them,
and
they
follow
me:
010:028
And
I
give
unto
them
eternal
life;
and
they
shall
never
perish,
neither
shall
any
man
pluck
them
out
of
my
hand.
010:029
My
Father,
which
gave
them
me,
is
greater
than
all;
and
no
man
is
able
to
pluck
them
out
of
my
Father's
hand.
010:030
I
and
my
Father
are
one.
010:031
Then
the
Jews
took
up
stones
again
to
stone
him.
010:032
Jesus
answered
them,
Many
good
works
have
I
shewed
you
from
my
Father;
for
which
of
those
works
do
ye
stone
me?
010:033
The
Jews
answered
him,
saying,
For
a
good
work
we
stone
thee
not;
but
for
blasphemy;
and
because
that
thou,
being
a
man,
makest
thyself
God.
010:034
Jesus
answered
them,
Is
it
not
written
in
your
law,
I
said,
Ye
are
gods?
010:035
If
he
called
them
gods,
unto
whom
the
word
of
God
came,
and
the
scripture
cannot
be
broken;
010:036
Say
ye
of
him,
whom
the
Father
hath
sanctified,
and
sent
into
the
world,
Thou
blasphemest;
because
I
said,
I
am
the
Son
of
God?
010:037
If
I
do
not
the
works
of
my
Father,
believe
me
not.
010:038
But
if
I
do,
though
ye
believe
not
me,
believe
the
works:
that
ye
may
know,
and
believe,
that
the
Father
is
in
me,
and
I
in
him.
010:039
Therefore
they
sought
again
to
take
him:
but
he
escaped
out
of
their
hand,
010:040
And
went
away
again
beyond
Jordan
into
the
place
where
John
at
first
baptized;
and
there
he
abode.
010:041
And
many
resorted
unto
him,
and
said,
John
did
no
miracle:
but
all
things
that
John
spake
of
this
man
were
true.
010:042
And
many
believed
on
him
there.
011:001
Now
a
certain
man
was
sick,
named
Lazarus,
of
Bethany,
the
town
of
Mary
and
her
sister
Martha.
011:002
(It
was
that
Mary
which
anointed
the
Lord
with
ointment,
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair,
whose
brother
Lazarus
was
sick.)
011:003
Therefore
his
sisters
sent
unto
him,
saying,
Lord,
behold,
he
whom
thou
lovest
is
sick.
011:004
When
Jesus
heard
that,
he
said,
This
sickness
is
not
unto
death,
but
for
the
glory
of
God,
that
the
Son
of
God
might
be
glorified
thereby.
011:005
Now
Jesus
loved
Martha,
and
her
sister,
and
Lazarus.
011:006
When
he
had
heard
therefore
that
he
was
sick,
he
abode
two
days
still
in
the
same
place
where
he
was.
011:007
Then
after
that
saith
he
to
his
disciples,
Let
us
go
into
Judaea
again.
011:008
His
disciples
say
unto
him,
Master,
the
Jews
of
late
sought
to
stone
thee;
and
goest
thou
thither
again?
011:009
Jesus
answered,
Are
there
not
twelve
hours
in
the
day?
If
any
man
walk
in
the
day,
he
stumbleth
not,
because
he
seeth
the
light
of
this
world.
011:010
But
if
a
man
walk
in
the
night,
he
stumbleth,
because
there
is
no
light
in
him.
011:011
These
things
said
he:
and
after
that
he
saith
unto
them,
Our
friend
Lazarus
sleepeth;
but
I
go,
that
I
may
awake
him
out
of
sleep.
011:012
Then
said
his
disciples,
Lord,
if
he
sleep,
he
shall
do
well.
011:013
Howbeit
Jesus
spake
of
his
death:
but
they
thought
that
he
had
spoken
of
taking
of
rest
in
sleep.
011:014
Then
said
Jesus
unto
them
plainly,
Lazarus
is
dead.
011:015
And
I
am
glad
for
your
sakes
that
I
was
not
there,
to
the
intent
ye
may
believe;
nevertheless
let
us
go
unto
him.
011:016
Then
said
Thomas,
which
is
called
Didymus,
unto
his
fellowdisciples,
Let
us
also
go,
that
we
may
die
with
him.
011:017
Then
when
Jesus
came,
he
found
that
he
had
lain
in
the
grave
four
days
already.
011:018
Now
Bethany
was
nigh
unto
Jerusalem,
about
fifteen
furlongs
off:
011:019
And
many
of
the
Jews
came
to
Martha
and
Mary,
to
comfort
them
concerning
their
brother.
011:020
Then
Martha,
as
soon
as
she
heard
that
Jesus
was
coming,
went
and
met
him:
but
Mary
sat
still
in
the
house.
011:021
Then
said
Martha
unto
Jesus,
Lord,
if
thou
hadst
been
here,
my
brother
had
not
died.
011:022
But
I
know,
that
even
now,
whatsoever
thou
wilt
ask
of
God,
God
will
give
it
thee.
011:023
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Thy
brother
shall
rise
again.
011:024
Martha
saith
unto
him,
I
know
that
he
shall
rise
again
in
the
resurrection
at
the
last
day.
011:025
Jesus
said
unto
her,
I
am
the
resurrection,
and
the
life:
he
that
believeth
in
me,
though
he
were
dead,
yet
shall
he
live:
011:026
And
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die.
Believest
thou
this?
011:027
She
saith
unto
him,
Yea,
Lord:
I
believe
that
thou
art
the
Christ,
the
Son
of
God,
which
should
come
into
the
world.
011:028
And
when
she
had
so
said,
she
went
her
way,
and
called
Mary
her
sister
secretly,
saying,
The
Master
is
come,
and
calleth
for
thee.
011:029
As
soon
as
she
heard
that,
she
arose
quickly,
and
came
unto
him.
011:030
Now
Jesus
was
not
yet
come
into
the
town,
but
was
in
that
place
where
Martha
met
him.
011:031
The
Jews
then
which
were
with
her
in
the
house,
and
comforted
her,
when
they
saw
Mary,
that
she
rose
up
hastily
and
went
out,
followed
her,
saying,
She
goeth
unto
the
grave
to
weep
there.
011:032
Then
when
Mary
was
come
where
Jesus
was,
and
saw
him,
she
fell
down
at
his
feet,
saying
unto
him,
Lord,
if
thou
hadst
been
here,
my
brother
had
not
died.
011:033
When
Jesus
therefore
saw
her
weeping,
and
the
Jews
also
weeping
which
came
with
her,
he
groaned
in
the
spirit,
and
was
troubled.
011:034
And
said,
Where
have
ye
laid
him?
They
said
unto
him,
Lord,
come
and
see.
011:035
Jesus
wept.
011:036
Then
said
the
Jews,
Behold
how
he
loved
him!
011:037
And
some
of
them
said,
Could
not
this
man,
which
opened
the
eyes
of
the
blind,
have
caused
that
even
this
man
should
not
have
died?
011:038
Jesus
therefore
again
groaning
in
himself
cometh
to
the
grave.
It
was
a
cave,
and
a
stone
lay
upon
it.
011:039
Jesus
said,
Take
ye
away
the
stone.
Martha,
the
sister
of
him
that
was
dead,
saith
unto
him,
Lord,
by
this
time
he
stinketh:
for
he
hath
been
dead
four
days.
011:040
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Said
I
not
unto
thee,
that,
if
thou
wouldest
believe,
thou
shouldest
see
the
glory
of
God?
011:041
Then
they
took
away
the
stone
from
the
place
where
the
dead
was
laid.
And
Jesus
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
said,
Father,
I
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
me.
011:042
And
I
knew
that
thou
hearest
me
always:
but
because
of
the
people
which
stand
by
I
said
it,
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me.
011:043
And
when
he
thus
had
spoken,
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
Lazarus,
come
forth.
011:044
And
he
that
was
dead
came
forth,
bound
hand
and
foot
with
graveclothes:
and
his
face
was
bound
about
with
a
napkin.
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Loose
him,
and
let
him
go.
011:045
Then
many
of
the
Jews
which
came
to
Mary,
and
had
seen
the
things
which
Jesus
did,
believed
on
him.
011:046
But
some
of
them
went
their
ways
to
the
Pharisees,
and
told
them
what
things
Jesus
had
done.
011:047
Then
gathered
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
a
council,
and
said,
What
do
we?
for
this
man
doeth
many
miracles.
011:048
If
we
let
him
thus
alone,
all
men
will
believe
on
him:
and
the
Romans
shall
come
and
take
away
both
our
place
and
nation.
011:049
And
one
of
them,
named
Caiaphas,
being
the
high
priest
that
same
year,
said
unto
them,
Ye
know
nothing
at
all,
011:050
Nor
consider
that
it
is
expedient
for
us,
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
people,
and
that
the
whole
nation
perish
not.
011:051
And
this
spake
he
not
of
himself:
but
being
high
priest
that
year,
he
prophesied
that
Jesus
should
die
for
that
nation;
011:052
And
not
for
that
nation
only,
but
that
also
he
should
gather
together
in
one
the
children
of
God
that
were
scattered
abroad.
011:053
Then
from
that
day
forth
they
took
counsel
together
for
to
put
him
to
death.
011:054
Jesus
therefore
walked
no
more
openly
among
the
Jews;
but
went
thence
unto
a
country
near
to
the
wilderness,
into
a
city
called
Ephraim,
and
there
continued
with
his
disciples.
011:055
And
the
Jews'
passover
was
nigh
at
hand:
and
many
went
out
of
the
country
up
to
Jerusalem
before
the
passover,
to
purify
themselves.
011:056
Then
sought
they
for
Jesus,
and
spake
among
themselves,
as
they
stood
in
the
temple,
What
think
ye,
that
he
will
not
come
to
the
feast?
011:057
Now
both
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
had
given
a
commandment,
that,
if
any
man
knew
where
he
were,
he
should
shew
it,
that
they
might
take
him.
012:001
Then
Jesus
six
days
before
the
passover
came
to
Bethany,
where
Lazarus
was,
which
had
been
dead,
whom
he
raised
from
the
dead.
012:002
There
they
made
him
a
supper;
and
Martha
served:
but
Lazarus
was
one
of
them
that
sat
at
the
table
with
him.
012:003
Then
took
Mary
a
pound
of
ointment
of
spikenard,
very
costly,
and
anointed
the
feet
of
Jesus,
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair:
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
odour
of
the
ointment.
012:004
Then
saith
one
of
his
disciples,
Judas
Iscariot,
Simon's
son,
which
should
betray
him,
012:005
Why
was
not
this
ointment
sold
for
three
hundred
pence,
and
given
to
the
poor?
012:006
This
he
said,
not
that
he
cared
for
the
poor;
but
because
he
was
a
thief,
and
had
the
bag,
and
bare
what
was
put
therein.
012:007
Then
said
Jesus,
Let
her
alone:
against
the
day
of
my
burying
hath
she
kept
this.
012:008
For
the
poor
always
ye
have
with
you;
but
me
ye
have
not
always.
012:009
Much
people
of
the
Jews
therefore
knew
that
he
was
there:
and
they
came
not
for
Jesus'
sake
only,
but
that
they
might
see
Lazarus
also,
whom
he
had
raised
from
the
dead.
012:010
But
the
chief
priests
consulted
that
they
might
put
Lazarus
also
to
death;
012:011
Because
that
by
reason
of
him
many
of
the
Jews
went
away,
and
believed
on
Jesus.
012:012
On
the
next
day
much
people
that
were
come
to
the
feast,
when
they
heard
that
Jesus
was
coming
to
Jerusalem,
012:013
Took
branches
of
palm
trees,
and
went
forth
to
meet
him,
and
cried,
Hosanna:
Blessed
is
the
King
of
Israel
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Lord.
012:014
And
Jesus,
when
he
had
found
a
young
ass,
sat
thereon;
as
it
is
written,
012:015
Fear
not,
daughter
of
Sion:
behold,
thy
King
cometh,
sitting
on
an
ass's
colt.
012:016
These
things
understood
not
his
disciples
at
the
first:
but
when
Jesus
was
glorified,
then
remembered
they
that
these
things
were
written
of
him,
and
that
they
had
done
these
things
unto
him.
012:017
The
people
therefore
that
was
with
him
when
he
called
Lazarus
out
of
his
grave,
and
raised
him
from
the
dead,
bare
record.
012:018
For
this
cause
the
people
also
met
him,
for
that
they
heard
that
he
had
done
this
miracle.
012:019
The
Pharisees
therefore
said
among
themselves,
Perceive
ye
how
ye
prevail
nothing?
behold,
the
world
is
gone
after
him.
012:020
And
there
were
certain
Greeks
among
them
that
came
up
to
worship
at
the
feast:
012:021
The
same
came
therefore
to
Philip,
which
was
of
Bethsaida
of
Galilee,
and
desired
him,
saying,
Sir,
we
would
see
Jesus.
012:022
Philip
cometh
and
telleth
Andrew:
and
again
Andrew
and
Philip
tell
Jesus.
012:023
And
Jesus
answered
them,
saying,
The
hour
is
come,
that
the
Son
of
man
should
be
glorified.
012:024
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
Except
a
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
ground
and
die,
it
abideth
alone:
but
if
it
die,
it
bringeth
forth
much
fruit.
012:025
He
that
loveth
his
life
shall
lose
it;
and
he
that
hateth
his
life
in
this
world
shall
keep
it
unto
life
eternal.
012:026
If
any
man
serve
me,
let
him
follow
me;
and
where
I
am,
there
shall
also
my
servant
be:
if
any
man
serve
me,
him
will
my
Father
honour.
012:027
Now
is
my
soul
troubled;
and
what
shall
I
say?
Father,
save
me
from
this
hour:
but
for
this
cause
came
I
unto
this
hour.
012:028
Father,
glorify
thy
name.
Then
came
there
a
voice
from
heaven,
saying,
I
have
both
glorified
it,
and
will
glorify
it
again.
012:029
The
people
therefore,
that
stood
by,
and
heard
it,
said
that
it
thundered:
others
said,
An
angel
spake
to
him.
012:030
Jesus
answered
and
said,
This
voice
came
not
because
of
me,
but
for
your
sakes.
012:031
Now
is
the
judgment
of
this
world:
now
shall
the
prince
of
this
world
be
cast
out.
012:032
And
I,
if
I
be
lifted
up
from
the
earth,
will
draw
all
men
unto
me.
012:033
This
he
said,
signifying
what
death
he
should
die.
012:034
The
people
answered
him,
We
have
heard
out
of
the
law
that
Christ
abideth
for
ever:
and
how
sayest
thou,
The
Son
of
man
must
be
lifted
up?
who
is
this
Son
of
man?
012:035
Then
Jesus
said
unto
them,
Yet
a
little
while
is
the
light
with
you.
