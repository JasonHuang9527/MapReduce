while
ye
have
the
light,
lest
darkness
come
upon
you:
for
he
that
walketh
in
darkness
knoweth
not
whither
he
goeth.
012:036
While
ye
have
light,
believe
in
the
light,
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
light.
These
things
spake
Jesus,
and
departed,
and
did
hide
himself
from
them.
012:037
But
though
he
had
done
so
many
miracles
before
them,
yet
they
believed
not
on
him:
012:038
That
the
saying
of
Esaias
the
prophet
might
be
fulfilled,
which
he
spake,
Lord,
who
hath
believed
our
report?
and
to
whom
hath
the
arm
of
the
Lord
been
revealed?
012:039
Therefore
they
could
not
believe,
because
that
Esaias
said
again,
012:040
He
hath
blinded
their
eyes,
and
hardened
their
heart;
that
they
should
not
see
with
their
eyes,
nor
understand
with
their
heart,
and
be
converted,
and
I
should
heal
them.
012:041
These
things
said
Esaias,
when
he
saw
his
glory,
and
spake
of
him.
012:042
Nevertheless
among
the
chief
rulers
also
many
believed
on
him;
but
because
of
the
Pharisees
they
did
not
confess
him,
lest
they
should
be
put
out
of
the
synagogue:
012:043
For
they
loved
the
praise
of
men
more
than
the
praise
of
God.
012:044
Jesus
cried
and
said,
He
that
believeth
on
me,
believeth
not
on
me,
but
on
him
that
sent
me.
012:045
And
he
that
seeth
me
seeth
him
that
sent
me.
012:046
I
am
come
a
light
into
the
world,
that
whosoever
believeth
on
me
should
not
abide
in
darkness.
012:047
And
if
any
man
hear
my
words,
and
believe
not,
I
judge
him
not:
for
I
came
not
to
judge
the
world,
but
to
save
the
world.
012:048
He
that
rejecteth
me,
and
receiveth
not
my
words,
hath
one
that
judgeth
him:
the
word
that
I
have
spoken,
the
same
shall
judge
him
in
the
last
day.
012:049
For
I
have
not
spoken
of
myself;
but
the
Father
which
sent
me,
he
gave
me
a
commandment,
what
I
should
say,
and
what
I
should
speak.
012:050
And
I
know
that
his
commandment
is
life
everlasting:
whatsoever
I
speak
therefore,
even
as
the
Father
said
unto
me,
so
I
speak.
013:001
Now
before
the
feast
of
the
passover,
when
Jesus
knew
that
his
hour
was
come
that
he
should
depart
out
of
this
world
unto
the
Father,
having
loved
his
own
which
were
in
the
world,
he
loved
them
unto
the
end.
013:002
And
supper
being
ended,
the
devil
having
now
put
into
the
heart
of
Judas
Iscariot,
Simon's
son,
to
betray
him;
013:003
Jesus
knowing
that
the
Father
had
given
all
things
into
his
hands,
and
that
he
was
come
from
God,
and
went
to
God;
013:004
He
riseth
from
supper,
and
laid
aside
his
garments;
and
took
a
towel,
and
girded
himself.
013:005
After
that
he
poureth
water
into
a
bason,
and
began
to
wash
the
disciples'
feet,
and
to
wipe
them
with
the
towel
wherewith
he
was
girded.
013:006
Then
cometh
he
to
Simon
Peter:
and
Peter
saith
unto
him,
Lord,
dost
thou
wash
my
feet?
013:007
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
What
I
do
thou
knowest
not
now;
but
thou
shalt
know
hereafter.
013:008
Peter
saith
unto
him,
Thou
shalt
never
wash
my
feet.
Jesus
answered
him,
If
I
wash
thee
not,
thou
hast
no
part
with
me.
013:009
Simon
Peter
saith
unto
him,
Lord,
not
my
feet
only,
but
also
my
hands
and
my
head.
013:010
Jesus
saith
to
him,
He
that
is
washed
needeth
not
save
to
wash
his
feet,
but
is
clean
every
whit:
and
ye
are
clean,
but
not
all.
013:011
For
he
knew
who
should
betray
him;
therefore
said
he,
Ye
are
not
all
clean.
013:012
So
after
he
had
washed
their
feet,
and
had
taken
his
garments,
and
was
set
down
again,
he
said
unto
them,
Know
ye
what
I
have
done
to
you?
013:013
Ye
call
me
Master
and
Lord:
and
ye
say
well;
for
so
I
am.
013:014
If
I
then,
your
Lord
and
Master,
have
washed
your
feet;
ye
also
ought
to
wash
one
another's
feet.
013:015
For
I
have
given
you
an
example,
that
ye
should
do
as
I
have
done
to
you.
013:016
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
The
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord;
neither
he
that
is
sent
greater
than
he
that
sent
him.
013:017
If
ye
know
these
things,
happy
are
ye
if
ye
do
them.
013:018
I
speak
not
of
you
all:
I
know
whom
I
have
chosen:
but
that
the
scripture
may
be
fulfilled,
He
that
eateth
bread
with
me
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me.
013:019
Now
I
tell
you
before
it
come,
that,
when
it
is
come
to
pass,
ye
may
believe
that
I
am
he.
013:020
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
He
that
receiveth
whomsoever
I
send
receiveth
me;
and
he
that
receiveth
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
me.
013:021
When
Jesus
had
thus
said,
he
was
troubled
in
spirit,
and
testified,
and
said,
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
me.
013:022
Then
the
disciples
looked
one
on
another,
doubting
of
whom
he
spake.
013:023
Now
there
was
leaning
on
Jesus'
bosom
one
of
his
disciples,
whom
Jesus
loved.
013:024
Simon
Peter
therefore
beckoned
to
him,
that
he
should
ask
who
it
should
be
of
whom
he
spake.
013:025
He
then
lying
on
Jesus'
breast
saith
unto
him,
Lord,
who
is
it?
013:026
Jesus
answered,
He
it
is,
to
whom
I
shall
give
a
sop,
when
I
have
dipped
it.
And
when
he
had
dipped
the
sop,
he
gave
it
to
Judas
Iscariot,
the
son
of
Simon.
013:027
And
after
the
sop
Satan
entered
into
him.
Then
said
Jesus
unto
him,
That
thou
doest,
do
quickly.
013:028
Now
no
man
at
the
table
knew
for
what
intent
he
spake
this
unto
him.
013:029
For
some
of
them
thought,
because
Judas
had
the
bag,
that
Jesus
had
said
unto
him,
Buy
those
things
that
we
have
need
of
against
the
feast;
or,
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
poor.
013:030
He
then
having
received
the
sop
went
immediately
out:
and
it
was
night.
013:031
Therefore,
when
he
was
gone
out,
Jesus
said,
Now
is
the
Son
of
man
glorified,
and
God
is
glorified
in
him.
013:032
If
God
be
glorified
in
him,
God
shall
also
glorify
him
in
himself,
and
shall
straightway
glorify
him.
013:033
Little
children,
yet
a
little
while
I
am
with
you.
Ye
shall
seek
me:
and
as
I
said
unto
the
Jews,
Whither
I
go,
ye
cannot
come;
so
now
I
say
to
you.
013:034
A
new
commandment
I
give
unto
you,
That
ye
love
one
another;
as
I
have
loved
you,
that
ye
also
love
one
another.
013:035
By
this
shall
all
men
know
that
ye
are
my
disciples,
if
ye
have
love
one
to
another.
013:036
Simon
Peter
said
unto
him,
Lord,
whither
goest
thou?
Jesus
answered
him,
Whither
I
go,
thou
canst
not
follow
me
now;
but
thou
shalt
follow
me
afterwards.
013:037
Peter
said
unto
him,
Lord,
why
cannot
I
follow
thee
now?
I
will
lay
down
my
life
for
thy
sake.
013:038
Jesus
answered
him,
Wilt
thou
lay
down
thy
life
for
my
sake?
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
thee,
The
cock
shall
not
crow,
till
thou
hast
denied
me
thrice.
014:001
Let
not
your
heart
be
troubled:
ye
believe
in
God,
believe
also
in
me.
014:002
In
my
Father's
house
are
many
mansions:
if
it
were
not
so,
I
would
have
told
you.
I
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you.
014:003
And
if
I
go
and
prepare
a
place
for
you,
I
will
come
again,
and
receive
you
unto
myself;
that
where
I
am,
there
ye
may
be
also.
014:004
And
whither
I
go
ye
know,
and
the
way
ye
know.
014:005
Thomas
saith
unto
him,
Lord,
we
know
not
whither
thou
goest;
and
how
can
we
know
the
way?
014:006
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
I
am
the
way,
the
truth,
and
the
life:
no
man
cometh
unto
the
Father,
but
by
me.
014:007
If
ye
had
known
me,
ye
should
have
known
my
Father
also:
and
from
henceforth
ye
know
him,
and
have
seen
him.
014:008
Philip
saith
unto
him,
Lord,
shew
us
the
Father,
and
it
sufficeth
us.
014:009
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
Have
I
been
so
long
time
with
you,
and
yet
hast
thou
not
known
me,
Philip?
he
that
hath
seen
me
hath
seen
the
Father;
and
how
sayest
thou
then,
Shew
us
the
Father?
014:010
Believest
thou
not
that
I
am
in
the
Father,
and
the
Father
in
me?
the
words
that
I
speak
unto
you
I
speak
not
of
myself:
but
the
Father
that
dwelleth
in
me,
he
doeth
the
works.
014:011
Believe
me
that
I
am
in
the
Father,
and
the
Father
in
me:
or
else
believe
me
for
the
very
works'
sake.
014:012
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
He
that
believeth
on
me,
the
works
that
I
do
shall
he
do
also;
and
greater
works
than
these
shall
he
do;
because
I
go
unto
my
Father.
014:013
And
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
my
name,
that
will
I
do,
that
the
Father
may
be
glorified
in
the
Son.
014:014
If
ye
shall
ask
any
thing
in
my
name,
I
will
do
it.
014:015
If
ye
love
me,
keep
my
commandments.
014:016
And
I
will
pray
the
Father,
and
he
shall
give
you
another
Comforter,
that
he
may
abide
with
you
for
ever;
014:017
Even
the
Spirit
of
truth;
whom
the
world
cannot
receive,
because
it
seeth
him
not,
neither
knoweth
him:
but
ye
know
him;
for
he
dwelleth
with
you,
and
shall
be
in
you.
014:018
I
will
not
leave
you
comfortless:
I
will
come
to
you.
014:019
Yet
a
little
while,
and
the
world
seeth
me
no
more;
but
ye
see
me:
because
I
live,
ye
shall
live
also.
014:020
At
that
day
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
in
my
Father,
and
ye
in
me,
and
I
in
you.
014:021
He
that
hath
my
commandments,
and
keepeth
them,
he
it
is
that
loveth
me:
and
he
that
loveth
me
shall
be
loved
of
my
Father,
and
I
will
love
him,
and
will
manifest
myself
to
him.
014:022
Judas
saith
unto
him,
not
Iscariot,
Lord,
how
is
it
that
thou
wilt
manifest
thyself
unto
us,
and
not
unto
the
world?
014:023
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him,
If
a
man
love
me,
he
will
keep
my
words:
and
my
Father
will
love
him,
and
we
will
come
unto
him,
and
make
our
abode
with
him.
014:024
He
that
loveth
me
not
keepeth
not
my
sayings:
and
the
word
which
ye
hear
is
not
mine,
but
the
Father's
which
sent
me.
014:025
These
things
have
I
spoken
unto
you,
being
yet
present
with
you.
014:026
But
the
Comforter,
which
is
the
Holy
Ghost,
whom
the
Father
will
send
in
my
name,
he
shall
teach
you
all
things,
and
bring
all
things
to
your
remembrance,
whatsoever
I
have
said
unto
you.
014:027
Peace
I
leave
with
you,
my
peace
I
give
unto
you:
not
as
the
world
giveth,
give
I
unto
you.
Let
not
your
heart
be
troubled,
neither
let
it
be
afraid.
014:028
Ye
have
heard
how
I
said
unto
you,
I
go
away,
and
come
again
unto
you.
If
ye
loved
me,
ye
would
rejoice,
because
I
said,
I
go
unto
the
Father:
for
my
Father
is
greater
than
I.
014:029
And
now
I
have
told
you
before
it
come
to
pass,
that,
when
it
is
come
to
pass,
ye
might
believe.
014:030
Hereafter
I
will
not
talk
much
with
you:
for
the
prince
of
this
world
cometh,
and
hath
nothing
in
me.
014:031
But
that
the
world
may
know
that
I
love
the
Father;
and
as
the
Father
gave
me
commandment,
even
so
I
do.
Arise,
let
us
go
hence.
015:001
I
am
the
true
vine,
and
my
Father
is
the
husbandman.
015:002
Every
branch
in
me
that
beareth
not
fruit
he
taketh
away:
and
every
branch
that
beareth
fruit,
he
purgeth
it,
that
it
may
bring
forth
more
fruit.
015:003
Now
ye
are
clean
through
the
word
which
I
have
spoken
unto
you.
015:004
Abide
in
me,
and
I
in
you.
As
the
branch
cannot
bear
fruit
of
itself,
except
it
abide
in
the
vine;
no
more
can
ye,
except
ye
abide
in
me.
015:005
I
am
the
vine,
ye
are
the
branches:
He
that
abideth
in
me,
and
I
in
him,
the
same
bringeth
forth
much
fruit:
for
without
me
ye
can
do
nothing.
015:006
If
a
man
abide
not
in
me,
he
is
cast
forth
as
a
branch,
and
is
withered;
and
men
gather
them,
and
cast
them
into
the
fire,
and
they
are
burned.
015:007
If
ye
abide
in
me,
and
my
words
abide
in
you,
ye
shall
ask
what
ye
will,
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
you.
015:008
Herein
is
my
Father
glorified,
that
ye
bear
much
fruit;
so
shall
ye
be
my
disciples.
015:009
As
the
Father
hath
loved
me,
so
have
I
loved
you:
continue
ye
in
my
love.
015:010
If
ye
keep
my
commandments,
ye
shall
abide
in
my
love;
even
as
I
have
kept
my
Father's
commandments,
and
abide
in
his
love.
015:011
These
things
have
I
spoken
unto
you,
that
my
joy
might
remain
in
you,
and
that
your
joy
might
be
full.
015:012
This
is
my
commandment,
That
ye
love
one
another,
as
I
have
loved
you.
015:013
Greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this,
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends.
015:014
Ye
are
my
friends,
if
ye
do
whatsoever
I
command
you.
015:015
Henceforth
I
call
you
not
servants;
for
the
servant
knoweth
not
what
his
lord
doeth:
but
I
have
called
you
friends;
for
all
things
that
I
have
heard
of
my
Father
I
have
made
known
unto
you.
015:016
Ye
have
not
chosen
me,
but
I
have
chosen
you,
and
ordained
you,
that
ye
should
go
and
bring
forth
fruit,
and
that
your
fruit
should
remain:
that
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
of
the
Father
in
my
name,
he
may
give
it
you.
015:017
These
things
I
command
you,
that
ye
love
one
another.
015:018
If
the
world
hate
you,
ye
know
that
it
hated
me
before
it
hated
you.
015:019
If
ye
were
of
the
world,
the
world
would
love
his
own:
but
because
ye
are
not
of
the
world,
but
I
have
chosen
you
out
of
the
world,
therefore
the
world
hateth
you.
015:020
Remember
the
word
that
I
said
unto
you,
The
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord.
If
they
have
persecuted
me,
they
will
also
persecute
you;
if
they
have
kept
my
saying,
they
will
keep
yours
also.
015:021
But
all
these
things
will
they
do
unto
you
for
my
name's
sake,
because
they
know
not
him
that
sent
me.
015:022
If
I
had
not
come
and
spoken
unto
them,
they
had
not
had
sin:
but
now
they
have
no
cloak
for
their
sin.
015:023
He
that
hateth
me
hateth
my
Father
also.
015:024
If
I
had
not
done
among
them
the
works
which
none
other
man
did,
they
had
not
had
sin:
but
now
have
they
both
seen
and
hated
both
me
and
my
Father.
015:025
But
this
cometh
to
pass,
that
the
word
might
be
fulfilled
that
is
written
in
their
law,
They
hated
me
without
a
cause.
015:026
But
when
the
Comforter
is
come,
whom
I
will
send
unto
you
from
the
Father,
even
the
Spirit
of
truth,
which
proceedeth
from
the
Father,
he
shall
testify
of
me:
015:027
And
ye
also
shall
bear
witness,
because
ye
have
been
with
me
from
the
beginning.
016:001
These
things
have
I
spoken
unto
you,
that
ye
should
not
be
offended.
016:002
They
shall
put
you
out
of
the
synagogues:
yea,
the
time
cometh,
that
whosoever
killeth
you
will
think
that
he
doeth
God
service.
016:003
And
these
things
will
they
do
unto
you,
because
they
have
not
known
the
Father,
nor
me.
016:004
But
these
things
have
I
told
you,
that
when
the
time
shall
come,
ye
may
remember
that
I
told
you
of
them.
And
these
things
I
said
not
unto
you
at
the
beginning,
because
I
was
with
you.
016:005
But
now
I
go
my
way
to
him
that
sent
me;
and
none
of
you
asketh
me,
Whither
goest
thou?
016:006
But
because
I
have
said
these
things
unto
you,
sorrow
hath
filled
your
heart.
016:007
Nevertheless
I
tell
you
the
truth;
It
is
expedient
for
you
that
I
go
away:
for
if
I
go
not
away,
the
Comforter
will
not
come
unto
you;
but
if
I
depart,
I
will
send
him
unto
you.
016:008
And
when
he
is
come,
he
will
reprove
the
world
of
sin,
and
of
righteousness,
and
of
judgment:
016:009
Of
sin,
because
they
believe
not
on
me;
016:010
Of
righteousness,
because
I
go
to
my
Father,
and
ye
see
me
no
more;
016:011
Of
judgment,
because
the
prince
of
this
world
is
judged.
016:012
I
have
yet
many
things
to
say
unto
you,
but
ye
cannot
bear
them
now.
016:013
Howbeit
when
he,
the
Spirit
of
truth,
is
come,
he
will
guide
you
into
all
truth:
for
he
shall
not
speak
of
himself;
but
whatsoever
he
shall
hear,
that
shall
he
speak:
and
he
will
shew
you
things
to
come.
016:014
He
shall
glorify
me:
for
he
shall
receive
of
mine,
and
shall
shew
it
unto
you.
016:015
All
things
that
the
Father
hath
are
mine:
therefore
said
I,
that
he
shall
take
of
mine,
and
shall
shew
it
unto
you.
016:016
A
little
while,
and
ye
shall
not
see
me:
and
again,
a
little
while,
and
ye
shall
see
me,
because
I
go
to
the
Father.
016:017
Then
said
some
of
his
disciples
among
themselves,
What
is
this
that
he
saith
unto
us,
A
little
while,
and
ye
shall
not
see
me:
and
again,
a
little
while,
and
ye
shall
see
me:
and,
Because
I
go
to
the
Father?
016:018
They
said
therefore,
What
is
this
that
he
saith,
A
little
while?
we
cannot
tell
what
he
saith.
016:019
Now
Jesus
knew
that
they
were
desirous
to
ask
him,
and
said
unto
them,
Do
ye
enquire
among
yourselves
of
that
I
said,
A
little
while,
and
ye
shall
not
see
me:
and
again,
a
little
while,
and
ye
shall
see
me?
016:020
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
That
ye
shall
weep
and
lament,
but
the
world
shall
rejoice:
and
ye
shall
be
sorrowful,
but
your
sorrow
shall
be
turned
into
joy.
016:021
A
woman
when
she
is
in
travail
hath
sorrow,
because
her
hour
is
come:
but
as
soon
as
she
is
delivered
of
the
child,
she
remembereth
no
more
the
anguish,
for
joy
that
a
man
is
born
into
the
world.
016:022
And
ye
now
therefore
have
sorrow:
but
I
will
see
you
again,
and
your
heart
shall
rejoice,
and
your
joy
no
man
taketh
from
you.
016:023
And
in
that
day
ye
shall
ask
me
nothing.
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
you,
Whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
the
Father
in
my
name,
he
will
give
it
you.
016:024
Hitherto
have
ye
asked
nothing
in
my
name:
ask,
and
ye
shall
receive,
that
your
joy
may
be
full.
016:025
These
things
have
I
spoken
unto
you
in
proverbs:
but
the
time
cometh,
when
I
shall
no
more
speak
unto
you
in
proverbs,
but
I
shall
shew
you
plainly
of
the
Father.
016:026
At
that
day
ye
shall
ask
in
my
name:
and
I
say
not
unto
you,
that
I
will
pray
the
Father
for
you:
016:027
For
the
Father
himself
loveth
you,
because
ye
have
loved
me,
and
have
believed
that
I
came
out
from
God.
016:028
I
came
forth
from
the
Father,
and
am
come
into
the
world:
again,
I
leave
the
world,
and
go
to
the
Father.
016:029
His
disciples
said
unto
him,
Lo,
now
speakest
thou
plainly,
and
speakest
no
proverb.
016:030
Now
are
we
sure
that
thou
knowest
all
things,
and
needest
not
that
any
man
should
ask
thee:
by
this
we
believe
that
thou
camest
forth
from
God.
016:031
Jesus
answered
them,
Do
ye
now
believe?
016:032
Behold,
the
hour
cometh,
yea,
is
now
come,
that
ye
shall
be
scattered,
every
man
to
his
own,
and
shall
leave
me
alone:
and
yet
I
am
not
alone,
because
the
Father
is
with
me.
016:033
These
things
I
have
spoken
unto
you,
that
in
me
ye
might
have
peace.
In
the
world
ye
shall
have
tribulation:
but
be
of
good
cheer;
I
have
overcome
the
world.
017:001
These
words
spake
Jesus,
and
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
heaven,
and
said,
Father,
the
hour
is
come;
glorify
thy
Son,
that
thy
Son
also
may
glorify
thee:
017:002
As
thou
hast
given
him
power
over
all
flesh,
that
he
should
give
eternal
life
to
as
many
as
thou
hast
given
him.
017:003
And
this
is
life
eternal,
that
they
might
know
thee
the
only
true
God,
and
Jesus
Christ,
whom
thou
hast
sent.
017:004
I
have
glorified
thee
on
the
earth:
I
have
finished
the
work
which
thou
gavest
me
to
do.
017:005
And
now,
O
Father,
glorify
thou
me
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
I
had
with
thee
before
the
world
was.
017:006
I
have
manifested
thy
name
unto
the
men
which
thou
gavest
me
out
of
the
world:
thine
they
were,
and
thou
gavest
them
me;
and
they
have
kept
thy
word.
017:007
Now
they
have
known
that
all
things
whatsoever
thou
hast
given
me
are
of
thee.
017:008
For
I
have
given
unto
them
the
words
which
thou
gavest
me;
and
they
have
received
them,
and
have
known
surely
that
I
came
out
from
thee,
and
they
have
believed
that
thou
didst
send
me.
017:009
I
pray
for
them:
I
pray
not
for
the
world,
but
for
them
which
thou
hast
given
me;
for
they
are
thine.
017:010
And
all
mine
are
thine,
and
thine
are
mine;
and
I
am
glorified
in
them.
017:011
And
now
I
am
no
more
in
the
world,
but
these
are
in
the
world,
and
I
come
to
thee.
Holy
Father,
keep
through
thine
own
name
those
whom
thou
hast
given
me,
that
they
may
be
one,
as
we
are.
017:012
While
I
was
with
them
in
the
world,
I
kept
them
in
thy
name:
those
that
thou
gavest
me
I
have
kept,
and
none
of
them
is
lost,
but
the
son
of
perdition;
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled.
017:013
And
now
come
I
to
thee;
and
these
things
I
speak
in
the
world,
that
they
might
have
my
joy
fulfilled
in
themselves.
017:014
I
have
given
them
thy
word;
and
the
world
hath
hated
them,
because
they
are
not
of
the
world,
even
as
I
am
not
of
the
world.
017:015
I
pray
not
that
thou
shouldest
take
them
out
of
the
world,
but
that
thou
shouldest
keep
them
from
the
evil.
017:016
They
are
not
of
the
world,
even
as
I
am
not
of
the
world.
017:017
Sanctify
them
through
thy
truth:
thy
word
is
truth.
017:018
As
thou
hast
sent
me
into
the
world,
even
so
have
I
also
sent
them
into
the
world.
017:019
And
for
their
sakes
I
sanctify
myself,
that
they
also
might
be
sanctified
through
the
truth.
017:020
Neither
pray
I
for
these
alone,
but
for
them
also
which
shall
believe
on
me
through
their
word;
017:021
That
they
all
may
be
one;
as
thou,
Father,
art
in
me,
and
I
in
thee,
that
they
also
may
be
one
in
us:
that
the
world
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me.
017:022
And
the
glory
which
thou
gavest
me
I
have
given
them;
that
they
may
be
one,
even
as
we
are
one:
017:023
I
in
them,
and
thou
in
me,
that
they
may
be
made
perfect
in
one;
and
that
the
world
may
know
that
thou
hast
sent
me,
and
hast
loved
them,
as
thou
hast
loved
me.
017:024
Father,
I
will
that
they
also,
whom
thou
hast
given
me,
be
with
me
where
I
am;
that
they
may
behold
my
glory,
which
thou
hast
given
me:
for
thou
lovedst
me
before
the
foundation
of
the
world.
017:025
O
righteous
Father,
the
world
hath
not
known
thee:
but
I
have
known
thee,
and
these
have
known
that
thou
hast
sent
me.
017:026
And
I
have
declared
unto
them
thy
name,
and
will
declare
it:
that
the
love
wherewith
