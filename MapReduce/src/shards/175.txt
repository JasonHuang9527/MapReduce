thou
hast
loved
me
may
be
in
them,
and
I
in
them.
018:001
When
Jesus
had
spoken
these
words,
he
went
forth
with
his
disciples
over
the
brook
Cedron,
where
was
a
garden,
into
the
which
he
entered,
and
his
disciples.
018:002
And
Judas
also,
which
betrayed
him,
knew
the
place:
for
Jesus
ofttimes
resorted
thither
with
his
disciples.
018:003
Judas
then,
having
received
a
band
of
men
and
officers
from
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees,
cometh
thither
with
lanterns
and
torches
and
weapons.
018:004
Jesus
therefore,
knowing
all
things
that
should
come
upon
him,
went
forth,
and
said
unto
them,
Whom
seek
ye?
018:005
They
answered
him,
Jesus
of
Nazareth.
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
I
am
he.
And
Judas
also,
which
betrayed
him,
stood
with
them.
018:006
As
soon
then
as
he
had
said
unto
them,
I
am
he,
they
went
backward,
and
fell
to
the
ground.
018:007
Then
asked
he
them
again,
Whom
seek
ye?
And
they
said,
Jesus
of
Nazareth.
018:008
Jesus
answered,
I
have
told
you
that
I
am
he:
if
therefore
ye
seek
me,
let
these
go
their
way:
018:009
That
the
saying
might
be
fulfilled,
which
he
spake,
Of
them
which
thou
gavest
me
have
I
lost
none.
018:010
Then
Simon
Peter
having
a
sword
drew
it,
and
smote
the
high
priest's
servant,
and
cut
off
his
right
ear.
The
servant's
name
was
Malchus.
018:011
Then
said
Jesus
unto
Peter,
Put
up
thy
sword
into
the
sheath:
the
cup
which
my
Father
hath
given
me,
shall
I
not
drink
it?
018:012
Then
the
band
and
the
captain
and
officers
of
the
Jews
took
Jesus,
and
bound
him,
018:013
And
led
him
away
to
Annas
first;
for
he
was
father
in
law
to
Caiaphas,
which
was
the
high
priest
that
same
year.
018:014
Now
Caiaphas
was
he,
which
gave
counsel
to
the
Jews,
that
it
was
expedient
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
people.
018:015
And
Simon
Peter
followed
Jesus,
and
so
did
another
disciple:
that
disciple
was
known
unto
the
high
priest,
and
went
in
with
Jesus
into
the
palace
of
the
high
priest.
018:016
But
Peter
stood
at
the
door
without.
Then
went
out
that
other
disciple,
which
was
known
unto
the
high
priest,
and
spake
unto
her
that
kept
the
door,
and
brought
in
Peter.
018:017
Then
saith
the
damsel
that
kept
the
door
unto
Peter,
Art
not
thou
also
one
of
this
man's
disciples?
He
saith,
I
am
not.
018:018
And
the
servants
and
officers
stood
there,
who
had
made
a
fire
of
coals;
for
it
was
cold:
and
they
warmed
themselves:
and
Peter
stood
with
them,
and
warmed
himself.
018:019
The
high
priest
then
asked
Jesus
of
his
disciples,
and
of
his
doctrine.
018:020
Jesus
answered
him,
I
spake
openly
to
the
world;
I
ever
taught
in
the
synagogue,
and
in
the
temple,
whither
the
Jews
always
resort;
and
in
secret
have
I
said
nothing.
018:021
Why
askest
thou
me?
ask
them
which
heard
me,
what
I
have
said
unto
them:
behold,
they
know
what
I
said.
018:022
And
when
he
had
thus
spoken,
one
of
the
officers
which
stood
by
struck
Jesus
with
the
palm
of
his
hand,
saying,
Answerest
thou
the
high
priest
so?
018:023
Jesus
answered
him,
If
I
have
spoken
evil,
bear
witness
of
the
evil:
but
if
well,
why
smitest
thou
me?
018:024
Now
Annas
had
sent
him
bound
unto
Caiaphas
the
high
priest.
018:025
And
Simon
Peter
stood
and
warmed
himself.
They
said
therefore
unto
him,
Art
not
thou
also
one
of
his
disciples?
He
denied
it,
and
said,
I
am
not.
018:026
One
of
the
servants
of
the
high
priest,
being
his
kinsman
whose
ear
Peter
cut
off,
saith,
Did
not
I
see
thee
in
the
garden
with
him?
018:027
Peter
then
denied
again:
and
immediately
the
cock
crew.
018:028
Then
led
they
Jesus
from
Caiaphas
unto
the
hall
of
judgment:
and
it
was
early;
and
they
themselves
went
not
into
the
judgment
hall,
lest
they
should
be
defiled;
but
that
they
might
eat
the
passover.
018:029
Pilate
then
went
out
unto
them,
and
said,
What
accusation
bring
ye
against
this
man?
018:030
They
answered
and
said
unto
him,
If
he
were
not
a
malefactor,
we
would
not
have
delivered
him
up
unto
thee.
018:031
Then
said
Pilate
unto
them,
Take
ye
him,
and
judge
him
according
to
your
law.
The
Jews
therefore
said
unto
him,
It
is
not
lawful
for
us
to
put
any
man
to
death:
018:032
That
the
saying
of
Jesus
might
be
fulfilled,
which
he
spake,
signifying
what
death
he
should
die.
018:033
Then
Pilate
entered
into
the
judgment
hall
again,
and
called
Jesus,
and
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
the
King
of
the
Jews?
018:034
Jesus
answered
him,
Sayest
thou
this
thing
of
thyself,
or
did
others
tell
it
thee
of
me?
018:035
Pilate
answered,
Am
I
a
Jew?
Thine
own
nation
and
the
chief
priests
have
delivered
thee
unto
me:
what
hast
thou
done?
018:036
Jesus
answered,
My
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world:
if
my
kingdom
were
of
this
world,
then
would
my
servants
fight,
that
I
should
not
be
delivered
to
the
Jews:
but
now
is
my
kingdom
not
from
hence.
018:037
Pilate
therefore
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
a
king
then?
Jesus
answered,
Thou
sayest
that
I
am
a
king.
To
this
end
was
I
born,
and
for
this
cause
came
I
into
the
world,
that
I
should
bear
witness
unto
the
truth.
Every
one
that
is
of
the
truth
heareth
my
voice.
018:038
Pilate
saith
unto
him,
What
is
truth?
And
when
he
had
said
this,
he
went
out
again
unto
the
Jews,
and
saith
unto
them,
I
find
in
him
no
fault
at
all.
018:039
But
ye
have
a
custom,
that
I
should
release
unto
you
one
at
the
passover:
will
ye
therefore
that
I
release
unto
you
the
King
of
the
Jews?
018:040
Then
cried
they
all
again,
saying,
Not
this
man,
but
Barabbas.
Now
Barabbas
was
a
robber.
019:001
Then
Pilate
therefore
took
Jesus,
and
scourged
him.
019:002
And
the
soldiers
platted
a
crown
of
thorns,
and
put
it
on
his
head,
and
they
put
on
him
a
purple
robe,
019:003
And
said,
Hail,
King
of
the
Jews!
and
they
smote
him
with
their
hands.
019:004
Pilate
therefore
went
forth
again,
and
saith
unto
them,
Behold,
I
bring
him
forth
to
you,
that
ye
may
know
that
I
find
no
fault
in
him.
019:005
Then
came
Jesus
forth,
wearing
the
crown
of
thorns,
and
the
purple
robe.
And
Pilate
saith
unto
them,
Behold
the
man!
019:006
When
the
chief
priests
therefore
and
officers
saw
him,
they
cried
out,
saying,
Crucify
him,
crucify
him.
Pilate
saith
unto
them,
Take
ye
him,
and
crucify
him:
for
I
find
no
fault
in
him.
019:007
The
Jews
answered
him,
We
have
a
law,
and
by
our
law
he
ought
to
die,
because
he
made
himself
the
Son
of
God.
019:008
When
Pilate
therefore
heard
that
saying,
he
was
the
more
afraid;
019:009
And
went
again
into
the
judgment
hall,
and
saith
unto
Jesus,
Whence
art
thou?
But
Jesus
gave
him
no
answer.
019:010
Then
saith
Pilate
unto
him,
Speakest
thou
not
unto
me?
knowest
thou
not
that
I
have
power
to
crucify
thee,
and
have
power
to
release
thee?
019:011
Jesus
answered,
Thou
couldest
have
no
power
at
all
against
me,
except
it
were
given
thee
from
above:
therefore
he
that
delivered
me
unto
thee
hath
the
greater
sin.
019:012
And
from
thenceforth
Pilate
sought
to
release
him:
but
the
Jews
cried
out,
saying,
If
thou
let
this
man
go,
thou
art
not
Caesar's
friend:
whosoever
maketh
himself
a
king
speaketh
against
Caesar.
019:013
When
Pilate
therefore
heard
that
saying,
he
brought
Jesus
forth,
and
sat
down
in
the
judgment
seat
in
a
place
that
is
called
the
Pavement,
but
in
the
Hebrew,
Gabbatha.
019:014
And
it
was
the
preparation
of
the
passover,
and
about
the
sixth
hour:
and
he
saith
unto
the
Jews,
Behold
your
King!
019:015
But
they
cried
out,
Away
with
him,
away
with
him,
crucify
him.
Pilate
saith
unto
them,
Shall
I
crucify
your
King?
The
chief
priests
answered,
We
have
no
king
but
Caesar.
019:016
Then
delivered
he
him
therefore
unto
them
to
be
crucified.
And
they
took
Jesus,
and
led
him
away.
019:017
And
he
bearing
his
cross
went
forth
into
a
place
called
the
place
of
a
skull,
which
is
called
in
the
Hebrew
Golgotha:
019:018
Where
they
crucified
him,
and
two
other
with
him,
on
either
side
one,
and
Jesus
in
the
midst.
019:019
And
Pilate
wrote
a
title,
and
put
it
on
the
cross.
And
the
writing
was
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
THE
KING
OF
THE
JEWS.
019:020
This
title
then
read
many
of
the
Jews:
for
the
place
where
Jesus
was
crucified
was
nigh
to
the
city:
and
it
was
written
in
Hebrew,
and
Greek,
and
Latin.
019:021
Then
said
the
chief
priests
of
the
Jews
to
Pilate,
Write
not,
The
King
of
the
Jews;
but
that
he
said,
I
am
King
of
the
Jews.
019:022
Pilate
answered,
What
I
have
written
I
have
written.
019:023
Then
the
soldiers,
when
they
had
crucified
Jesus,
took
his
garments,
and
made
four
parts,
to
every
soldier
a
part;
and
also
his
coat:
now
the
coat
was
without
seam,
woven
from
the
top
throughout.
019:024
They
said
therefore
among
themselves,
Let
us
not
rend
it,
but
cast
lots
for
it,
whose
it
shall
be:
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled,
which
saith,
They
parted
my
raiment
among
them,
and
for
my
vesture
they
did
cast
lots.
These
things
therefore
the
soldiers
did.
019:025
Now
there
stood
by
the
cross
of
Jesus
his
mother,
and
his
mother's
sister,
Mary
the
wife
of
Cleophas,
and
Mary
Magdalene.
019:026
When
Jesus
therefore
saw
his
mother,
and
the
disciple
standing
by,
whom
he
loved,
he
saith
unto
his
mother,
Woman,
behold
thy
son!
019:027
Then
saith
he
to
the
disciple,
Behold
thy
mother!
And
from
that
hour
that
disciple
took
her
unto
his
own
home.
019:028
After
this,
Jesus
knowing
that
all
things
were
now
accomplished,
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled,
saith,
I
thirst.
019:029
Now
there
was
set
a
vessel
full
of
vinegar:
and
they
filled
a
spunge
with
vinegar,
and
put
it
upon
hyssop,
and
put
it
to
his
mouth.
019:030
When
Jesus
therefore
had
received
the
vinegar,
he
said,
It
is
finished:
and
he
bowed
his
head,
and
gave
up
the
ghost.
019:031
The
Jews
therefore,
because
it
was
the
preparation,
that
the
bodies
should
not
remain
upon
the
cross
on
the
sabbath
day,
(for
that
sabbath
day
was
an
high
day,)
besought
Pilate
that
their
legs
might
be
broken,
and
that
they
might
be
taken
away.
019:032
Then
came
the
soldiers,
and
brake
the
legs
of
the
first,
and
of
the
other
which
was
crucified
with
him.
019:033
But
when
they
came
to
Jesus,
and
saw
that
he
was
dead
already,
they
brake
not
his
legs:
019:034
But
one
of
the
soldiers
with
a
spear
pierced
his
side,
and
forthwith
came
there
out
blood
and
water.
019:035
And
he
that
saw
it
bare
record,
and
his
record
is
true:
and
he
knoweth
that
he
saith
true,
that
ye
might
believe.
019:036
For
these
things
were
done,
that
the
scripture
should
be
fulfilled,
A
bone
of
him
shall
not
be
broken.
019:037
And
again
another
scripture
saith,
They
shall
look
on
him
whom
they
pierced.
019:038
And
after
this
Joseph
of
Arimathaea,
being
a
disciple
of
Jesus,
but
secretly
for
fear
of
the
Jews,
besought
Pilate
that
he
might
take
away
the
body
of
Jesus:
and
Pilate
gave
him
leave.
He
came
therefore,
and
took
the
body
of
Jesus.
019:039
And
there
came
also
Nicodemus,
which
at
the
first
came
to
Jesus
by
night,
and
brought
a
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes,
about
an
hundred
pound
weight.
019:040
Then
took
they
the
body
of
Jesus,
and
wound
it
in
linen
clothes
with
the
spices,
as
the
manner
of
the
Jews
is
to
bury.
019:041
Now
in
the
place
where
he
was
crucified
there
was
a
garden;
and
in
the
garden
a
new
sepulchre,
wherein
was
never
man
yet
laid.
019:042
There
laid
they
Jesus
therefore
because
of
the
Jews'
preparation
day;
for
the
sepulchre
was
nigh
at
hand.
020:001
The
first
day
of
the
week
cometh
Mary
Magdalene
early,
when
it
was
yet
dark,
unto
the
sepulchre,
and
seeth
the
stone
taken
away
from
the
sepulchre.
020:002
Then
she
runneth,
and
cometh
to
Simon
Peter,
and
to
the
other
disciple,
whom
Jesus
loved,
and
saith
unto
them,
They
have
taken
away
the
LORD
out
of
the
sepulchre,
and
we
know
not
where
they
have
laid
him.
020:003
Peter
therefore
went
forth,
and
that
other
disciple,
and
came
to
the
sepulchre.
020:004
So
they
ran
both
together:
and
the
other
disciple
did
outrun
Peter,
and
came
first
to
the
sepulchre.
020:005
And
he
stooping
down,
and
looking
in,
saw
the
linen
clothes
lying;
yet
went
he
not
in.
020:006
Then
cometh
Simon
Peter
following
him,
and
went
into
the
sepulchre,
and
seeth
the
linen
clothes
lie,
020:007
And
the
napkin,
that
was
about
his
head,
not
lying
with
the
linen
clothes,
but
wrapped
together
in
a
place
by
itself.
020:008
Then
went
in
also
that
other
disciple,
which
came
first
to
the
sepulchre,
and
he
saw,
and
believed.
020:009
For
as
yet
they
knew
not
the
scripture,
that
he
must
rise
again
from
the
dead.
020:010
Then
the
disciples
went
away
again
unto
their
own
home.
020:011
But
Mary
stood
without
at
the
sepulchre
weeping:
and
as
she
wept,
she
stooped
down,
and
looked
into
the
sepulchre,
020:012
And
seeth
two
angels
in
white
sitting,
the
one
at
the
head,
and
the
other
at
the
feet,
where
the
body
of
Jesus
had
lain.
020:013
And
they
say
unto
her,
Woman,
why
weepest
thou?
She
saith
unto
them,
Because
they
have
taken
away
my
LORD,
and
I
know
not
where
they
have
laid
him.
020:014
And
when
she
had
thus
said,
she
turned
herself
back,
and
saw
Jesus
standing,
and
knew
not
that
it
was
Jesus.
020:015
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Woman,
why
weepest
thou?
whom
seekest
thou?
She,
supposing
him
to
be
the
gardener,
saith
unto
him,
Sir,
if
thou
have
borne
him
hence,
tell
me
where
thou
hast
laid
him,
and
I
will
take
him
away.
020:016
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Mary.
She
turned
herself,
and
saith
unto
him,
Rabboni;
which
is
to
say,
Master.
020:017
Jesus
saith
unto
her,
Touch
me
not;
for
I
am
not
yet
ascended
to
my
Father:
but
go
to
my
brethren,
and
say
unto
them,
I
ascend
unto
my
Father,
and
your
Father;
and
to
my
God,
and
your
God.
020:018
Mary
Magdalene
came
and
told
the
disciples
that
she
had
seen
the
LORD,
and
that
he
had
spoken
these
things
unto
her.
020:019
Then
the
same
day
at
evening,
being
the
first
day
of
the
week,
when
the
doors
were
shut
where
the
disciples
were
assembled
for
fear
of
the
Jews,
came
Jesus
and
stood
in
the
midst,
and
saith
unto
them,
Peace
be
unto
you.
020:020
And
when
he
had
so
said,
he
shewed
unto
them
his
hands
and
his
side.
Then
were
the
disciples
glad,
when
they
saw
the
LORD.
020:021
Then
said
Jesus
to
them
again,
Peace
be
unto
you:
as
my
Father
hath
sent
me,
even
so
send
I
you.
020:022
And
when
he
had
said
this,
he
breathed
on
them,
and
saith
unto
them,
Receive
ye
the
Holy
Ghost:
020:023
Whose
soever
sins
ye
remit,
they
are
remitted
unto
them;
and
whose
soever
sins
ye
retain,
they
are
retained.
020:024
But
Thomas,
one
of
the
twelve,
called
Didymus,
was
not
with
them
when
Jesus
came.
020:025
The
other
disciples
therefore
said
unto
him,
We
have
seen
the
LORD.
But
he
said
unto
them,
Except
I
shall
see
in
his
hands
the
print
of
the
nails,
and
put
my
finger
into
the
print
of
the
nails,
and
thrust
my
hand
into
his
side,
I
will
not
believe.
020:026
And
after
eight
days
again
his
disciples
were
within,
and
Thomas
with
them:
then
came
Jesus,
the
doors
being
shut,
and
stood
in
the
midst,
and
said,
Peace
be
unto
you.
020:027
Then
saith
he
to
Thomas,
Reach
hither
thy
finger,
and
behold
my
hands;
and
reach
hither
thy
hand,
and
thrust
it
into
my
side:
and
be
not
faithless,
but
believing.
020:028
And
Thomas
answered
and
said
unto
him,
My
LORD
and
my
God.
020:029
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
Thomas,
because
thou
hast
seen
me,
thou
hast
believed:
blessed
are
they
that
have
not
seen,
and
yet
have
believed.
020:030
And
many
other
signs
truly
did
Jesus
in
the
presence
of
his
disciples,
which
are
not
written
in
this
book:
020:031
But
these
are
written,
that
ye
might
believe
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ,
the
Son
of
God;
and
that
believing
ye
might
have
life
through
his
name.
021:001
After
these
things
Jesus
shewed
himself
again
to
the
disciples
at
the
sea
of
Tiberias;
and
on
this
wise
shewed
he
himself.
021:002
There
were
together
Simon
Peter,
and
Thomas
called
Didymus,
and
Nathanael
of
Cana
in
Galilee,
and
the
sons
of
Zebedee,
and
two
other
of
his
disciples.
021:003
Simon
Peter
saith
unto
them,
I
go
a
fishing.
They
say
unto
him,
We
also
go
with
thee.
They
went
forth,
and
entered
into
a
ship
immediately;
and
that
night
they
caught
nothing.
021:004
But
when
the
morning
was
now
come,
Jesus
stood
on
the
shore:
but
the
disciples
knew
not
that
it
was
Jesus.
021:005
Then
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Children,
have
ye
any
meat?
They
answered
him,
No.
021:006
And
he
said
unto
them,
Cast
the
net
on
the
right
side
of
the
ship,
and
ye
shall
find.
They
cast
therefore,
and
now
they
were
not
able
to
draw
it
for
the
multitude
of
fishes.
021:007
Therefore
that
disciple
whom
Jesus
loved
saith
unto
Peter,
It
is
the
Lord.
Now
when
Simon
Peter
heard
that
it
was
the
Lord,
he
girt
his
fisher's
coat
unto
him,
(for
he
was
naked,)
and
did
cast
himself
into
the
sea.
021:008
And
the
other
disciples
came
in
a
little
ship;
(for
they
were
not
far
from
land,
but
as
it
were
two
hundred
cubits,)
dragging
the
net
with
fishes.
021:009
As
soon
then
as
they
were
come
to
land,
they
saw
a
fire
of
coals
there,
and
fish
laid
thereon,
and
bread.
021:010
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Bring
of
the
fish
which
ye
have
now
caught.
021:011
Simon
Peter
went
up,
and
drew
the
net
to
land
full
of
great
fishes,
an
hundred
and
fifty
and
three:
and
for
all
there
were
so
many,
yet
was
not
the
net
broken.
021:012
Jesus
saith
unto
them,
Come
and
dine.
And
none
of
the
disciples
durst
ask
him,
Who
art
thou?
knowing
that
it
was
the
Lord.
021:013
Jesus
then
cometh,
and
taketh
bread,
and
giveth
them,
and
fish
likewise.
021:014
This
is
now
the
third
time
that
Jesus
shewed
himself
to
his
disciples,
after
that
he
was
risen
from
the
dead.
021:015
So
when
they
had
dined,
Jesus
saith
to
Simon
Peter,
Simon,
son
of
Jonas,
lovest
thou
me
more
than
these?
He
saith
unto
him,
Yea,
Lord;
thou
knowest
that
I
love
thee.
He
saith
unto
him,
Feed
my
lambs.
021:016
He
saith
to
him
again
the
second
time,
Simon,
son
of
Jonas,
lovest
thou
me?
He
saith
unto
him,
Yea,
Lord;
thou
knowest
that
I
love
thee.
He
saith
unto
him,
Feed
my
sheep.
021:017
He
saith
unto
him
the
third
time,
Simon,
son
of
Jonas,
lovest
thou
me?
Peter
was
grieved
because
he
said
unto
him
the
third
time,
Lovest
thou
me?
And
he
said
unto
him,
Lord,
thou
knowest
all
things;
thou
knowest
that
I
love
thee.
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
Feed
my
sheep.
021:018
Verily,
verily,
I
say
unto
thee,
When
thou
wast
young,
thou
girdest
thyself,
and
walkedst
whither
thou
wouldest:
but
when
thou
shalt
be
old,
thou
shalt
stretch
forth
thy
hands,
and
another
shall
gird
thee,
and
carry
thee
whither
thou
wouldest
not.
021:019
This
spake
he,
signifying
by
what
death
he
should
glorify
God.
And
when
he
had
spoken
this,
he
saith
unto
him,
Follow
me.
021:020
Then
Peter,
turning
about,
seeth
the
disciple
whom
Jesus
loved
following;
which
also
leaned
on
his
breast
at
supper,
and
said,
Lord,
which
is
he
that
betrayeth
thee?
021:021
Peter
seeing
him
saith
to
Jesus,
Lord,
and
what
shall
this
man
do?
021:022
Jesus
saith
unto
him,
If
I
will
that
he
tarry
till
I
come,
what
is
that
to
thee?
follow
thou
me.
021:023
Then
went
this
saying
abroad
among
the
brethren,
that
that
disciple
should
not
die:
yet
Jesus
said
not
unto
him,
He
shall
not
die;
but,
If
I
will
that
he
tarry
till
I
come,
what
is
that
to
thee?
021:024
This
is
the
disciple
which
testifieth
of
these
things,
and
wrote
these
things:
and
we
know
that
his
testimony
is
true.
021:025
And
there
are
also
many
other
things
which
Jesus
did,
the
which,
if
they
should
be
written
every
one,
I
suppose
that
even
the
world
itself
could
not
contain
the
books
that
should
be
written.
Amen.
Book
44	Acts
001:001
The
former
treatise
have
I
made,
O
Theophilus,
of
all
that
Jesus
began
both
to
do
and
teach,
001:002
Until
the
day
in
which
he
was
taken
up,
after
that
he
through
the
Holy
Ghost
had
given
commandments
unto
the
apostles
whom
he
had
chosen:
001:003
To
whom
also
he
shewed
himself
alive
after
his
passion
by
many
infallible
proofs,
being
seen
of
them
forty
days,
and
speaking
of
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
God:
001:004
And,
being
assembled
together
with
them,
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
depart
from
Jerusalem,
but
wait
for
the
promise
of
the
Father,
which,
saith
he,
ye
have
heard
of
me.
001:005
For
John
truly
baptized
with
water;
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
Holy
Ghost
not
many
days
hence.
001:006
When
they
therefore
were
come
together,
they
asked
of
him,
saying,
Lord,
wilt
thou
at
this
time
restore
again
the
kingdom
to
Israel?
001:007
And
he
said
unto
them,
It
is
not
for
you
to
know
the
times
or
the
seasons,
which
the
Father
hath
put
in
his
own
power.
001:008
But
ye
shall
receive
power,
after
that
the
Holy
Ghost
is
come
upon
you:
and
ye
shall
be
witnesses
unto
me
both
in
Jerusalem,
and
in
all
Judaea,
and
in
Samaria,
and
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
earth.
001:009
And
when
he
had
spoken
these
things,
while
they
beheld,
he
was
taken
up;
and
a
cloud
received
him
out
of
their
sight.
001:010
And
while
they
looked
stedfastly
toward
heaven
as
he
went
up,
behold,
two
men
stood
by
them
in
white
apparel;
001:011
Which
also
said,
Ye
men
of
Galilee,
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
heaven?
this
same
Jesus,
which
is
taken
up
from
you
into
heaven,
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
have
seen
him
go
into
heaven.
001:012
Then
returned
they
unto
Jerusalem
from
the
mount
called
Olivet,
which
is
from
Jerusalem
a
sabbath
day's
journey.
001:013
And
when
they
were
come
in,
they
went
up
into
an
upper
room,
where
abode
both
Peter,
and
James,
and
John,
and
Andrew,
Philip,
and
Thomas,
Bartholomew,
and
Matthew,
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus,
and
Simon
Zelotes,
and
Judas
the
brother
of
James.
001:014
These
all
continued
with
one
accord
in
prayer
and
supplication,
with
the
women,
and
Mary
the
mother
of
Jesus,
and
with
his
brethren.
001:015
And
in
those
days
Peter
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
disciples,
and
said,
(the
number
of
names
together
were
about
an
hundred
and
twenty,)
001:016
Men
and
brethren,
this
scripture
must
needs
have
been
fulfilled,
which
the
Holy
Ghost
by
the
mouth
of
David
spake
before
concerning
Judas,
which
was
guide
to
them
that
took
Jesus.
001:017
For
he
was
numbered
with
us,
and
had
obtained
part
of
this
ministry.
001:018
Now
this
man
purchased
a
field
with
the
reward
of
iniquity;
and
falling
headlong,
he
burst
asunder
in
the
midst,
and
all
his
bowels
gushed
out.
001:019
And
it
was
known
unto
all
the
dwellers
at
Jerusalem;
insomuch
as
that
field
is
called
in
their
proper
tongue,
Aceldama,
that
is
to
say,
The
field
of
blood.
001:020
For
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
Psalms,
Let
his
habitation
be
desolate,
and
let
no
man
dwell
therein:
and
