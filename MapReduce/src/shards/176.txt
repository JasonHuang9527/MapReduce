his
bishoprick
let
another
take.
001:021
Wherefore
of
these
men
which
have
companied
with
us
all
the
time
that
the
Lord
Jesus
went
in
and
out
among
us,
001:022
Beginning
from
the
baptism
of
John,
unto
that
same
day
that
he
was
taken
up
from
us,
must
one
be
ordained
to
be
a
witness
with
us
of
his
resurrection.
001:023
And
they
appointed
two,
Joseph
called
Barsabas,
who
was
surnamed
Justus,
and
Matthias.
001:024
And
they
prayed,
and
said,
Thou,
Lord,
which
knowest
the
hearts
of
all
men,
shew
whether
of
these
two
thou
hast
chosen,
001:025
That
he
may
take
part
of
this
ministry
and
apostleship,
from
which
Judas
by
transgression
fell,
that
he
might
go
to
his
own
place.
001:026
And
they
gave
forth
their
lots;
and
the
lot
fell
upon
Matthias;
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
eleven
apostles.
002:001
And
when
the
day
of
Pentecost
was
fully
come,
they
were
all
with
one
accord
in
one
place.
002:002
And
suddenly
there
came
a
sound
from
heaven
as
of
a
rushing
mighty
wind,
and
it
filled
all
the
house
where
they
were
sitting.
002:003
And
there
appeared
unto
them
cloven
tongues
like
as
of
fire,
and
it
sat
upon
each
of
them.
002:004
And
they
were
all
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost,
and
began
to
speak
with
other
tongues,
as
the
Spirit
gave
them
utterance.
002:005
And
there
were
dwelling
at
Jerusalem
Jews,
devout
men,
out
of
every
nation
under
heaven.
002:006
Now
when
this
was
noised
abroad,
the
multitude
came
together,
and
were
confounded,
because
that
every
man
heard
them
speak
in
his
own
language.
002:007
And
they
were
all
amazed
and
marvelled,
saying
one
to
another,
Behold,
are
not
all
these
which
speak
Galilaeans?
002:008
And
how
hear
we
every
man
in
our
own
tongue,
wherein
we
were
born?
002:009
Parthians,
and
Medes,
and
Elamites,
and
the
dwellers
in
Mesopotamia,
and
in
Judaea,
and
Cappadocia,
in
Pontus,
and
Asia,
002:010
Phrygia,
and
Pamphylia,
in
Egypt,
and
in
the
parts
of
Libya
about
Cyrene,
and
strangers
of
Rome,
Jews
and
proselytes,
002:011
Cretes
and
Arabians,
we
do
hear
them
speak
in
our
tongues
the
wonderful
works
of
God.
002:012
And
they
were
all
amazed,
and
were
in
doubt,
saying
one
to
another,
What
meaneth
this?
002:013
Others
mocking
said,
These
men
are
full
of
new
wine.
002:014
But
Peter,
standing
up
with
the
eleven,
lifted
up
his
voice,
and
said
unto
them,
Ye
men
of
Judaea,
and
all
ye
that
dwell
at
Jerusalem,
be
this
known
unto
you,
and
hearken
to
my
words:
002:015
For
these
are
not
drunken,
as
ye
suppose,
seeing
it
is
but
the
third
hour
of
the
day.
002:016
But
this
is
that
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
Joel;
002:017
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days,
saith
God,
I
will
pour
out
of
my
Spirit
upon
all
flesh:
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
shall
prophesy,
and
your
young
men
shall
see
visions,
and
your
old
men
shall
dream
dreams:
002:018
And
on
my
servants
and
on
my
handmaidens
I
will
pour
out
in
those
days
of
my
Spirit;
and
they
shall
prophesy:
002:019
And
I
will
shew
wonders
in
heaven
above,
and
signs
in
the
earth
beneath;
blood,
and
fire,
and
vapour
of
smoke:
002:020
The
sun
shall
be
turned
into
darkness,
and
the
moon
into
blood,
before
the
great
and
notable
day
of
the
Lord
come:
002:021
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
whosoever
shall
call
on
the
name
of
the
Lord
shall
be
saved.
002:022
Ye
men
of
Israel,
hear
these
words;
Jesus
of
Nazareth,
a
man
approved
of
God
among
you
by
miracles
and
wonders
and
signs,
which
God
did
by
him
in
the
midst
of
you,
as
ye
yourselves
also
know:
002:023
Him,
being
delivered
by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
God,
ye
have
taken,
and
by
wicked
hands
have
crucified
and
slain:
002:024
Whom
God
hath
raised
up,
having
loosed
the
pains
of
death:
because
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
be
holden
of
it.
002:025
For
David
speaketh
concerning
him,
I
foresaw
the
Lord
always
before
my
face,
for
he
is
on
my
right
hand,
that
I
should
not
be
moved:
002:026
Therefore
did
my
heart
rejoice,
and
my
tongue
was
glad;
moreover
also
my
flesh
shall
rest
in
hope:
002:027
Because
thou
wilt
not
leave
my
soul
in
hell,
neither
wilt
thou
suffer
thine
Holy
One
to
see
corruption.
002:028
Thou
hast
made
known
to
me
the
ways
of
life;
thou
shalt
make
me
full
of
joy
with
thy
countenance.
002:029
Men
and
brethren,
let
me
freely
speak
unto
you
of
the
patriarch
David,
that
he
is
both
dead
and
buried,
and
his
sepulchre
is
with
us
unto
this
day.
002:030
Therefore
being
a
prophet,
and
knowing
that
God
had
sworn
with
an
oath
to
him,
that
of
the
fruit
of
his
loins,
according
to
the
flesh,
he
would
raise
up
Christ
to
sit
on
his
throne;
002:031
He
seeing
this
before
spake
of
the
resurrection
of
Christ,
that
his
soul
was
not
left
in
hell,
neither
his
flesh
did
see
corruption.
002:032
This
Jesus
hath
God
raised
up,
whereof
we
all
are
witnesses.
002:033
Therefore
being
by
the
right
hand
of
God
exalted,
and
having
received
of
the
Father
the
promise
of
the
Holy
Ghost,
he
hath
shed
forth
this,
which
ye
now
see
and
hear.
002:034
For
David
is
not
ascended
into
the
heavens:
but
he
saith
himself,
The
Lord
said
unto
my
Lord,
Sit
thou
on
my
right
hand,
002:035
Until
I
make
thy
foes
thy
footstool.
002:036
Therefore
let
all
the
house
of
Israel
know
assuredly,
that
God
hath
made
the
same
Jesus,
whom
ye
have
crucified,
both
Lord
and
Christ.
002:037
Now
when
they
heard
this,
they
were
pricked
in
their
heart,
and
said
unto
Peter
and
to
the
rest
of
the
apostles,
Men
and
brethren,
what
shall
we
do?
002:038
Then
Peter
said
unto
them,
Repent,
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
for
the
remission
of
sins,
and
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
Holy
Ghost.
002:039
For
the
promise
is
unto
you,
and
to
your
children,
and
to
all
that
are
afar
off,
even
as
many
as
the
LORD
our
God
shall
call.
002:040
And
with
many
other
words
did
he
testify
and
exhort,
saying,
Save
yourselves
from
this
untoward
generation.
002:041
Then
they
that
gladly
received
his
word
were
baptized:
and
the
same
day
there
were
added
unto
them
about
three
thousand
souls.
002:042
And
they
continued
stedfastly
in
the
apostles'
doctrine
and
fellowship,
and
in
breaking
of
bread,
and
in
prayers.
002:043
And
fear
came
upon
every
soul:
and
many
wonders
and
signs
were
done
by
the
apostles.
002:044
And
all
that
believed
were
together,
and
had
all
things
common;
002:045
And
sold
their
possessions
and
goods,
and
parted
them
to
all
men,
as
every
man
had
need.
002:046
And
they,
continuing
daily
with
one
accord
in
the
temple,
and
breaking
bread
from
house
to
house,
did
eat
their
meat
with
gladness
and
singleness
of
heart,
002:047
Praising
God,
and
having
favour
with
all
the
people.
And
the
Lord
added
to
the
church
daily
such
as
should
be
saved.
003:001
Now
Peter
and
John
went
up
together
into
the
temple
at
the
hour
of
prayer,
being
the
ninth
hour.
003:002
And
a
certain
man
lame
from
his
mother's
womb
was
carried,
whom
they
laid
daily
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
which
is
called
Beautiful,
to
ask
alms
of
them
that
entered
into
the
temple;
003:003
Who
seeing
Peter
and
John
about
to
go
into
the
temple
asked
an
alms.
003:004
And
Peter,
fastening
his
eyes
upon
him
with
John,
said,
Look
on
us.
003:005
And
he
gave
heed
unto
them,
expecting
to
receive
something
of
them.
003:006
Then
Peter
said,
Silver
and
gold
have
I
none;
but
such
as
I
have
give
I
thee:
In
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Nazareth
rise
up
and
walk.
003:007
And
he
took
him
by
the
right
hand,
and
lifted
him
up:
and
immediately
his
feet
and
ankle
bones
received
strength.
003:008
And
he
leaping
up
stood,
and
walked,
and
entered
with
them
into
the
temple,
walking,
and
leaping,
and
praising
God.
003:009
And
all
the
people
saw
him
walking
and
praising
God:
003:010
And
they
knew
that
it
was
he
which
sat
for
alms
at
the
Beautiful
gate
of
the
temple:
and
they
were
filled
with
wonder
and
amazement
at
that
which
had
happened
unto
him.
003:011
And
as
the
lame
man
which
was
healed
held
Peter
and
John,
all
the
people
ran
together
unto
them
in
the
porch
that
is
called
Solomon's,
greatly
wondering.
003:012
And
when
Peter
saw
it,
he
answered
unto
the
people,
Ye
men
of
Israel,
why
marvel
ye
at
this?
or
why
look
ye
so
earnestly
on
us,
as
though
by
our
own
power
or
holiness
we
had
made
this
man
to
walk?
003:013
The
God
of
Abraham,
and
of
Isaac,
and
of
Jacob,
the
God
of
our
fathers,
hath
glorified
his
Son
Jesus;
whom
ye
delivered
up,
and
denied
him
in
the
presence
of
Pilate,
when
he
was
determined
to
let
him
go.
003:014
But
ye
denied
the
Holy
One
and
the
Just,
and
desired
a
murderer
to
be
granted
unto
you;
003:015
And
killed
the
Prince
of
life,
whom
God
hath
raised
from
the
dead;
whereof
we
are
witnesses.
003:016
And
his
name
through
faith
in
his
name
hath
made
this
man
strong,
whom
ye
see
and
know:
yea,
the
faith
which
is
by
him
hath
given
him
this
perfect
soundness
in
the
presence
of
you
all.
003:017
And
now,
brethren,
I
wot
that
through
ignorance
ye
did
it,
as
did
also
your
rulers.
003:018
But
those
things,
which
God
before
had
shewed
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets,
that
Christ
should
suffer,
he
hath
so
fulfilled.
003:019
Repent
ye
therefore,
and
be
converted,
that
your
sins
may
be
blotted
out,
when
the
times
of
refreshing
shall
come
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord.
003:020
And
he
shall
send
Jesus
Christ,
which
before
was
preached
unto
you:
003:021
Whom
the
heaven
must
receive
until
the
times
of
restitution
of
all
things,
which
God
hath
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
holy
prophets
since
the
world
began.
003:022
For
Moses
truly
said
unto
the
fathers,
A
prophet
shall
the
Lord
your
God
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren,
like
unto
me;
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you.
003:023
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
every
soul,
which
will
not
hear
that
prophet,
shall
be
destroyed
from
among
the
people.
003:024
Yea,
and
all
the
prophets
from
Samuel
and
those
that
follow
after,
as
many
as
have
spoken,
have
likewise
foretold
of
these
days.
003:025
Ye
are
the
children
of
the
prophets,
and
of
the
covenant
which
God
made
with
our
fathers,
saying
unto
Abraham,
And
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed.
003:026
Unto
you
first
God,
having
raised
up
his
Son
Jesus,
sent
him
to
bless
you,
in
turning
away
every
one
of
you
from
his
iniquities.
004:001
And
as
they
spake
unto
the
people,
the
priests,
and
the
captain
of
the
temple,
and
the
Sadducees,
came
upon
them,
004:002
Being
grieved
that
they
taught
the
people,
and
preached
through
Jesus
the
resurrection
from
the
dead.
004:003
And
they
laid
hands
on
them,
and
put
them
in
hold
unto
the
next
day:
for
it
was
now
eventide.
004:004
Howbeit
many
of
them
which
heard
the
word
believed;
and
the
number
of
the
men
was
about
five
thousand.
004:005
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
their
rulers,
and
elders,
and
scribes,
004:006
And
Annas
the
high
priest,
and
Caiaphas,
and
John,
and
Alexander,
and
as
many
as
were
of
the
kindred
of
the
high
priest,
were
gathered
together
at
Jerusalem.
004:007
And
when
they
had
set
them
in
the
midst,
they
asked,
By
what
power,
or
by
what
name,
have
ye
done
this?
004:008
Then
Peter,
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost,
said
unto
them,
Ye
rulers
of
the
people,
and
elders
of
Israel,
004:009
If
we
this
day
be
examined
of
the
good
deed
done
to
the
impotent
man,
by
what
means
he
is
made
whole;
004:010
Be
it
known
unto
you
all,
and
to
all
the
people
of
Israel,
that
by
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Nazareth,
whom
ye
crucified,
whom
God
raised
from
the
dead,
even
by
him
doth
this
man
stand
here
before
you
whole.
004:011
This
is
the
stone
which
was
set
at
nought
of
you
builders,
which
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner.
004:012
Neither
is
there
salvation
in
any
other:
for
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men,
whereby
we
must
be
saved.
004:013
Now
when
they
saw
the
boldness
of
Peter
and
John,
and
perceived
that
they
were
unlearned
and
ignorant
men,
they
marvelled;
and
they
took
knowledge
of
them,
that
they
had
been
with
Jesus.
004:014
And
beholding
the
man
which
was
healed
standing
with
them,
they
could
say
nothing
against
it.
004:015
But
when
they
had
commanded
them
to
go
aside
out
of
the
council,
they
conferred
among
themselves,
004:016
Saying,
What
shall
we
do
to
these
men?
for
that
indeed
a
notable
miracle
hath
been
done
by
them
is
manifest
to
all
them
that
dwell
in
Jerusalem;
and
we
cannot
deny
it.
004:017
But
that
it
spread
no
further
among
the
people,
let
us
straitly
threaten
them,
that
they
speak
henceforth
to
no
man
in
this
name.
004:018
And
they
called
them,
and
commanded
them
not
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
Jesus.
004:019
But
Peter
and
John
answered
and
said
unto
them,
Whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
God
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
God,
judge
ye.
004:020
For
we
cannot
but
speak
the
things
which
we
have
seen
and
heard.
004:021
So
when
they
had
further
threatened
them,
they
let
them
go,
finding
nothing
how
they
might
punish
them,
because
of
the
people:
for
all
men
glorified
God
for
that
which
was
done.
004:022
For
the
man
was
above
forty
years
old,
on
whom
this
miracle
of
healing
was
shewed.
004:023
And
being
let
go,
they
went
to
their
own
company,
and
reported
all
that
the
chief
priests
and
elders
had
said
unto
them.
004:024
And
when
they
heard
that,
they
lifted
up
their
voice
to
God
with
one
accord,
and
said,
Lord,
thou
art
God,
which
hast
made
heaven,
and
earth,
and
the
sea,
and
all
that
in
them
is:
004:025
Who
by
the
mouth
of
thy
servant
David
hast
said,
Why
did
the
heathen
rage,
and
the
people
imagine
vain
things?
004:026
The
kings
of
the
earth
stood
up,
and
the
rulers
were
gathered
together
against
the
Lord,
and
against
his
Christ.
004:027
For
of
a
truth
against
thy
holy
child
Jesus,
whom
thou
hast
anointed,
both
Herod,
and
Pontius
Pilate,
with
the
Gentiles,
and
the
people
of
Israel,
were
gathered
together,
004:028
For
to
do
whatsoever
thy
hand
and
thy
counsel
determined
before
to
be
done.
004:029
And
now,
Lord,
behold
their
threatenings:
and
grant
unto
thy
servants,
that
with
all
boldness
they
may
speak
thy
word,
004:030
By
stretching
forth
thine
hand
to
heal;
and
that
signs
and
wonders
may
be
done
by
the
name
of
thy
holy
child
Jesus.
004:031
And
when
they
had
prayed,
the
place
was
shaken
where
they
were
assembled
together;
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost,
and
they
spake
the
word
of
God
with
boldness.
004:032
And
the
multitude
of
them
that
believed
were
of
one
heart
and
of
one
soul:
neither
said
any
of
them
that
ought
of
the
things
which
he
possessed
was
his
own;
but
they
had
all
things
common.
004:033
And
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
witness
of
the
resurrection
of
the
Lord
Jesus:
and
great
grace
was
upon
them
all.
004:034
Neither
was
there
any
among
them
that
lacked:
for
as
many
as
were
possessors
of
lands
or
houses
sold
them,
and
brought
the
prices
of
the
things
that
were
sold,
004:035
And
laid
them
down
at
the
apostles'
feet:
and
distribution
was
made
unto
every
man
according
as
he
had
need.
004:036
And
Joses,
who
by
the
apostles
was
surnamed
Barnabas,
(which
is,
being
interpreted,
The
son
of
consolation,)
a
Levite,
and
of
the
country
of
Cyprus,
004:037
Having
land,
sold
it,
and
brought
the
money,
and
laid
it
at
the
apostles'
feet.
005:001
But
a
certain
man
named
Ananias,
with
Sapphira
his
wife,
sold
a
possession,
005:002
And
kept
back
part
of
the
price,
his
wife
also
being
privy
to
it,
and
brought
a
certain
part,
and
laid
it
at
the
apostles'
feet.
005:003
But
Peter
said,
Ananias,
why
hath
Satan
filled
thine
heart
to
lie
to
the
Holy
Ghost,
and
to
keep
back
part
of
the
price
of
the
land?
005:004
Whiles
it
remained,
was
it
not
thine
own?
and
after
it
was
sold,
was
it
not
in
thine
own
power?
why
hast
thou
conceived
this
thing
in
thine
heart?
thou
hast
not
lied
unto
men,
but
unto
God.
005:005
And
Ananias
hearing
these
words
fell
down,
and
gave
up
the
ghost:
and
great
fear
came
on
all
them
that
heard
these
things.
005:006
And
the
young
men
arose,
wound
him
up,
and
carried
him
out,
and
buried
him.
005:007
And
it
was
about
the
space
of
three
hours
after,
when
his
wife,
not
knowing
what
was
done,
came
in.
005:008
And
Peter
answered
unto
her,
Tell
me
whether
ye
sold
the
land
for
so
much?
And
she
said,
Yea,
for
so
much.
005:009
Then
Peter
said
unto
her,
How
is
it
that
ye
have
agreed
together
to
tempt
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord?
behold,
the
feet
of
them
which
have
buried
thy
husband
are
at
the
door,
and
shall
carry
thee
out.
005:010
Then
fell
she
down
straightway
at
his
feet,
and
yielded
up
the
ghost:
and
the
young
men
came
in,
and
found
her
dead,
and,
carrying
her
forth,
buried
her
by
her
husband.
005:011
And
great
fear
came
upon
all
the
church,
and
upon
as
many
as
heard
these
things.
005:012
And
by
the
hands
of
the
apostles
were
many
signs
and
wonders
wrought
among
the
people;
(and
they
were
all
with
one
accord
in
Solomon's
porch.
005:013
And
of
the
rest
durst
no
man
join
himself
to
them:
but
the
people
magnified
them.
005:014
And
believers
were
the
more
added
to
the
Lord,
multitudes
both
of
men
and
women.)
005:015
Insomuch
that
they
brought
forth
the
sick
into
the
streets,
and
laid
them
on
beds
and
couches,
that
at
the
least
the
shadow
of
Peter
passing
by
might
overshadow
some
of
them.
005:016
There
came
also
a
multitude
out
of
the
cities
round
about
unto
Jerusalem,
bringing
sick
folks,
and
them
which
were
vexed
with
unclean
spirits:
and
they
were
healed
every
one.
005:017
Then
the
high
priest
rose
up,
and
all
they
that
were
with
him,
(which
is
the
sect
of
the
Sadducees,)
and
were
filled
with
indignation,
005:018
And
laid
their
hands
on
the
apostles,
and
put
them
in
the
common
prison.
005:019
But
the
angel
of
the
Lord
by
night
opened
the
prison
doors,
and
brought
them
forth,
and
said,
005:020
Go,
stand
and
speak
in
the
temple
to
the
people
all
the
words
of
this
life.
005:021
And
when
they
heard
that,
they
entered
into
the
temple
early
in
the
morning,
and
taught.
But
the
high
priest
came,
and
they
that
were
with
him,
and
called
the
council
together,
and
all
the
senate
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
sent
to
the
prison
to
have
them
brought.
005:022
But
when
the
officers
came,
and
found
them
not
in
the
prison,
they
returned
and
told,
005:023
Saying,
The
prison
truly
found
we
shut
with
all
safety,
and
the
keepers
standing
without
before
the
doors:
but
when
we
had
opened,
we
found
no
man
within.
005:024
Now
when
the
high
priest
and
the
captain
of
the
temple
and
the
chief
priests
heard
these
things,
they
doubted
of
them
whereunto
this
would
grow.
005:025
Then
came
one
and
told
them,
saying,
Behold,
the
men
whom
ye
put
in
prison
are
standing
in
the
temple,
and
teaching
the
people.
005:026
Then
went
the
captain
with
the
officers,
and
brought
them
without
violence:
for
they
feared
the
people,
lest
they
should
have
been
stoned.
005:027
And
when
they
had
brought
them,
they
set
them
before
the
council:
and
the
high
priest
asked
them,
005:028
Saying,
Did
not
we
straitly
command
you
that
ye
should
not
teach
in
this
name?
and,
behold,
ye
have
filled
Jerusalem
with
your
doctrine,
and
intend
to
bring
this
man's
blood
upon
us.
005:029
Then
Peter
and
the
other
apostles
answered
and
said,
We
ought
to
obey
God
rather
than
men.
005:030
The
God
of
our
fathers
raised
up
Jesus,
whom
ye
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree.
005:031
Him
hath
God
exalted
with
his
right
hand
to
be
a
Prince
and
a
Saviour,
for
to
give
repentance
to
Israel,
and
forgiveness
of
sins.
005:032
And
we
are
his
witnesses
of
these
things;
and
so
is
also
the
Holy
Ghost,
whom
God
hath
given
to
them
that
obey
him.
005:033
When
they
heard
that,
they
were
cut
to
the
heart,
and
took
counsel
to
slay
them.
005:034
Then
stood
there
up
one
in
the
council,
a
Pharisee,
named
Gamaliel,
a
doctor
of
the
law,
had
in
reputation
among
all
the
people,
and
commanded
to
put
the
apostles
forth
a
little
space;
005:035
And
said
unto
them,
Ye
men
of
Israel,
take
heed
to
yourselves
what
ye
intend
to
do
as
touching
these
men.
005:036
For
before
these
days
rose
up
Theudas,
boasting
himself
to
be
somebody;
to
whom
a
number
of
men,
about
four
hundred,
joined
themselves:
who
was
slain;
and
all,
as
many
as
obeyed
him,
were
scattered,
and
brought
to
nought.
005:037
After
this
man
rose
up
Judas
of
Galilee
in
the
days
of
the
taxing,
and
drew
away
much
people
after
him:
he
also
perished;
and
all,
even
as
many
as
obeyed
him,
were
dispersed.
005:038
And
now
I
say
unto
you,
Refrain
from
these
men,
and
let
them
alone:
for
if
this
counsel
or
this
work
be
of
men,
it
will
come
to
nought:
005:039
But
if
it
be
of
God,
ye
cannot
overthrow
it;
lest
haply
ye
be
found
even
to
fight
against
God.
005:040
And
to
him
they
agreed:
and
when
they
had
called
the
apostles,
and
beaten
them,
they
commanded
that
they
should
not
speak
in
the
name
of
Jesus,
and
let
them
go.
005:041
And
they
departed
from
the
presence
of
the
council,
rejoicing
that
they
were
counted
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
his
name.
005:042
And
daily
in
the
temple,
and
in
every
house,
they
ceased
not
to
teach
and
preach
Jesus
Christ.
006:001
And
in
those
days,
when
the
number
of
the
disciples
was
multiplied,
there
arose
a
murmuring
of
the
Grecians
against
the
Hebrews,
because
their
widows
were
neglected
in
the
daily
ministration.
006:002
Then
the
twelve
called
the
multitude
of
the
disciples
unto
them,
and
said,
It
is
not
reason
that
we
should
leave
the
word
of
God,
and
serve
tables.
006:003
Wherefore,
brethren,
look
ye
out
among
you
seven
men
of
honest
report,
full
of
the
Holy
Ghost
and
wisdom,
whom
we
may
appoint
over
this
business.
006:004
But
we
will
give
ourselves
continually
to
prayer,
and
to
the
ministry
of
the
word.
006:005
And
the
saying
pleased
the
whole
multitude:
and
they
chose
Stephen,
a
man
full
of
faith
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost,
and
Philip,
and
Prochorus,
and
Nicanor,
and
Timon,
and
Parmenas,
and
Nicolas
a
proselyte
of
Antioch:
006:006
Whom
they
set
before
the
apostles:
and
when
they
had
prayed,
they
laid
their
hands
on
them.
006:007
And
the
word
of
God
increased;
and
the
number
of
the
disciples
multiplied
in
Jerusalem
greatly;
and
a
great
company
of
the
priests
were
obedient
to
the
faith.
006:008
And
Stephen,
full
of
faith
and
power,
did
great
wonders
and
miracles
among
the
people.
006:009
Then
there
arose
certain
of
the
synagogue,
which
is
called
the
synagogue
of
the
Libertines,
and
Cyrenians,
and
Alexandrians,
and
of
them
of
Cilicia
and
of
Asia,
disputing
with
Stephen.
006:010
And
they
were
not
able
to
resist
the
wisdom
and
the
spirit
by
which
he
spake.
006:011
Then
they
