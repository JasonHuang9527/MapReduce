suborned
men,
which
said,
We
have
heard
him
speak
blasphemous
words
against
Moses,
and
against
God.
006:012
And
they
stirred
up
the
people,
and
the
elders,
and
the
scribes,
and
came
upon
him,
and
caught
him,
and
brought
him
to
the
council,
006:013
And
set
up
false
witnesses,
which
said,
This
man
ceaseth
not
to
speak
blasphemous
words
against
this
holy
place,
and
the
law:
006:014
For
we
have
heard
him
say,
that
this
Jesus
of
Nazareth
shall
destroy
this
place,
and
shall
change
the
customs
which
Moses
delivered
us.
006:015
And
all
that
sat
in
the
council,
looking
stedfastly
on
him,
saw
his
face
as
it
had
been
the
face
of
an
angel.
007:001
Then
said
the
high
priest,
Are
these
things
so?
007:002
And
he
said,
Men,
brethren,
and
fathers,
hearken;
The
God
of
glory
appeared
unto
our
father
Abraham,
when
he
was
in
Mesopotamia,
before
he
dwelt
in
Charran,
007:003
And
said
unto
him,
Get
thee
out
of
thy
country,
and
from
thy
kindred,
and
come
into
the
land
which
I
shall
shew
thee.
007:004
Then
came
he
out
of
the
land
of
the
Chaldaeans,
and
dwelt
in
Charran:
and
from
thence,
when
his
father
was
dead,
he
removed
him
into
this
land,
wherein
ye
now
dwell.
007:005
And
he
gave
him
none
inheritance
in
it,
no,
not
so
much
as
to
set
his
foot
on:
yet
he
promised
that
he
would
give
it
to
him
for
a
possession,
and
to
his
seed
after
him,
when
as
yet
he
had
no
child.
007:006
And
God
spake
on
this
wise,
That
his
seed
should
sojourn
in
a
strange
land;
and
that
they
should
bring
them
into
bondage,
and
entreat
them
evil
four
hundred
years.
007:007
And
the
nation
to
whom
they
shall
be
in
bondage
will
I
judge,
said
God:
and
after
that
shall
they
come
forth,
and
serve
me
in
this
place.
007:008
And
he
gave
him
the
covenant
of
circumcision:
and
so
Abraham
begat
Isaac,
and
circumcised
him
the
eighth
day;
and
Isaac
begat
Jacob;
and
Jacob
begat
the
twelve
patriarchs.
007:009
And
the
patriarchs,
moved
with
envy,
sold
Joseph
into
Egypt:
but
God
was
with
him,
007:010
And
delivered
him
out
of
all
his
afflictions,
and
gave
him
favour
and
wisdom
in
the
sight
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt;
and
he
made
him
governor
over
Egypt
and
all
his
house.
007:011
Now
there
came
a
dearth
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt
and
Chanaan,
and
great
affliction:
and
our
fathers
found
no
sustenance.
007:012
But
when
Jacob
heard
that
there
was
corn
in
Egypt,
he
sent
out
our
fathers
first.
007:013
And
at
the
second
time
Joseph
was
made
known
to
his
brethren;
and
Joseph's
kindred
was
made
known
unto
Pharaoh.
007:014
Then
sent
Joseph,
and
called
his
father
Jacob
to
him,
and
all
his
kindred,
threescore
and
fifteen
souls.
007:015
So
Jacob
went
down
into
Egypt,
and
died,
he,
and
our
fathers,
007:016
And
were
carried
over
into
Sychem,
and
laid
in
the
sepulchre
that
Abraham
bought
for
a
sum
of
money
of
the
sons
of
Emmor
the
father
of
Sychem.
007:017
But
when
the
time
of
the
promise
drew
nigh,
which
God
had
sworn
to
Abraham,
the
people
grew
and
multiplied
in
Egypt,
007:018
Till
another
king
arose,
which
knew
not
Joseph.
007:019
The
same
dealt
subtilly
with
our
kindred,
and
evil
entreated
our
fathers,
so
that
they
cast
out
their
young
children,
to
the
end
they
might
not
live.
007:020
In
which
time
Moses
was
born,
and
was
exceeding
fair,
and
nourished
up
in
his
father's
house
three
months:
007:021
And
when
he
was
cast
out,
Pharaoh's
daughter
took
him
up,
and
nourished
him
for
her
own
son.
007:022
And
Moses
was
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
Egyptians,
and
was
mighty
in
words
and
in
deeds.
007:023
And
when
he
was
full
forty
years
old,
it
came
into
his
heart
to
visit
his
brethren
the
children
of
Israel.
007:024
And
seeing
one
of
them
suffer
wrong,
he
defended
him,
and
avenged
him
that
was
oppressed,
and
smote
the
Egyptian:
007:025
For
he
supposed
his
brethren
would
have
understood
how
that
God
by
his
hand
would
deliver
them:
but
they
understood
not.
007:026
And
the
next
day
he
shewed
himself
unto
them
as
they
strove,
and
would
have
set
them
at
one
again,
saying,
Sirs,
ye
are
brethren;
why
do
ye
wrong
one
to
another?
007:027
But
he
that
did
his
neighbour
wrong
thrust
him
away,
saying,
Who
made
thee
a
ruler
and
a
judge
over
us?
007:028
Wilt
thou
kill
me,
as
thou
diddest
the
Egyptian
yesterday?
007:029
Then
fled
Moses
at
this
saying,
and
was
a
stranger
in
the
land
of
Madian,
where
he
begat
two
sons.
007:030
And
when
forty
years
were
expired,
there
appeared
to
him
in
the
wilderness
of
mount
Sina
an
angel
of
the
Lord
in
a
flame
of
fire
in
a
bush.
007:031
When
Moses
saw
it,
he
wondered
at
the
sight:
and
as
he
drew
near
to
behold
it,
the
voice
of
the
LORD
came
unto
him,
007:032
Saying,
I
am
the
God
of
thy
fathers,
the
God
of
Abraham,
and
the
God
of
Isaac,
and
the
God
of
Jacob.
Then
Moses
trembled,
and
durst
not
behold.
007:033
Then
said
the
Lord
to
him,
Put
off
thy
shoes
from
thy
feet:
for
the
place
where
thou
standest
is
holy
ground.
007:034
I
have
seen,
I
have
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
which
is
in
Egypt,
and
I
have
heard
their
groaning,
and
am
come
down
to
deliver
them.
And
now
come,
I
will
send
thee
into
Egypt.
007:035
This
Moses
whom
they
refused,
saying,
Who
made
thee
a
ruler
and
a
judge?
the
same
did
God
send
to
be
a
ruler
and
a
deliverer
by
the
hand
of
the
angel
which
appeared
to
him
in
the
bush.
007:036
He
brought
them
out,
after
that
he
had
shewed
wonders
and
signs
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
in
the
Red
sea,
and
in
the
wilderness
forty
years.
007:037
This
is
that
Moses,
which
said
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
A
prophet
shall
the
Lord
your
God
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren,
like
unto
me;
him
shall
ye
hear.
007:038
This
is
he,
that
was
in
the
church
in
the
wilderness
with
the
angel
which
spake
to
him
in
the
mount
Sina,
and
with
our
fathers:
who
received
the
lively
oracles
to
give
unto
us:
007:039
To
whom
our
fathers
would
not
obey,
but
thrust
him
from
them,
and
in
their
hearts
turned
back
again
into
Egypt,
007:040
Saying
unto
Aaron,
Make
us
gods
to
go
before
us:
for
as
for
this
Moses,
which
brought
us
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
him.
007:041
And
they
made
a
calf
in
those
days,
and
offered
sacrifice
unto
the
idol,
and
rejoiced
in
the
works
of
their
own
hands.
007:042
Then
God
turned,
and
gave
them
up
to
worship
the
host
of
heaven;
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
prophets,
O
ye
house
of
Israel,
have
ye
offered
to
me
slain
beasts
and
sacrifices
by
the
space
of
forty
years
in
the
wilderness?
007:043
Yea,
ye
took
up
the
tabernacle
of
Moloch,
and
the
star
of
your
god
Remphan,
figures
which
ye
made
to
worship
them:
and
I
will
carry
you
away
beyond
Babylon.
007:044
Our
fathers
had
the
tabernacle
of
witness
in
the
wilderness,
as
he
had
appointed,
speaking
unto
Moses,
that
he
should
make
it
according
to
the
fashion
that
he
had
seen.
007:045
Which
also
our
fathers
that
came
after
brought
in
with
Jesus
into
the
possession
of
the
Gentiles,
whom
God
drave
out
before
the
face
of
our
fathers,
unto
the
days
of
David;
007:046
Who
found
favour
before
God,
and
desired
to
find
a
tabernacle
for
the
God
of
Jacob.
007:047
But
Solomon
built
him
an
house.
007:048
Howbeit
the
most
High
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands;
as
saith
the
prophet,
007:049
Heaven
is
my
throne,
and
earth
is
my
footstool:
what
house
will
ye
build
me?
saith
the
Lord:
or
what
is
the
place
of
my
rest?
007:050
Hath
not
my
hand
made
all
these
things?
007:051
Ye
stiffnecked
and
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
ears,
ye
do
always
resist
the
Holy
Ghost:
as
your
fathers
did,
so
do
ye.
007:052
Which
of
the
prophets
have
not
your
fathers
persecuted?
and
they
have
slain
them
which
shewed
before
of
the
coming
of
the
Just
One;
of
whom
ye
have
been
now
the
betrayers
and
murderers:
007:053
Who
have
received
the
law
by
the
disposition
of
angels,
and
have
not
kept
it.
007:054
When
they
heard
these
things,
they
were
cut
to
the
heart,
and
they
gnashed
on
him
with
their
teeth.
007:055
But
he,
being
full
of
the
Holy
Ghost,
looked
up
stedfastly
into
heaven,
and
saw
the
glory
of
God,
and
Jesus
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
God,
007:056
And
said,
Behold,
I
see
the
heavens
opened,
and
the
Son
of
man
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
God.
007:057
Then
they
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice,
and
stopped
their
ears,
and
ran
upon
him
with
one
accord,
007:058
And
cast
him
out
of
the
city,
and
stoned
him:
and
the
witnesses
laid
down
their
clothes
at
a
young
man's
feet,
whose
name
was
Saul.
007:059
And
they
stoned
Stephen,
calling
upon
God,
and
saying,
Lord
Jesus,
receive
my
spirit.
007:060
And
he
kneeled
down,
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
Lord,
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge.
And
when
he
had
said
this,
he
fell
asleep.
008:001
And
Saul
was
consenting
unto
his
death.
And
at
that
time
there
was
a
great
persecution
against
the
church
which
was
at
Jerusalem;
and
they
were
all
scattered
abroad
throughout
the
regions
of
Judaea
and
Samaria,
except
the
apostles.
008:002
And
devout
men
carried
Stephen
to
his
burial,
and
made
great
lamentation
over
him.
008:003
As
for
Saul,
he
made
havock
of
the
church,
entering
into
every
house,
and
haling
men
and
women
committed
them
to
prison.
008:004
Therefore
they
that
were
scattered
abroad
went
every
where
preaching
the
word.
008:005
Then
Philip
went
down
to
the
city
of
Samaria,
and
preached
Christ
unto
them.
008:006
And
the
people
with
one
accord
gave
heed
unto
those
things
which
Philip
spake,
hearing
and
seeing
the
miracles
which
he
did.
008:007
For
unclean
spirits,
crying
with
loud
voice,
came
out
of
many
that
were
possessed
with
them:
and
many
taken
with
palsies,
and
that
were
lame,
were
healed.
008:008
And
there
was
great
joy
in
that
city.
008:009
But
there
was
a
certain
man,
called
Simon,
which
beforetime
in
the
same
city
used
sorcery,
and
bewitched
the
people
of
Samaria,
giving
out
that
himself
was
some
great
one:
008:010
To
whom
they
all
gave
heed,
from
the
least
to
the
greatest,
saying,
This
man
is
the
great
power
of
God.
008:011
And
to
him
they
had
regard,
because
that
of
long
time
he
had
bewitched
them
with
sorceries.
008:012
But
when
they
believed
Philip
preaching
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
God,
and
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ,
they
were
baptized,
both
men
and
women.
008:013
Then
Simon
himself
believed
also:
and
when
he
was
baptized,
he
continued
with
Philip,
and
wondered,
beholding
the
miracles
and
signs
which
were
done.
008:014
Now
when
the
apostles
which
were
at
Jerusalem
heard
that
Samaria
had
received
the
word
of
God,
they
sent
unto
them
Peter
and
John:
008:015
Who,
when
they
were
come
down,
prayed
for
them,
that
they
might
receive
the
Holy
Ghost:
008:016
(For
as
yet
he
was
fallen
upon
none
of
them:
only
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus.)
008:017
Then
laid
they
their
hands
on
them,
and
they
received
the
Holy
Ghost.
008:018
And
when
Simon
saw
that
through
laying
on
of
the
apostles'
hands
the
Holy
Ghost
was
given,
he
offered
them
money,
008:019
Saying,
Give
me
also
this
power,
that
on
whomsoever
I
lay
hands,
he
may
receive
the
Holy
Ghost.
008:020
But
Peter
said
unto
him,
Thy
money
perish
with
thee,
because
thou
hast
thought
that
the
gift
of
God
may
be
purchased
with
money.
008:021
Thou
hast
neither
part
nor
lot
in
this
matter:
for
thy
heart
is
not
right
in
the
sight
of
God.
008:022
Repent
therefore
of
this
thy
wickedness,
and
pray
God,
if
perhaps
the
thought
of
thine
heart
may
be
forgiven
thee.
008:023
For
I
perceive
that
thou
art
in
the
gall
of
bitterness,
and
in
the
bond
of
iniquity.
008:024
Then
answered
Simon,
and
said,
Pray
ye
to
the
LORD
for
me,
that
none
of
these
things
which
ye
have
spoken
come
upon
me.
008:025
And
they,
when
they
had
testified
and
preached
the
word
of
the
Lord,
returned
to
Jerusalem,
and
preached
the
gospel
in
many
villages
of
the
Samaritans.
008:026
And
the
angel
of
the
Lord
spake
unto
Philip,
saying,
Arise,
and
go
toward
the
south
unto
the
way
that
goeth
down
from
Jerusalem
unto
Gaza,
which
is
desert.
008:027
And
he
arose
and
went:
and,
behold,
a
man
of
Ethiopia,
an
eunuch
of
great
authority
under
Candace
queen
of
the
Ethiopians,
who
had
the
charge
of
all
her
treasure,
and
had
come
to
Jerusalem
for
to
worship,
008:028
Was
returning,
and
sitting
in
his
chariot
read
Esaias
the
prophet.
008:029
Then
the
Spirit
said
unto
Philip,
Go
near,
and
join
thyself
to
this
chariot.
008:030
And
Philip
ran
thither
to
him,
and
heard
him
read
the
prophet
Esaias,
and
said,
Understandest
thou
what
thou
readest?
008:031
And
he
said,
How
can
I,
except
some
man
should
guide
me?
And
he
desired
Philip
that
he
would
come
up
and
sit
with
him.
008:032
The
place
of
the
scripture
which
he
read
was
this,
He
was
led
as
a
sheep
to
the
slaughter;
and
like
a
lamb
dumb
before
his
shearer,
so
opened
he
not
his
mouth:
008:033
In
his
humiliation
his
judgment
was
taken
away:
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation?
for
his
life
is
taken
from
the
earth.
008:034
And
the
eunuch
answered
Philip,
and
said,
I
pray
thee,
of
whom
speaketh
the
prophet
this?
of
himself,
or
of
some
other
man?
008:035
Then
Philip
opened
his
mouth,
and
began
at
the
same
scripture,
and
preached
unto
him
Jesus.
008:036
And
as
they
went
on
their
way,
they
came
unto
a
certain
water:
and
the
eunuch
said,
See,
here
is
water;
what
doth
hinder
me
to
be
baptized?
008:037
And
Philip
said,
If
thou
believest
with
all
thine
heart,
thou
mayest.
And
he
answered
and
said,
I
believe
that
Jesus
Christ
is
the
Son
of
God.
008:038
And
he
commanded
the
chariot
to
stand
still:
and
they
went
down
both
into
the
water,
both
Philip
and
the
eunuch;
and
he
baptized
him.
008:039
And
when
they
were
come
up
out
of
the
water,
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
caught
away
Philip,
that
the
eunuch
saw
him
no
more:
and
he
went
on
his
way
rejoicing.
008:040
But
Philip
was
found
at
Azotus:
and
passing
through
he
preached
in
all
the
cities,
till
he
came
to
Caesarea.
009:001
And
Saul,
yet
breathing
out
threatenings
and
slaughter
against
the
disciples
of
the
Lord,
went
unto
the
high
priest,
009:002
And
desired
of
him
letters
to
Damascus
to
the
synagogues,
that
if
he
found
any
of
this
way,
whether
they
were
men
or
women,
he
might
bring
them
bound
unto
Jerusalem.
009:003
And
as
he
journeyed,
he
came
near
Damascus:
and
suddenly
there
shined
round
about
him
a
light
from
heaven:
009:004
And
he
fell
to
the
earth,
and
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
him,
Saul,
Saul,
why
persecutest
thou
me?
009:005
And
he
said,
Who
art
thou,
Lord?
And
the
Lord
said,
I
am
Jesus
whom
thou
persecutest:
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks.
009:006
And
he
trembling
and
astonished
said,
Lord,
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do?
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him,
Arise,
and
go
into
the
city,
and
it
shall
be
told
thee
what
thou
must
do.
009:007
And
the
men
which
journeyed
with
him
stood
speechless,
hearing
a
voice,
but
seeing
no
man.
009:008
And
Saul
arose
from
the
earth;
and
when
his
eyes
were
opened,
he
saw
no
man:
but
they
led
him
by
the
hand,
and
brought
him
into
Damascus.
009:009
And
he
was
three
days
without
sight,
and
neither
did
eat
nor
drink.
009:010
And
there
was
a
certain
disciple
at
Damascus,
named
Ananias;
and
to
him
said
the
Lord
in
a
vision,
Ananias.
And
he
said,
Behold,
I
am
here,
Lord.
009:011
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him,
Arise,
and
go
into
the
street
which
is
called
Straight,
and
enquire
in
the
house
of
Judas
for
one
called
Saul,
of
Tarsus:
for,
behold,
he
prayeth,
009:012
And
hath
seen
in
a
vision
a
man
named
Ananias
coming
in,
and
putting
his
hand
on
him,
that
he
might
receive
his
sight.
009:013
Then
Ananias
answered,
Lord,
I
have
heard
by
many
of
this
man,
how
much
evil
he
hath
done
to
thy
saints
at
Jerusalem:
009:014
And
here
he
hath
authority
from
the
chief
priests
to
bind
all
that
call
on
thy
name.
009:015
But
the
Lord
said
unto
him,
Go
thy
way:
for
he
is
a
chosen
vessel
unto
me,
to
bear
my
name
before
the
Gentiles,
and
kings,
and
the
children
of
Israel:
009:016
For
I
will
shew
him
how
great
things
he
must
suffer
for
my
name's
sake.
009:017
And
Ananias
went
his
way,
and
entered
into
the
house;
and
putting
his
hands
on
him
said,
Brother
Saul,
the
Lord,
even
Jesus,
that
appeared
unto
thee
in
the
way
as
thou
camest,
hath
sent
me,
that
thou
mightest
receive
thy
sight,
and
be
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost.
009:018
And
immediately
there
fell
from
his
eyes
as
it
had
been
scales:
and
he
received
sight
forthwith,
and
arose,
and
was
baptized.
009:019
And
when
he
had
received
meat,
he
was
strengthened.
Then
was
Saul
certain
days
with
the
disciples
which
were
at
Damascus.
009:020
And
straightway
he
preached
Christ
in
the
synagogues,
that
he
is
the
Son
of
God.
009:021
But
all
that
heard
him
were
amazed,
and
said;
Is
not
this
he
that
destroyed
them
which
called
on
this
name
in
Jerusalem,
and
came
hither
for
that
intent,
that
he
might
bring
them
bound
unto
the
chief
priests?
009:022
But
Saul
increased
the
more
in
strength,
and
confounded
the
Jews
which
dwelt
at
Damascus,
proving
that
this
is
very
Christ.
009:023
And
after
that
many
days
were
fulfilled,
the
Jews
took
counsel
to
kill
him:
009:024
But
their
laying
await
was
known
of
Saul.
And
they
watched
the
gates
day
and
night
to
kill
him.
009:025
Then
the
disciples
took
him
by
night,
and
let
him
down
by
the
wall
in
a
basket.
009:026
And
when
Saul
was
come
to
Jerusalem,
he
assayed
to
join
himself
to
the
disciples:
but
they
were
all
afraid
of
him,
and
believed
not
that
he
was
a
disciple.
009:027
But
Barnabas
took
him,
and
brought
him
to
the
apostles,
and
declared
unto
them
how
he
had
seen
the
Lord
in
the
way,
and
that
he
had
spoken
to
him,
and
how
he
had
preached
boldly
at
Damascus
in
the
name
of
Jesus.
009:028
And
he
was
with
them
coming
in
and
going
out
at
Jerusalem.
009:029
And
he
spake
boldly
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus,
and
disputed
against
the
Grecians:
but
they
went
about
to
slay
him.
009:030
Which
when
the
brethren
knew,
they
brought
him
down
to
Caesarea,
and
sent
him
forth
to
Tarsus.
009:031
Then
had
the
churches
rest
throughout
all
Judaea
and
Galilee
and
Samaria,
and
were
edified;
and
walking
in
the
fear
of
the
Lord,
and
in
the
comfort
of
the
Holy
Ghost,
were
multiplied.
009:032
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
Peter
passed
throughout
all
quarters,
he
came
down
also
to
the
saints
which
dwelt
at
Lydda.
009:033
And
there
he
found
a
certain
man
named
Aeneas,
which
had
kept
his
bed
eight
years,
and
was
sick
of
the
palsy.
009:034
And
Peter
said
unto
him,
Aeneas,
Jesus
Christ
maketh
thee
whole:
arise,
and
make
thy
bed.
And
he
arose
immediately.
009:035
And
all
that
dwelt
at
Lydda
and
Saron
saw
him,
and
turned
to
the
Lord.
009:036
Now
there
was
at
Joppa
a
certain
disciple
named
Tabitha,
which
by
interpretation
is
called
Dorcas:
this
woman
was
full
of
good
works
and
almsdeeds
which
she
did.
009:037
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days,
that
she
was
sick,
and
died:
whom
when
they
had
washed,
they
laid
her
in
an
upper
chamber.
009:038
And
forasmuch
as
Lydda
was
nigh
to
Joppa,
and
the
disciples
had
heard
that
Peter
was
there,
they
sent
unto
him
two
men,
desiring
him
that
he
would
not
delay
to
come
to
them.
009:039
Then
Peter
arose
and
went
with
them.
When
he
was
come,
they
brought
him
into
the
upper
chamber:
and
all
the
widows
stood
by
him
weeping,
and
shewing
the
coats
and
garments
which
Dorcas
made,
while
she
was
with
them.
009:040
But
Peter
put
them
all
forth,
and
kneeled
down,
and
prayed;
and
turning
him
to
the
body
said,
Tabitha,
arise.
And
she
opened
her
eyes:
and
when
she
saw
Peter,
she
sat
up.
009:041
And
he
gave
her
his
hand,
and
lifted
her
up,
and
when
he
had
called
the
saints
and
widows,
presented
her
alive.
009:042
And
it
was
known
throughout
all
Joppa;
and
many
believed
in
the
Lord.
009:043
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
he
tarried
many
days
in
Joppa
with
one
Simon
a
tanner.
010:001
There
was
a
certain
man
in
Caesarea
called
Cornelius,
a
centurion
of
the
band
called
the
Italian
band,
010:002
A
devout
man,
and
one
that
feared
God
with
all
his
house,
which
gave
much
alms
to
the
people,
and
prayed
to
God
alway.
010:003
He
saw
in
a
vision
evidently
about
the
ninth
hour
of
the
day
an
angel
of
God
coming
in
to
him,
and
saying
unto
him,
Cornelius.
010:004
And
when
he
looked
on
him,
he
was
afraid,
and
said,
What
is
it,
Lord?
And
he
said
unto
him,
Thy
prayers
and
thine
alms
are
come
up
for
a
memorial
before
God.
010:005
And
now
send
men
to
Joppa,
and
call
for
one
Simon,
whose
surname
is
Peter:
010:006
He
lodgeth
with
one
Simon
a
tanner,
whose
house
is
by
the
sea
side:
he
shall
tell
thee
what
thou
oughtest
to
do.
010:007
And
when
the
angel
which
spake
unto
Cornelius
was
departed,
he
called
two
of
his
household
servants,
and
a
devout
soldier
of
them
that
waited
on
him
continually;
010:008
And
when
he
had
declared
all
these
things
unto
them,
he
sent
them
to
Joppa.
010:009
On
the
morrow,
as
they
went
on
their
journey,
and
drew
nigh
unto
the
city,
Peter
went
up
upon
the
housetop
to
pray
about
the
sixth
hour:
010:010
And
he
became
very
hungry,
and
would
have
eaten:
but
while
they
made
ready,
he
fell
into
a
trance,
010:011
And
saw
heaven
opened,
and
a
certain
vessel
descending
upon
him,
as
it
had
been
a
great
sheet
knit
at
the
four
corners,
and
let
down
to
the
earth:
010:012
Wherein
were
all
manner
of
fourfooted
beasts
of
the
earth,
and
wild
beasts,
and
creeping
things,
and
fowls
of
the
air.
010:013
And
there
came
a
voice
to
him,
Rise,
Peter;
kill,
and
eat.
010:014
But
Peter
said,
Not
so,
Lord;
for
I
have
never
eaten
any
thing
that
is
common
or
unclean.
010:015
And
the
voice
spake
unto
him
again
the
second
time,
What
God
hath
cleansed,
that
call
not
thou
common.
010:016
This
was
done
thrice:
and
the
vessel
was
received
up
again
into
heaven.
010:017
Now
while
Peter
doubted
in
himself
what
this
vision
which
he
had
seen
should
mean,
behold,
the
men
which
were
sent
from
Cornelius
had
made
enquiry
for
Simon's
house,
and
stood
before
the
gate,
010:018
And
called,
and
asked
whether
Simon,
which
was
surnamed
Peter,
were
lodged
there.
010:019
While
Peter
thought
on
the
vision,
the
Spirit
said
unto
him,
Behold,
three
men
seek
thee.
010:020
Arise
therefore,
and
get
thee
down,
and
go
with
them,
doubting
nothing:
for
I
have
sent
them.
010:021
Then
Peter
went
down
to
the
men
which
were
sent
unto
him
from
Cornelius;
and
said,
Behold,
I
am
he
whom
ye
seek:
what
is
the
cause
wherefore
ye
are
come?
010:022
And
they
said,
Cornelius
the
centurion,
a
