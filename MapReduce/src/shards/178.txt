just
man,
and
one
that
feareth
God,
and
of
good
report
among
all
the
nation
of
the
Jews,
was
warned
from
God
by
an
holy
angel
to
send
for
thee
into
his
house,
and
to
hear
words
of
thee.
010:023
Then
called
he
them
in,
and
lodged
them.
And
on
the
morrow
Peter
went
away
with
them,
and
certain
brethren
from
Joppa
accompanied
him.
010:024
And
the
morrow
after
they
entered
into
Caesarea.
And
Cornelius
waited
for
them,
and
he
had
called
together
his
kinsmen
and
near
friends.
010:025
And
as
Peter
was
coming
in,
Cornelius
met
him,
and
fell
down
at
his
feet,
and
worshipped
him.
010:026
But
Peter
took
him
up,
saying,
Stand
up;
I
myself
also
am
a
man.
010:027
And
as
he
talked
with
him,
he
went
in,
and
found
many
that
were
come
together.
010:028
And
he
said
unto
them,
Ye
know
how
that
it
is
an
unlawful
thing
for
a
man
that
is
a
Jew
to
keep
company,
or
come
unto
one
of
another
nation;
but
God
hath
shewed
me
that
I
should
not
call
any
man
common
or
unclean.
010:029
Therefore
came
I
unto
you
without
gainsaying,
as
soon
as
I
was
sent
for:
I
ask
therefore
for
what
intent
ye
have
sent
for
me?
010:030
And
Cornelius
said,
Four
days
ago
I
was
fasting
until
this
hour;
and
at
the
ninth
hour
I
prayed
in
my
house,
and,
behold,
a
man
stood
before
me
in
bright
clothing,
010:031
And
said,
Cornelius,
thy
prayer
is
heard,
and
thine
alms
are
had
in
remembrance
in
the
sight
of
God.
010:032
Send
therefore
to
Joppa,
and
call
hither
Simon,
whose
surname
is
Peter;
he
is
lodged
in
the
house
of
one
Simon
a
tanner
by
the
sea
side:
who,
when
he
cometh,
shall
speak
unto
thee.
010:033
Immediately
therefore
I
sent
to
thee;
and
thou
hast
well
done
that
thou
art
come.
Now
therefore
are
we
all
here
present
before
God,
to
hear
all
things
that
are
commanded
thee
of
God.
010:034
Then
Peter
opened
his
mouth,
and
said,
Of
a
truth
I
perceive
that
God
is
no
respecter
of
persons:
010:035
But
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
him,
and
worketh
righteousness,
is
accepted
with
him.
010:036
The
word
which
God
sent
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
preaching
peace
by
Jesus
Christ:
(he
is
Lord
of
all:)
010:037
That
word,
I
say,
ye
know,
which
was
published
throughout
all
Judaea,
and
began
from
Galilee,
after
the
baptism
which
John
preached;
010:038
How
God
anointed
Jesus
of
Nazareth
with
the
Holy
Ghost
and
with
power:
who
went
about
doing
good,
and
healing
all
that
were
oppressed
of
the
devil;
for
God
was
with
him.
010:039
And
we
are
witnesses
of
all
things
which
he
did
both
in
the
land
of
the
Jews,
and
in
Jerusalem;
whom
they
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree:
010:040
Him
God
raised
up
the
third
day,
and
shewed
him
openly;
010:041
Not
to
all
the
people,
but
unto
witnesses
chosen
before
God,
even
to
us,
who
did
eat
and
drink
with
him
after
he
rose
from
the
dead.
010:042
And
he
commanded
us
to
preach
unto
the
people,
and
to
testify
that
it
is
he
which
was
ordained
of
God
to
be
the
Judge
of
quick
and
dead.
010:043
To
him
give
all
the
prophets
witness,
that
through
his
name
whosoever
believeth
in
him
shall
receive
remission
of
sins.
010:044
While
Peter
yet
spake
these
words,
the
Holy
Ghost
fell
on
all
them
which
heard
the
word.
010:045
And
they
of
the
circumcision
which
believed
were
astonished,
as
many
as
came
with
Peter,
because
that
on
the
Gentiles
also
was
poured
out
the
gift
of
the
Holy
Ghost.
010:046
For
they
heard
them
speak
with
tongues,
and
magnify
God.
Then
answered
Peter,
010:047
Can
any
man
forbid
water,
that
these
should
not
be
baptized,
which
have
received
the
Holy
Ghost
as
well
as
we?
010:048
And
he
commanded
them
to
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Lord.
Then
prayed
they
him
to
tarry
certain
days.
011:001
And
the
apostles
and
brethren
that
were
in
Judaea
heard
that
the
Gentiles
had
also
received
the
word
of
God.
011:002
And
when
Peter
was
come
up
to
Jerusalem,
they
that
were
of
the
circumcision
contended
with
him,
011:003
Saying,
Thou
wentest
in
to
men
uncircumcised,
and
didst
eat
with
them.
011:004
But
Peter
rehearsed
the
matter
from
the
beginning,
and
expounded
it
by
order
unto
them,
saying,
011:005
I
was
in
the
city
of
Joppa
praying:
and
in
a
trance
I
saw
a
vision,
A
certain
vessel
descend,
as
it
had
been
a
great
sheet,
let
down
from
heaven
by
four
corners;
and
it
came
even
to
me:
011:006
Upon
the
which
when
I
had
fastened
mine
eyes,
I
considered,
and
saw
fourfooted
beasts
of
the
earth,
and
wild
beasts,
and
creeping
things,
and
fowls
of
the
air.
011:007
And
I
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
me,
Arise,
Peter;
slay
and
eat.
011:008
But
I
said,
Not
so,
Lord:
for
nothing
common
or
unclean
hath
at
any
time
entered
into
my
mouth.
011:009
But
the
voice
answered
me
again
from
heaven,
What
God
hath
cleansed,
that
call
not
thou
common.
011:010
And
this
was
done
three
times:
and
all
were
drawn
up
again
into
heaven.
011:011
And,
behold,
immediately
there
were
three
men
already
come
unto
the
house
where
I
was,
sent
from
Caesarea
unto
me.
011:012
And
the
Spirit
bade
me
go
with
them,
nothing
doubting.
Moreover
these
six
brethren
accompanied
me,
and
we
entered
into
the
man's
house:
011:013
And
he
shewed
us
how
he
had
seen
an
angel
in
his
house,
which
stood
and
said
unto
him,
Send
men
to
Joppa,
and
call
for
Simon,
whose
surname
is
Peter;
011:014
Who
shall
tell
thee
words,
whereby
thou
and
all
thy
house
shall
be
saved.
011:015
And
as
I
began
to
speak,
the
Holy
Ghost
fell
on
them,
as
on
us
at
the
beginning.
011:016
Then
remembered
I
the
word
of
the
Lord,
how
that
he
said,
John
indeed
baptized
with
water;
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
Holy
Ghost.
011:017
Forasmuch
then
as
God
gave
them
the
like
gift
as
he
did
unto
us,
who
believed
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ;
what
was
I,
that
I
could
withstand
God?
011:018
When
they
heard
these
things,
they
held
their
peace,
and
glorified
God,
saying,
Then
hath
God
also
to
the
Gentiles
granted
repentance
unto
life.
011:019
Now
they
which
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
persecution
that
arose
about
Stephen
travelled
as
far
as
Phenice,
and
Cyprus,
and
Antioch,
preaching
the
word
to
none
but
unto
the
Jews
only.
011:020
And
some
of
them
were
men
of
Cyprus
and
Cyrene,
which,
when
they
were
come
to
Antioch,
spake
unto
the
Grecians,
preaching
the
LORD
Jesus.
011:021
And
the
hand
of
the
Lord
was
with
them:
and
a
great
number
believed,
and
turned
unto
the
Lord.
011:022
Then
tidings
of
these
things
came
unto
the
ears
of
the
church
which
was
in
Jerusalem:
and
they
sent
forth
Barnabas,
that
he
should
go
as
far
as
Antioch.
011:023
Who,
when
he
came,
and
had
seen
the
grace
of
God,
was
glad,
and
exhorted
them
all,
that
with
purpose
of
heart
they
would
cleave
unto
the
Lord.
011:024
For
he
was
a
good
man,
and
full
of
the
Holy
Ghost
and
of
faith:
and
much
people
was
added
unto
the
Lord.
011:025
Then
departed
Barnabas
to
Tarsus,
for
to
seek
Saul:
011:026
And
when
he
had
found
him,
he
brought
him
unto
Antioch.
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
a
whole
year
they
assembled
themselves
with
the
church,
and
taught
much
people.
And
the
disciples
were
called
Christians
first
in
Antioch.
011:027
And
in
these
days
came
prophets
from
Jerusalem
unto
Antioch.
011:028
And
there
stood
up
one
of
them
named
Agabus,
and
signified
by
the
Spirit
that
there
should
be
great
dearth
throughout
all
the
world:
which
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Claudius
Caesar.
011:029
Then
the
disciples,
every
man
according
to
his
ability,
determined
to
send
relief
unto
the
brethren
which
dwelt
in
Judaea:
011:030
Which
also
they
did,
and
sent
it
to
the
elders
by
the
hands
of
Barnabas
and
Saul.
012:001
Now
about
that
time
Herod
the
king
stretched
forth
his
hands
to
vex
certain
of
the
church.
012:002
And
he
killed
James
the
brother
of
John
with
the
sword.
012:003
And
because
he
saw
it
pleased
the
Jews,
he
proceeded
further
to
take
Peter
also.
(Then
were
the
days
of
unleavened
bread.)
012:004
And
when
he
had
apprehended
him,
he
put
him
in
prison,
and
delivered
him
to
four
quaternions
of
soldiers
to
keep
him;
intending
after
Easter
to
bring
him
forth
to
the
people.
012:005
Peter
therefore
was
kept
in
prison:
but
prayer
was
made
without
ceasing
of
the
church
unto
God
for
him.
012:006
And
when
Herod
would
have
brought
him
forth,
the
same
night
Peter
was
sleeping
between
two
soldiers,
bound
with
two
chains:
and
the
keepers
before
the
door
kept
the
prison.
012:007
And,
behold,
the
angel
of
the
Lord
came
upon
him,
and
a
light
shined
in
the
prison:
and
he
smote
Peter
on
the
side,
and
raised
him
up,
saying,
Arise
up
quickly.
And
his
chains
fell
off
from
his
hands.
012:008
And
the
angel
said
unto
him,
Gird
thyself,
and
bind
on
thy
sandals.
And
so
he
did.
And
he
saith
unto
him,
Cast
thy
garment
about
thee,
and
follow
me.
012:009
And
he
went
out,
and
followed
him;
and
wist
not
that
it
was
true
which
was
done
by
the
angel;
but
thought
he
saw
a
vision.
012:010
When
they
were
past
the
first
and
the
second
ward,
they
came
unto
the
iron
gate
that
leadeth
unto
the
city;
which
opened
to
them
of
his
own
accord:
and
they
went
out,
and
passed
on
through
one
street;
and
forthwith
the
angel
departed
from
him.
012:011
And
when
Peter
was
come
to
himself,
he
said,
Now
I
know
of
a
surety,
that
the
LORD
hath
sent
his
angel,
and
hath
delivered
me
out
of
the
hand
of
Herod,
and
from
all
the
expectation
of
the
people
of
the
Jews.
012:012
And
when
he
had
considered
the
thing,
he
came
to
the
house
of
Mary
the
mother
of
John,
whose
surname
was
Mark;
where
many
were
gathered
together
praying.
012:013
And
as
Peter
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
gate,
a
damsel
came
to
hearken,
named
Rhoda.
012:014
And
when
she
knew
Peter's
voice,
she
opened
not
the
gate
for
gladness,
but
ran
in,
and
told
how
Peter
stood
before
the
gate.
012:015
And
they
said
unto
her,
Thou
art
mad.
But
she
constantly
affirmed
that
it
was
even
so.
Then
said
they,
It
is
his
angel.
012:016
But
Peter
continued
knocking:
and
when
they
had
opened
the
door,
and
saw
him,
they
were
astonished.
012:017
But
he,
beckoning
unto
them
with
the
hand
to
hold
their
peace,
declared
unto
them
how
the
Lord
had
brought
him
out
of
the
prison.
And
he
said,
Go
shew
these
things
unto
James,
and
to
the
brethren.
And
he
departed,
and
went
into
another
place.
012:018
Now
as
soon
as
it
was
day,
there
was
no
small
stir
among
the
soldiers,
what
was
become
of
Peter.
012:019
And
when
Herod
had
sought
for
him,
and
found
him
not,
he
examined
the
keepers,
and
commanded
that
they
should
be
put
to
death.
And
he
went
down
from
Judaea
to
Caesarea,
and
there
abode.
012:020
And
Herod
was
highly
displeased
with
them
of
Tyre
and
Sidon:
but
they
came
with
one
accord
to
him,
and,
having
made
Blastus
the
king's
chamberlain
their
friend,
desired
peace;
because
their
country
was
nourished
by
the
king's
country.
012:021
And
upon
a
set
day
Herod,
arrayed
in
royal
apparel,
sat
upon
his
throne,
and
made
an
oration
unto
them.
012:022
And
the
people
gave
a
shout,
saying,
It
is
the
voice
of
a
god,
and
not
of
a
man.
012:023
And
immediately
the
angel
of
the
Lord
smote
him,
because
he
gave
not
God
the
glory:
and
he
was
eaten
of
worms,
and
gave
up
the
ghost.
012:024
But
the
word
of
God
grew
and
multiplied.
012:025
And
Barnabas
and
Saul
returned
from
Jerusalem,
when
they
had
fulfilled
their
ministry,
and
took
with
them
John,
whose
surname
was
Mark.
013:001
Now
there
were
in
the
church
that
was
at
Antioch
certain
prophets
and
teachers;
as
Barnabas,
and
Simeon
that
was
called
Niger,
and
Lucius
of
Cyrene,
and
Manaen,
which
had
been
brought
up
with
Herod
the
tetrarch,
and
Saul.
013:002
As
they
ministered
to
the
Lord,
and
fasted,
the
Holy
Ghost
said,
Separate
me
Barnabas
and
Saul
for
the
work
whereunto
I
have
called
them.
013:003
And
when
they
had
fasted
and
prayed,
and
laid
their
hands
on
them,
they
sent
them
away.
013:004
So
they,
being
sent
forth
by
the
Holy
Ghost,
departed
unto
Seleucia;
and
from
thence
they
sailed
to
Cyprus.
013:005
And
when
they
were
at
Salamis,
they
preached
the
word
of
God
in
the
synagogues
of
the
Jews:
and
they
had
also
John
to
their
minister.
013:006
And
when
they
had
gone
through
the
isle
unto
Paphos,
they
found
a
certain
sorcerer,
a
false
prophet,
a
Jew,
whose
name
was
Barjesus:
013:007
Which
was
with
the
deputy
of
the
country,
Sergius
Paulus,
a
prudent
man;
who
called
for
Barnabas
and
Saul,
and
desired
to
hear
the
word
of
God.
013:008
But
Elymas
the
sorcerer
(for
so
is
his
name
by
interpretation)
withstood
them,
seeking
to
turn
away
the
deputy
from
the
faith.
013:009
Then
Saul,
(who
also
is
called
Paul,)
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost,
set
his
eyes
on
him.
013:010
And
said,
O
full
of
all
subtilty
and
all
mischief,
thou
child
of
the
devil,
thou
enemy
of
all
righteousness,
wilt
thou
not
cease
to
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
Lord?
013:011
And
now,
behold,
the
hand
of
the
Lord
is
upon
thee,
and
thou
shalt
be
blind,
not
seeing
the
sun
for
a
season.
And
immediately
there
fell
on
him
a
mist
and
a
darkness;
and
he
went
about
seeking
some
to
lead
him
by
the
hand.
013:012
Then
the
deputy,
when
he
saw
what
was
done,
believed,
being
astonished
at
the
doctrine
of
the
Lord.
013:013
Now
when
Paul
and
his
company
loosed
from
Paphos,
they
came
to
Perga
in
Pamphylia:
and
John
departing
from
them
returned
to
Jerusalem.
013:014
But
when
they
departed
from
Perga,
they
came
to
Antioch
in
Pisidia,
and
went
into
the
synagogue
on
the
sabbath
day,
and
sat
down.
013:015
And
after
the
reading
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
the
rulers
of
the
synagogue
sent
unto
them,
saying,
Ye
men
and
brethren,
if
ye
have
any
word
of
exhortation
for
the
people,
say
on.
013:016
Then
Paul
stood
up,
and
beckoning
with
his
hand
said,
Men
of
Israel,
and
ye
that
fear
God,
give
audience.
013:017
The
God
of
this
people
of
Israel
chose
our
fathers,
and
exalted
the
people
when
they
dwelt
as
strangers
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
with
an
high
arm
brought
he
them
out
of
it.
013:018
And
about
the
time
of
forty
years
suffered
he
their
manners
in
the
wilderness.
013:019
And
when
he
had
destroyed
seven
nations
in
the
land
of
Chanaan,
he
divided
their
land
to
them
by
lot.
013:020
And
after
that
he
gave
unto
them
judges
about
the
space
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
years,
until
Samuel
the
prophet.
013:021
And
afterward
they
desired
a
king:
and
God
gave
unto
them
Saul
the
son
of
Cis,
a
man
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin,
by
the
space
of
forty
years.
013:022
And
when
he
had
removed
him,
he
raised
up
unto
them
David
to
be
their
king;
to
whom
also
he
gave
their
testimony,
and
said,
I
have
found
David
the
son
of
Jesse,
a
man
after
mine
own
heart,
which
shall
fulfil
all
my
will.
013:023
Of
this
man's
seed
hath
God
according
to
his
promise
raised
unto
Israel
a
Saviour,
Jesus:
013:024
When
John
had
first
preached
before
his
coming
the
baptism
of
repentance
to
all
the
people
of
Israel.
013:025
And
as
John
fulfilled
his
course,
he
said,
Whom
think
ye
that
I
am?
I
am
not
he.
But,
behold,
there
cometh
one
after
me,
whose
shoes
of
his
feet
I
am
not
worthy
to
loose.
013:026
Men
and
brethren,
children
of
the
stock
of
Abraham,
and
whosoever
among
you
feareth
God,
to
you
is
the
word
of
this
salvation
sent.
013:027
For
they
that
dwell
at
Jerusalem,
and
their
rulers,
because
they
knew
him
not,
nor
yet
the
voices
of
the
prophets
which
are
read
every
sabbath
day,
they
have
fulfilled
them
in
condemning
him.
013:028
And
though
they
found
no
cause
of
death
in
him,
yet
desired
they
Pilate
that
he
should
be
slain.
013:029
And
when
they
had
fulfilled
all
that
was
written
of
him,
they
took
him
down
from
the
tree,
and
laid
him
in
a
sepulchre.
013:030
But
God
raised
him
from
the
dead:
013:031
And
he
was
seen
many
days
of
them
which
came
up
with
him
from
Galilee
to
Jerusalem,
who
are
his
witnesses
unto
the
people.
013:032
And
we
declare
unto
you
glad
tidings,
how
that
the
promise
which
was
made
unto
the
fathers,
013:033
God
hath
fulfilled
the
same
unto
us
their
children,
in
that
he
hath
raised
up
Jesus
again;
as
it
is
also
written
in
the
second
psalm,
Thou
art
my
Son,
this
day
have
I
begotten
thee.
013:034
And
as
concerning
that
he
raised
him
up
from
the
dead,
now
no
more
to
return
to
corruption,
he
said
on
this
wise,
I
will
give
you
the
sure
mercies
of
David.
013:035
Wherefore
he
saith
also
in
another
psalm,
Thou
shalt
not
suffer
thine
Holy
One
to
see
corruption.
013:036
For
David,
after
he
had
served
his
own
generation
by
the
will
of
God,
fell
on
sleep,
and
was
laid
unto
his
fathers,
and
saw
corruption:
013:037
But
he,
whom
God
raised
again,
saw
no
corruption.
013:038
Be
it
known
unto
you
therefore,
men
and
brethren,
that
through
this
man
is
preached
unto
you
the
forgiveness
of
sins:
013:039
And
by
him
all
that
believe
are
justified
from
all
things,
from
which
ye
could
not
be
justified
by
the
law
of
Moses.
013:040
Beware
therefore,
lest
that
come
upon
you,
which
is
spoken
of
in
the
prophets;
013:041
Behold,
ye
despisers,
and
wonder,
and
perish:
for
I
work
a
work
in
your
days,
a
work
which
ye
shall
in
no
wise
believe,
though
a
man
declare
it
unto
you.
013:042
And
when
the
Jews
were
gone
out
of
the
synagogue,
the
Gentiles
besought
that
these
words
might
be
preached
to
them
the
next
sabbath.
013:043
Now
when
the
congregation
was
broken
up,
many
of
the
Jews
and
religious
proselytes
followed
Paul
and
Barnabas:
who,
speaking
to
them,
persuaded
them
to
continue
in
the
grace
of
God.
013:044
And
the
next
sabbath
day
came
almost
the
whole
city
together
to
hear
the
word
of
God.
013:045
But
when
the
Jews
saw
the
multitudes,
they
were
filled
with
envy,
and
spake
against
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
Paul,
contradicting
and
blaspheming.
013:046
Then
Paul
and
Barnabas
waxed
bold,
and
said,
It
was
necessary
that
the
word
of
God
should
first
have
been
spoken
to
you:
but
seeing
ye
put
it
from
you,
and
judge
yourselves
unworthy
of
everlasting
life,
lo,
we
turn
to
the
Gentiles.
013:047
For
so
hath
the
Lord
commanded
us,
saying,
I
have
set
thee
to
be
a
light
of
the
Gentiles,
that
thou
shouldest
be
for
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth.
013:048
And
when
the
Gentiles
heard
this,
they
were
glad,
and
glorified
the
word
of
the
Lord:
and
as
many
as
were
ordained
to
eternal
life
believed.
013:049
And
the
word
of
the
Lord
was
published
throughout
all
the
region.
013:050
But
the
Jews
stirred
up
the
devout
and
honourable
women,
and
the
chief
men
of
the
city,
and
raised
persecution
against
Paul
and
Barnabas,
and
expelled
them
out
of
their
coasts.
013:051
But
they
shook
off
the
dust
of
their
feet
against
them,
and
came
unto
Iconium.
013:052
And
the
disciples
were
filled
with
joy,
and
with
the
Holy
Ghost.
014:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
Iconium,
that
they
went
both
together
into
the
synagogue
of
the
Jews,
and
so
spake,
that
a
great
multitude
both
of
the
Jews
and
also
of
the
Greeks
believed.
014:002
But
the
unbelieving
Jews
stirred
up
the
Gentiles,
and
made
their
minds
evil
affected
against
the
brethren.
014:003
Long
time
therefore
abode
they
speaking
boldly
in
the
Lord,
which
gave
testimony
unto
the
word
of
his
grace,
and
granted
signs
and
wonders
to
be
done
by
their
hands.
014:004
But
the
multitude
of
the
city
was
divided:
and
part
held
with
the
Jews,
and
part
with
the
apostles.
014:005
And
when
there
was
an
assault
made
both
of
the
Gentiles,
and
also
of
the
Jews
with
their
rulers,
to
use
them
despitefully,
and
to
stone
them,
014:006
They
were
ware
of
it,
and
fled
unto
Lystra
and
Derbe,
cities
of
Lycaonia,
and
unto
the
region
that
lieth
round
about:
014:007
And
there
they
preached
the
gospel.
014:008
And
there
sat
a
certain
man
at
Lystra,
impotent
in
his
feet,
being
a
cripple
from
his
mother's
womb,
who
never
had
walked:
014:009
The
same
heard
Paul
speak:
who
stedfastly
beholding
him,
and
perceiving
that
he
had
faith
to
be
healed,
014:010
Said
with
a
loud
voice,
Stand
upright
on
thy
feet.
And
he
leaped
and
walked.
014:011
And
when
the
people
saw
what
Paul
had
done,
they
lifted
up
their
voices,
saying
in
the
speech
of
Lycaonia,
The
gods
are
come
down
to
us
in
the
likeness
of
men.
014:012
And
they
called
Barnabas,
Jupiter;
and
Paul,
Mercurius,
because
he
was
the
chief
speaker.
014:013
Then
the
priest
of
Jupiter,
which
was
before
their
city,
brought
oxen
and
garlands
unto
the
gates,
and
would
have
done
sacrifice
with
the
people.
014:014
Which
when
the
apostles,
Barnabas
and
Paul,
heard
of,
they
rent
their
clothes,
and
ran
in
among
the
people,
crying
out,
014:015
And
saying,
Sirs,
why
do
ye
these
things?
We
also
are
men
of
like
passions
with
you,
and
preach
unto
you
that
ye
should
turn
from
these
vanities
unto
the
living
God,
which
made
heaven,
and
earth,
and
the
sea,
and
all
things
that
are
therein:
014:016
Who
in
times
past
suffered
all
nations
to
walk
in
their
own
ways.
014:017
Nevertheless
he
left
not
himself
without
witness,
in
that
he
did
good,
and
gave
us
rain
from
heaven,
and
fruitful
seasons,
filling
our
hearts
with
food
and
gladness.
014:018
And
with
these
sayings
scarce
restrained
they
the
people,
that
they
had
not
done
sacrifice
unto
them.
014:019
And
there
came
thither
certain
Jews
from
Antioch
and
Iconium,
who
persuaded
the
people,
and
having
stoned
Paul,
drew
him
out
of
the
city,
supposing
he
had
been
dead.
014:020
Howbeit,
as
the
disciples
stood
round
about
him,
he
rose
up,
and
came
into
the
city:
and
the
next
day
he
departed
with
Barnabas
to
Derbe.
014:021
And
when
they
had
preached
the
gospel
to
that
city,
and
had
taught
many,
they
returned
again
to
Lystra,
and
to
Iconium,
and
Antioch,
014:022
Confirming
the
souls
of
the
disciples,
and
exhorting
them
to
continue
in
the
faith,
and
that
we
must
through
much
tribulation
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God.
014:023
And
when
they
had
ordained
them
elders
in
every
church,
and
had
prayed
with
fasting,
they
commended
them
to
the
Lord,
on
whom
they
believed.
014:024
And
after
they
had
passed
throughout
Pisidia,
they
came
to
Pamphylia.
014:025
And
when
they
had
preached
the
word
in
Perga,
they
went
down
into
Attalia:
014:026
And
thence
sailed
to
Antioch,
from
whence
they
had
been
recommended
to
the
grace
of
God
for
the
work
which
they
fulfilled.
014:027
And
when
they
were
come,
and
had
gathered
the
church
together,
they
rehearsed
all
that
God
had
done
with
them,
and
how
he
had
opened
the
door
of
faith
unto
the
Gentiles.
014:028
And
there
they
abode
long
time
with
the
disciples.
015:001
And
certain
men
which
came
down
from
Judaea
taught
the
brethren,
and
said,
Except
ye
be
circumcised
after
the
manner
of
Moses,
ye
cannot
be
saved.
015:002
When
therefore
Paul
and
Barnabas
had
no
small
dissension
and
disputation
with
them,
they
determined
that
Paul
and
Barnabas,
and
certain
other
of
them,
should
go
up
to
