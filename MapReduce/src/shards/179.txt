Jerusalem
unto
the
apostles
and
elders
about
this
question.
015:003
And
being
brought
on
their
way
by
the
church,
they
passed
through
Phenice
and
Samaria,
declaring
the
conversion
of
the
Gentiles:
and
they
caused
great
joy
unto
all
the
brethren.
015:004
And
when
they
were
come
to
Jerusalem,
they
were
received
of
the
church,
and
of
the
apostles
and
elders,
and
they
declared
all
things
that
God
had
done
with
them.
015:005
But
there
rose
up
certain
of
the
sect
of
the
Pharisees
which
believed,
saying,
That
it
was
needful
to
circumcise
them,
and
to
command
them
to
keep
the
law
of
Moses.
015:006
And
the
apostles
and
elders
came
together
for
to
consider
of
this
matter.
015:007
And
when
there
had
been
much
disputing,
Peter
rose
up,
and
said
unto
them,
Men
and
brethren,
ye
know
how
that
a
good
while
ago
God
made
choice
among
us,
that
the
Gentiles
by
my
mouth
should
hear
the
word
of
the
gospel,
and
believe.
015:008
And
God,
which
knoweth
the
hearts,
bare
them
witness,
giving
them
the
Holy
Ghost,
even
as
he
did
unto
us;
015:009
And
put
no
difference
between
us
and
them,
purifying
their
hearts
by
faith.
015:010
Now
therefore
why
tempt
ye
God,
to
put
a
yoke
upon
the
neck
of
the
disciples,
which
neither
our
fathers
nor
we
were
able
to
bear?
015:011
But
we
believe
that
through
the
grace
of
the
LORD
Jesus
Christ
we
shall
be
saved,
even
as
they.
015:012
Then
all
the
multitude
kept
silence,
and
gave
audience
to
Barnabas
and
Paul,
declaring
what
miracles
and
wonders
God
had
wrought
among
the
Gentiles
by
them.
015:013
And
after
they
had
held
their
peace,
James
answered,
saying,
Men
and
brethren,
hearken
unto
me:
015:014
Simeon
hath
declared
how
God
at
the
first
did
visit
the
Gentiles,
to
take
out
of
them
a
people
for
his
name.
015:015
And
to
this
agree
the
words
of
the
prophets;
as
it
is
written,
015:016
After
this
I
will
return,
and
will
build
again
the
tabernacle
of
David,
which
is
fallen
down;
and
I
will
build
again
the
ruins
thereof,
and
I
will
set
it
up:
015:017
That
the
residue
of
men
might
seek
after
the
Lord,
and
all
the
Gentiles,
upon
whom
my
name
is
called,
saith
the
Lord,
who
doeth
all
these
things.
015:018
Known
unto
God
are
all
his
works
from
the
beginning
of
the
world.
015:019
Wherefore
my
sentence
is,
that
we
trouble
not
them,
which
from
among
the
Gentiles
are
turned
to
God:
015:020
But
that
we
write
unto
them,
that
they
abstain
from
pollutions
of
idols,
and
from
fornication,
and
from
things
strangled,
and
from
blood.
015:021
For
Moses
of
old
time
hath
in
every
city
them
that
preach
him,
being
read
in
the
synagogues
every
sabbath
day.
015:022
Then
pleased
it
the
apostles
and
elders
with
the
whole
church,
to
send
chosen
men
of
their
own
company
to
Antioch
with
Paul
and
Barnabas;
namely,
Judas
surnamed
Barsabas
and
Silas,
chief
men
among
the
brethren:
015:023
And
they
wrote
letters
by
them
after
this
manner;
The
apostles
and
elders
and
brethren
send
greeting
unto
the
brethren
which
are
of
the
Gentiles
in
Antioch
and
Syria
and
Cilicia.
015:024
Forasmuch
as
we
have
heard,
that
certain
which
went
out
from
us
have
troubled
you
with
words,
subverting
your
souls,
saying,
Ye
must
be
circumcised,
and
keep
the
law:
to
whom
we
gave
no
such
commandment:
015:025
It
seemed
good
unto
us,
being
assembled
with
one
accord,
to
send
chosen
men
unto
you
with
our
beloved
Barnabas
and
Paul,
015:026
Men
that
have
hazarded
their
lives
for
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
015:027
We
have
sent
therefore
Judas
and
Silas,
who
shall
also
tell
you
the
same
things
by
mouth.
015:028
For
it
seemed
good
to
the
Holy
Ghost,
and
to
us,
to
lay
upon
you
no
greater
burden
than
these
necessary
things;
015:029
That
ye
abstain
from
meats
offered
to
idols,
and
from
blood,
and
from
things
strangled,
and
from
fornication:
from
which
if
ye
keep
yourselves,
ye
shall
do
well.
Fare
ye
well.
015:030
So
when
they
were
dismissed,
they
came
to
Antioch:
and
when
they
had
gathered
the
multitude
together,
they
delivered
the
epistle:
015:031
Which
when
they
had
read,
they
rejoiced
for
the
consolation.
015:032
And
Judas
and
Silas,
being
prophets
also
themselves,
exhorted
the
brethren
with
many
words,
and
confirmed
them.
015:033
And
after
they
had
tarried
there
a
space,
they
were
let
go
in
peace
from
the
brethren
unto
the
apostles.
015:034
Notwithstanding
it
pleased
Silas
to
abide
there
still.
015:035
Paul
also
and
Barnabas
continued
in
Antioch,
teaching
and
preaching
the
word
of
the
Lord,
with
many
others
also.
015:036
And
some
days
after
Paul
said
unto
Barnabas,
Let
us
go
again
and
visit
our
brethren
in
every
city
where
we
have
preached
the
word
of
the
LORD,
and
see
how
they
do.
015:037
And
Barnabas
determined
to
take
with
them
John,
whose
surname
was
Mark.
015:038
But
Paul
thought
not
good
to
take
him
with
them,
who
departed
from
them
from
Pamphylia,
and
went
not
with
them
to
the
work.
015:039
And
the
contention
was
so
sharp
between
them,
that
they
departed
asunder
one
from
the
other:
and
so
Barnabas
took
Mark,
and
sailed
unto
Cyprus;
015:040
And
Paul
chose
Silas,
and
departed,
being
recommended
by
the
brethren
unto
the
grace
of
God.
015:041
And
he
went
through
Syria
and
Cilicia,
confirming
the
churches.
016:001
Then
came
he
to
Derbe
and
Lystra:
and,
behold,
a
certain
disciple
was
there,
named
Timotheus,
the
son
of
a
certain
woman,
which
was
a
Jewess,
and
believed;
but
his
father
was
a
Greek:
016:002
Which
was
well
reported
of
by
the
brethren
that
were
at
Lystra
and
Iconium.
016:003
Him
would
Paul
have
to
go
forth
with
him;
and
took
and
circumcised
him
because
of
the
Jews
which
were
in
those
quarters:
for
they
knew
all
that
his
father
was
a
Greek.
016:004
And
as
they
went
through
the
cities,
they
delivered
them
the
decrees
for
to
keep,
that
were
ordained
of
the
apostles
and
elders
which
were
at
Jerusalem.
016:005
And
so
were
the
churches
established
in
the
faith,
and
increased
in
number
daily.
016:006
Now
when
they
had
gone
throughout
Phrygia
and
the
region
of
Galatia,
and
were
forbidden
of
the
Holy
Ghost
to
preach
the
word
in
Asia,
016:007
After
they
were
come
to
Mysia,
they
assayed
to
go
into
Bithynia:
but
the
Spirit
suffered
them
not.
016:008
And
they
passing
by
Mysia
came
down
to
Troas.
016:009
And
a
vision
appeared
to
Paul
in
the
night;
There
stood
a
man
of
Macedonia,
and
prayed
him,
saying,
Come
over
into
Macedonia,
and
help
us.
016:010
And
after
he
had
seen
the
vision,
immediately
we
endeavoured
to
go
into
Macedonia,
assuredly
gathering
that
the
Lord
had
called
us
for
to
preach
the
gospel
unto
them.
016:011
Therefore
loosing
from
Troas,
we
came
with
a
straight
course
to
Samothracia,
and
the
next
day
to
Neapolis;
016:012
And
from
thence
to
Philippi,
which
is
the
chief
city
of
that
part
of
Macedonia,
and
a
colony:
and
we
were
in
that
city
abiding
certain
days.
016:013
And
on
the
sabbath
we
went
out
of
the
city
by
a
river
side,
where
prayer
was
wont
to
be
made;
and
we
sat
down,
and
spake
unto
the
women
which
resorted
thither.
016:014
And
a
certain
woman
named
Lydia,
a
seller
of
purple,
of
the
city
of
Thyatira,
which
worshipped
God,
heard
us:
whose
heart
the
Lord
opened,
that
she
attended
unto
the
things
which
were
spoken
of
Paul.
016:015
And
when
she
was
baptized,
and
her
household,
she
besought
us,
saying,
If
ye
have
judged
me
to
be
faithful
to
the
Lord,
come
into
my
house,
and
abide
there.
And
she
constrained
us.
016:016
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
we
went
to
prayer,
a
certain
damsel
possessed
with
a
spirit
of
divination
met
us,
which
brought
her
masters
much
gain
by
soothsaying:
016:017
The
same
followed
Paul
and
us,
and
cried,
saying,
These
men
are
the
servants
of
the
most
high
God,
which
shew
unto
us
the
way
of
salvation.
016:018
And
this
did
she
many
days.
But
Paul,
being
grieved,
turned
and
said
to
the
spirit,
I
command
thee
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
to
come
out
of
her.
And
he
came
out
the
same
hour.
016:019
And
when
her
masters
saw
that
the
hope
of
their
gains
was
gone,
they
caught
Paul
and
Silas,
and
drew
them
into
the
marketplace
unto
the
rulers,
016:020
And
brought
them
to
the
magistrates,
saying,
These
men,
being
Jews,
do
exceedingly
trouble
our
city,
016:021
And
teach
customs,
which
are
not
lawful
for
us
to
receive,
neither
to
observe,
being
Romans.
016:022
And
the
multitude
rose
up
together
against
them:
and
the
magistrates
rent
off
their
clothes,
and
commanded
to
beat
them.
016:023
And
when
they
had
laid
many
stripes
upon
them,
they
cast
them
into
prison,
charging
the
jailor
to
keep
them
safely:
016:024
Who,
having
received
such
a
charge,
thrust
them
into
the
inner
prison,
and
made
their
feet
fast
in
the
stocks.
016:025
And
at
midnight
Paul
and
Silas
prayed,
and
sang
praises
unto
God:
and
the
prisoners
heard
them.
016:026
And
suddenly
there
was
a
great
earthquake,
so
that
the
foundations
of
the
prison
were
shaken:
and
immediately
all
the
doors
were
opened,
and
every
one's
bands
were
loosed.
016:027
And
the
keeper
of
the
prison
awaking
out
of
his
sleep,
and
seeing
the
prison
doors
open,
he
drew
out
his
sword,
and
would
have
killed
himself,
supposing
that
the
prisoners
had
been
fled.
016:028
But
Paul
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
saying,
Do
thyself
no
harm:
for
we
are
all
here.
016:029
Then
he
called
for
a
light,
and
sprang
in,
and
came
trembling,
and
fell
down
before
Paul
and
Silas,
016:030
And
brought
them
out,
and
said,
Sirs,
what
must
I
do
to
be
saved?
016:031
And
they
said,
Believe
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
and
thou
shalt
be
saved,
and
thy
house.
016:032
And
they
spake
unto
him
the
word
of
the
Lord,
and
to
all
that
were
in
his
house.
016:033
And
he
took
them
the
same
hour
of
the
night,
and
washed
their
stripes;
and
was
baptized,
he
and
all
his,
straightway.
016:034
And
when
he
had
brought
them
into
his
house,
he
set
meat
before
them,
and
rejoiced,
believing
in
God
with
all
his
house.
016:035
And
when
it
was
day,
the
magistrates
sent
the
serjeants,
saying,
Let
those
men
go.
016:036
And
the
keeper
of
the
prison
told
this
saying
to
Paul,
The
magistrates
have
sent
to
let
you
go:
now
therefore
depart,
and
go
in
peace.
016:037
But
Paul
said
unto
them,
They
have
beaten
us
openly
uncondemned,
being
Romans,
and
have
cast
us
into
prison;
and
now
do
they
thrust
us
out
privily?
nay
verily;
but
let
them
come
themselves
and
fetch
us
out.
016:038
And
the
serjeants
told
these
words
unto
the
magistrates:
and
they
feared,
when
they
heard
that
they
were
Romans.
016:039
And
they
came
and
besought
them,
and
brought
them
out,
and
desired
them
to
depart
out
of
the
city.
016:040
And
they
went
out
of
the
prison,
and
entered
into
the
house
of
Lydia:
and
when
they
had
seen
the
brethren,
they
comforted
them,
and
departed.
017:001
Now
when
they
had
passed
through
Amphipolis
and
Apollonia,
they
came
to
Thessalonica,
where
was
a
synagogue
of
the
Jews:
017:002
And
Paul,
as
his
manner
was,
went
in
unto
them,
and
three
sabbath
days
reasoned
with
them
out
of
the
scriptures,
017:003
Opening
and
alleging,
that
Christ
must
needs
have
suffered,
and
risen
again
from
the
dead;
and
that
this
Jesus,
whom
I
preach
unto
you,
is
Christ.
017:004
And
some
of
them
believed,
and
consorted
with
Paul
and
Silas;
and
of
the
devout
Greeks
a
great
multitude,
and
of
the
chief
women
not
a
few.
017:005
But
the
Jews
which
believed
not,
moved
with
envy,
took
unto
them
certain
lewd
fellows
of
the
baser
sort,
and
gathered
a
company,
and
set
all
the
city
on
an
uproar,
and
assaulted
the
house
of
Jason,
and
sought
to
bring
them
out
to
the
people.
017:006
And
when
they
found
them
not,
they
drew
Jason
and
certain
brethren
unto
the
rulers
of
the
city,
crying,
These
that
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
are
come
hither
also;
017:007
Whom
Jason
hath
received:
and
these
all
do
contrary
to
the
decrees
of
Caesar,
saying
that
there
is
another
king,
one
Jesus.
017:008
And
they
troubled
the
people
and
the
rulers
of
the
city,
when
they
heard
these
things.
017:009
And
when
they
had
taken
security
of
Jason,
and
of
the
other,
they
let
them
go.
017:010
And
the
brethren
immediately
sent
away
Paul
and
Silas
by
night
unto
Berea:
who
coming
thither
went
into
the
synagogue
of
the
Jews.
017:011
These
were
more
noble
than
those
in
Thessalonica,
in
that
they
received
the
word
with
all
readiness
of
mind,
and
searched
the
scriptures
daily,
whether
those
things
were
so.
017:012
Therefore
many
of
them
believed;
also
of
honourable
women
which
were
Greeks,
and
of
men,
not
a
few.
017:013
But
when
the
Jews
of
Thessalonica
had
knowledge
that
the
word
of
God
was
preached
of
Paul
at
Berea,
they
came
thither
also,
and
stirred
up
the
people.
017:014
And
then
immediately
the
brethren
sent
away
Paul
to
go
as
it
were
to
the
sea:
but
Silas
and
Timotheus
abode
there
still.
017:015
And
they
that
conducted
Paul
brought
him
unto
Athens:
and
receiving
a
commandment
unto
Silas
and
Timotheus
for
to
come
to
him
with
all
speed,
they
departed.
017:016
Now
while
Paul
waited
for
them
at
Athens,
his
spirit
was
stirred
in
him,
when
he
saw
the
city
wholly
given
to
idolatry.
017:017
Therefore
disputed
he
in
the
synagogue
with
the
Jews,
and
with
the
devout
persons,
and
in
the
market
daily
with
them
that
met
with
him.
017:018
Then
certain
philosophers
of
the
Epicureans,
and
of
the
Stoicks,
encountered
him.
And
some
said,
What
will
this
babbler
say?
other
some,
He
seemeth
to
be
a
setter
forth
of
strange
gods:
because
he
preached
unto
them
Jesus,
and
the
resurrection.
017:019
And
they
took
him,
and
brought
him
unto
Areopagus,
saying,
May
we
know
what
this
new
doctrine,
whereof
thou
speakest,
is?
017:020
For
thou
bringest
certain
strange
things
to
our
ears:
we
would
know
therefore
what
these
things
mean.
017:021
(For
all
the
Athenians
and
strangers
which
were
there
spent
their
time
in
nothing
else,
but
either
to
tell,
or
to
hear
some
new
thing.)
017:022
Then
Paul
stood
in
the
midst
of
Mars'
hill,
and
said,
Ye
men
of
Athens,
I
perceive
that
in
all
things
ye
are
too
superstitious.
017:023
For
as
I
passed
by,
and
beheld
your
devotions,
I
found
an
altar
with
this
inscription,
TO
THE
UNKNOWN
GOD.
Whom
therefore
ye
ignorantly
worship,
him
declare
I
unto
you.
017:024
God
that
made
the
world
and
all
things
therein,
seeing
that
he
is
Lord
of
heaven
and
earth,
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands;
017:025
Neither
is
worshipped
with
men's
hands,
as
though
he
needed
any
thing,
seeing
he
giveth
to
all
life,
and
breath,
and
all
things;
017:026
And
hath
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
for
to
dwell
on
all
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
hath
determined
the
times
before
appointed,
and
the
bounds
of
their
habitation;
017:027
That
they
should
seek
the
Lord,
if
haply
they
might
feel
after
him,
and
find
him,
though
he
be
not
far
from
every
one
of
us:
017:028
For
in
him
we
live,
and
move,
and
have
our
being;
as
certain
also
of
your
own
poets
have
said,
For
we
are
also
his
offspring.
017:029
Forasmuch
then
as
we
are
the
offspring
of
God,
we
ought
not
to
think
that
the
Godhead
is
like
unto
gold,
or
silver,
or
stone,
graven
by
art
and
man's
device.
017:030
And
the
times
of
this
ignorance
God
winked
at;
but
now
commandeth
all
men
every
where
to
repent:
017:031
Because
he
hath
appointed
a
day,
in
the
which
he
will
judge
the
world
in
righteousness
by
that
man
whom
he
hath
ordained;
whereof
he
hath
given
assurance
unto
all
men,
in
that
he
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead.
017:032
And
when
they
heard
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead,
some
mocked:
and
others
said,
We
will
hear
thee
again
of
this
matter.
017:033
So
Paul
departed
from
among
them.
017:034
Howbeit
certain
men
clave
unto
him,
and
believed:
among
the
which
was
Dionysius
the
Areopagite,
and
a
woman
named
Damaris,
and
others
with
them.
018:001
After
these
things
Paul
departed
from
Athens,
and
came
to
Corinth;
018:002
And
found
a
certain
Jew
named
Aquila,
born
in
Pontus,
lately
come
from
Italy,
with
his
wife
Priscilla;
(because
that
Claudius
had
commanded
all
Jews
to
depart
from
Rome:)
and
came
unto
them.
018:003
And
because
he
was
of
the
same
craft,
he
abode
with
them,
and
wrought:
for
by
their
occupation
they
were
tentmakers.
018:004
And
he
reasoned
in
the
synagogue
every
sabbath,
and
persuaded
the
Jews
and
the
Greeks.
018:005
And
when
Silas
and
Timotheus
were
come
from
Macedonia,
Paul
was
pressed
in
the
spirit,
and
testified
to
the
Jews
that
Jesus
was
Christ.
018:006
And
when
they
opposed
themselves,
and
blasphemed,
he
shook
his
raiment,
and
said
unto
them,
Your
blood
be
upon
your
own
heads;
I
am
clean;
from
henceforth
I
will
go
unto
the
Gentiles.
018:007
And
he
departed
thence,
and
entered
into
a
certain
man's
house,
named
Justus,
one
that
worshipped
God,
whose
house
joined
hard
to
the
synagogue.
018:008
And
Crispus,
the
chief
ruler
of
the
synagogue,
believed
on
the
Lord
with
all
his
house;
and
many
of
the
Corinthians
hearing
believed,
and
were
baptized.
018:009
Then
spake
the
Lord
to
Paul
in
the
night
by
a
vision,
Be
not
afraid,
but
speak,
and
hold
not
thy
peace:
018:010
For
I
am
with
thee,
and
no
man
shall
set
on
thee
to
hurt
thee:
for
I
have
much
people
in
this
city.
018:011
And
he
continued
there
a
year
and
six
months,
teaching
the
word
of
God
among
them.
018:012
And
when
Gallio
was
the
deputy
of
Achaia,
the
Jews
made
insurrection
with
one
accord
against
Paul,
and
brought
him
to
the
judgment
seat,
018:013
Saying,
This
fellow
persuadeth
men
to
worship
God
contrary
to
the
law.
018:014
And
when
Paul
was
now
about
to
open
his
mouth,
Gallio
said
unto
the
Jews,
If
it
were
a
matter
of
wrong
or
wicked
lewdness,
O
ye
Jews,
reason
would
that
I
should
bear
with
you:
018:015
But
if
it
be
a
question
of
words
and
names,
and
of
your
law,
look
ye
to
it;
for
I
will
be
no
judge
of
such
matters.
018:016
And
he
drave
them
from
the
judgment
seat.
018:017
Then
all
the
Greeks
took
Sosthenes,
the
chief
ruler
of
the
synagogue,
and
beat
him
before
the
judgment
seat.
And
Gallio
cared
for
none
of
those
things.
018:018
And
Paul
after
this
tarried
there
yet
a
good
while,
and
then
took
his
leave
of
the
brethren,
and
sailed
thence
into
Syria,
and
with
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila;
having
shorn
his
head
in
Cenchrea:
for
he
had
a
vow.
018:019
And
he
came
to
Ephesus,
and
left
them
there:
but
he
himself
entered
into
the
synagogue,
and
reasoned
with
the
Jews.
018:020
When
they
desired
him
to
tarry
longer
time
with
them,
he
consented
not;
018:021
But
bade
them
farewell,
saying,
I
must
by
all
means
keep
this
feast
that
cometh
in
Jerusalem:
but
I
will
return
again
unto
you,
if
God
will.
And
he
sailed
from
Ephesus.
018:022
And
when
he
had
landed
at
Caesarea,
and
gone
up,
and
saluted
the
church,
he
went
down
to
Antioch.
018:023
And
after
he
had
spent
some
time
there,
he
departed,
and
went
over
all
the
country
of
Galatia
and
Phrygia
in
order,
strengthening
all
the
disciples.
018:024
And
a
certain
Jew
named
Apollos,
born
at
Alexandria,
an
eloquent
man,
and
mighty
in
the
scriptures,
came
to
Ephesus.
018:025
This
man
was
instructed
in
the
way
of
the
Lord;
and
being
fervent
in
the
spirit,
he
spake
and
taught
diligently
the
things
of
the
Lord,
knowing
only
the
baptism
of
John.
018:026
And
he
began
to
speak
boldly
in
the
synagogue:
whom
when
Aquila
and
Priscilla
had
heard,
they
took
him
unto
them,
and
expounded
unto
him
the
way
of
God
more
perfectly.
018:027
And
when
he
was
disposed
to
pass
into
Achaia,
the
brethren
wrote,
exhorting
the
disciples
to
receive
him:
who,
when
he
was
come,
helped
them
much
which
had
believed
through
grace:
018:028
For
he
mightily
convinced
the
Jews,
and
that
publickly,
shewing
by
the
scriptures
that
Jesus
was
Christ.
019:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
while
Apollos
was
at
Corinth,
Paul
having
passed
through
the
upper
coasts
came
to
Ephesus:
and
finding
certain
disciples,
019:002
He
said
unto
them,
Have
ye
received
the
Holy
Ghost
since
ye
believed?
And
they
said
unto
him,
We
have
not
so
much
as
heard
whether
there
be
any
Holy
Ghost.
019:003
And
he
said
unto
them,
Unto
what
then
were
ye
baptized?
And
they
said,
Unto
John's
baptism.
019:004
Then
said
Paul,
John
verily
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
repentance,
saying
unto
the
people,
that
they
should
believe
on
him
which
should
come
after
him,
that
is,
on
Christ
Jesus.
019:005
When
they
heard
this,
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus.
019:006
And
when
Paul
had
laid
his
hands
upon
them,
the
Holy
Ghost
came
on
them;
and
they
spake
with
tongues,
and
prophesied.
019:007
And
all
the
men
were
about
twelve.
019:008
And
he
went
into
the
synagogue,
and
spake
boldly
for
the
space
of
three
months,
disputing
and
persuading
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
God.
019:009
But
when
divers
were
hardened,
and
believed
not,
but
spake
evil
of
that
way
before
the
multitude,
he
departed
from
them,
and
separated
the
disciples,
disputing
daily
in
the
school
of
one
Tyrannus.
019:010
And
this
continued
by
the
space
of
two
years;
so
that
all
they
which
dwelt
in
Asia
heard
the
word
of
the
Lord
Jesus,
both
Jews
and
Greeks.
019:011
And
God
wrought
special
miracles
by
the
hands
of
Paul:
019:012
So
that
from
his
body
were
brought
unto
the
sick
handkerchiefs
or
aprons,
and
the
diseases
departed
from
them,
and
the
evil
spirits
went
out
of
them.
019:013
Then
certain
of
the
vagabond
Jews,
exorcists,
took
upon
them
to
call
over
them
which
had
evil
spirits
the
name
of
the
LORD
Jesus,
saying,
We
adjure
you
by
Jesus
whom
Paul
preacheth.
019:014
And
there
were
seven
sons
of
one
Sceva,
a
Jew,
and
chief
of
the
priests,
which
did
so.
019:015
And
the
evil
spirit
answered
and
said,
Jesus
I
know,
and
Paul
I
know;
but
who
are
ye?
019:016
And
the
man
in
whom
the
evil
spirit
was
leaped
on
them,
and
overcame
them,
and
prevailed
against
them,
so
that
they
fled
out
of
that
house
naked
and
wounded.
019:017
And
this
was
known
to
all
the
Jews
and
Greeks
also
dwelling
at
Ephesus;
and
fear
fell
on
them
all,
and
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus
was
magnified.
019:018
And
many
that
believed
came,
and
confessed,
and
shewed
their
deeds.
019:019
Many
of
them
also
which
used
curious
arts
brought
their
books
together,
and
burned
them
before
all
men:
and
they
counted
the
price
of
them,
and
found
it
fifty
thousand
pieces
of
silver.
019:020
So
mightily
grew
the
word
of
God
and
prevailed.
019:021
After
these
things
were
ended,
Paul
purposed
in
the
spirit,
when
he
had
passed
through
Macedonia
and
Achaia,
to
go
to
Jerusalem,
saying,
After
I
have
been
there,
I
must
also
see
Rome.
019:022
So
he
sent
into
Macedonia
two
of
them
that
ministered
unto
him,
Timotheus
and
Erastus;
but
he
himself
stayed
in
Asia
for
a
season.
019:023
And
the
same
time
there
arose
no
small
stir
about
that
way.
019:024
For
a
certain
man
named
Demetrius,
a
silversmith,
which
made
silver
shrines
for
Diana,
brought
no
small
gain
unto
the
craftsmen;
019:025
Whom
he
called
together
with
the
workmen
of
like
occupation,
and
said,
Sirs,
ye
know
that
by
this
craft
we
have
our
wealth.
019:026
Moreover
ye
see
and
hear,
that
not
alone
at
Ephesus,
but
almost
throughout
all
Asia,
this
Paul
hath
persuaded
and
turned
away
much
people,
saying
that
they
be
no
gods,
which
are
