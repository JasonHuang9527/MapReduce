the
tent
of
the
congregation,
and
when
they
came
near
unto
the
altar,
they
washed;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
040:033
And
he
reared
up
the
court
round
about
the
tabernacle
and
the
altar,
and
set
up
the
hanging
of
the
court
gate.
So
Moses
finished
the
work.
040:034
Then
a
cloud
covered
the
tent
of
the
congregation,
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
filled
the
tabernacle.
040:035
And
Moses
was
not
able
to
enter
into
the
tent
of
the
congregation,
because
the
cloud
abode
thereon,
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
filled
the
tabernacle.
040:036
And
when
the
cloud
was
taken
up
from
over
the
tabernacle,
the
children
of
Israel
went
onward
in
all
their
journeys:
040:037
But
if
the
cloud
were
not
taken
up,
then
they
journeyed
not
till
the
day
that
it
was
taken
up.
040:038
For
the
cloud
of
the
LORD
was
upon
the
tabernacle
by
day,
and
fire
was
on
it
by
night,
in
the
sight
of
all
the
house
of
Israel,
throughout
all
their
journeys.
Book
03	Leviticus
001:001
And
the
LORD
called
unto
Moses,
and
spake
unto
him
out
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
saying,
001:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
If
any
man
of
you
bring
an
offering
unto
the
LORD,
ye
shall
bring
your
offering
of
the
cattle,
even
of
the
herd,
and
of
the
flock.
001:003
If
his
offering
be
a
burnt
sacrifice
of
the
herd,
let
him
offer
a
male
without
blemish:
he
shall
offer
it
of
his
own
voluntary
will
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
the
LORD.
001:004
And
he
shall
put
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
the
burnt
offering;
and
it
shall
be
accepted
for
him
to
make
atonement
for
him.
001:005
And
he
shall
kill
the
bullock
before
the
LORD:
and
the
priests,
Aaron's
sons,
shall
bring
the
blood,
and
sprinkle
the
blood
round
about
upon
the
altar
that
is
by
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
001:006
And
he
shall
flay
the
burnt
offering,
and
cut
it
into
his
pieces.
001:007
And
the
sons
of
Aaron
the
priest
shall
put
fire
upon
the
altar,
and
lay
the
wood
in
order
upon
the
fire:
001:008
And
the
priests,
Aaron's
sons,
shall
lay
the
parts,
the
head,
and
the
fat,
in
order
upon
the
wood
that
is
on
the
fire
which
is
upon
the
altar:
001:009
But
his
inwards
and
his
legs
shall
he
wash
in
water:
and
the
priest
shall
burn
all
on
the
altar,
to
be
a
burnt
sacrifice,
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
001:010
And
if
his
offering
be
of
the
flocks,
namely,
of
the
sheep,
or
of
the
goats,
for
a
burnt
sacrifice;
he
shall
bring
it
a
male
without
blemish.
001:011
And
he
shall
kill
it
on
the
side
of
the
altar
northward
before
the
LORD:
and
the
priests,
Aaron's
sons,
shall
sprinkle
his
blood
round
about
upon
the
altar.
001:012
And
he
shall
cut
it
into
his
pieces,
with
his
head
and
his
fat:
and
the
priest
shall
lay
them
in
order
on
the
wood
that
is
on
the
fire
which
is
upon
the
altar:
001:013
But
he
shall
wash
the
inwards
and
the
legs
with
water:
and
the
priest
shall
bring
it
all,
and
burn
it
upon
the
altar:
it
is
a
burnt
sacrifice,
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
001:014
And
if
the
burnt
sacrifice
for
his
offering
to
the
LORD
be
of
fowls,
then
he
shall
bring
his
offering
of
turtledoves,
or
of
young
pigeons.
001:015
And
the
priest
shall
bring
it
unto
the
altar,
and
wring
off
his
head,
and
burn
it
on
the
altar;
and
the
blood
thereof
shall
be
wrung
out
at
the
side
of
the
altar:
001:016
And
he
shall
pluck
away
his
crop
with
his
feathers,
and
cast
it
beside
the
altar
on
the
east
part,
by
the
place
of
the
ashes:
001:017
And
he
shall
cleave
it
with
the
wings
thereof,
but
shall
not
divide
it
asunder:
and
the
priest
shall
burn
it
upon
the
altar,
upon
the
wood
that
is
upon
the
fire:
it
is
a
burnt
sacrifice,
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
002:001
And
when
any
will
offer
a
meat
offering
unto
the
LORD,
his
offering
shall
be
of
fine
flour;
and
he
shall
pour
oil
upon
it,
and
put
frankincense
thereon:
002:002
And
he
shall
bring
it
to
Aaron's
sons
the
priests:
and
he
shall
take
thereout
his
handful
of
the
flour
thereof,
and
of
the
oil
thereof,
with
all
the
frankincense
thereof;
and
the
priest
shall
burn
the
memorial
of
it
upon
the
altar,
to
be
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD:
002:003
And
the
remnant
of
the
meat
offering
shall
be
Aaron's
and
his
sons':
it
is
a
thing
most
holy
of
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire.
002:004
And
if
thou
bring
an
oblation
of
a
meat
offering
baken
in
the
oven,
it
shall
be
unleavened
cakes
of
fine
flour
mingled
with
oil,
or
unleavened
wafers
anointed
with
oil.
002:005
And
if
thy
oblation
be
a
meat
offering
baken
in
a
pan,
it
shall
be
of
fine
flour
unleavened,
mingled
with
oil.
002:006
Thou
shalt
part
it
in
pieces,
and
pour
oil
thereon:
it
is
a
meat
offering.
002:007
And
if
thy
oblation
be
a
meat
offering
baken
in
the
fryingpan,
it
shall
be
made
of
fine
flour
with
oil.
002:008
And
thou
shalt
bring
the
meat
offering
that
is
made
of
these
things
unto
the
LORD:
and
when
it
is
presented
unto
the
priest,
he
shall
bring
it
unto
the
altar.
002:009
And
the
priest
shall
take
from
the
meat
offering
a
memorial
thereof,
and
shall
burn
it
upon
the
altar:
it
is
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
002:010
And
that
which
is
left
of
the
meat
offering
shall
be
Aaron's
and
his
sons':
it
is
a
thing
most
holy
of
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire.
002:011
No
meat
offering,
which
ye
shall
bring
unto
the
LORD,
shall
be
made
with
leaven:
for
ye
shall
burn
no
leaven,
nor
any
honey,
in
any
offering
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire.
002:012
As
for
the
oblation
of
the
firstfruits,
ye
shall
offer
them
unto
the
LORD:
but
they
shall
not
be
burnt
on
the
altar
for
a
sweet
savour.
002:013
And
every
oblation
of
thy
meat
offering
shalt
thou
season
with
salt;
neither
shalt
thou
suffer
the
salt
of
the
covenant
of
thy
God
to
be
lacking
from
thy
meat
offering:
with
all
thine
offerings
thou
shalt
offer
salt.
002:014
And
if
thou
offer
a
meat
offering
of
thy
firstfruits
unto
the
LORD,
thou
shalt
offer
for
the
meat
offering
of
thy
firstfruits
green
ears
of
corn
dried
by
the
fire,
even
corn
beaten
out
of
full
ears.
002:015
And
thou
shalt
put
oil
upon
it,
and
lay
frankincense
thereon:
it
is
a
meat
offering.
002:016
And
the
priest
shall
burn
the
memorial
of
it,
part
of
the
beaten
corn
thereof,
and
part
of
the
oil
thereof,
with
all
the
frankincense
thereof:
it
is
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
003:001
And
if
his
oblation
be
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offering,
if
he
offer
it
of
the
herd;
whether
it
be
a
male
or
female,
he
shall
offer
it
without
blemish
before
the
LORD.
003:002
And
he
shall
lay
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
his
offering,
and
kill
it
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
Aaron's
sons
the
priests
shall
sprinkle
the
blood
upon
the
altar
round
about.
003:003
And
he
shall
offer
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
peace
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD;
the
fat
that
covereth
the
inwards,
and
all
the
fat
that
is
upon
the
inwards,
003:004
And
the
two
kidneys,
and
the
fat
that
is
on
them,
which
is
by
the
flanks,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver,
with
the
kidneys,
it
shall
he
take
away.
003:005
And
Aaron's
sons
shall
burn
it
on
the
altar
upon
the
burnt
sacrifice,
which
is
upon
the
wood
that
is
on
the
fire:
it
is
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
003:006
And
if
his
offering
for
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offering
unto
the
LORD
be
of
the
flock;
male
or
female,
he
shall
offer
it
without
blemish.
003:007
If
he
offer
a
lamb
for
his
offering,
then
shall
he
offer
it
before
the
LORD.
003:008
And
he
shall
lay
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
his
offering,
and
kill
it
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
Aaron's
sons
shall
sprinkle
the
blood
thereof
round
about
upon
the
altar.
003:009
And
he
shall
offer
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
peace
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD;
the
fat
thereof,
and
the
whole
rump,
it
shall
he
take
off
hard
by
the
backbone;
and
the
fat
that
covereth
the
inwards,
and
all
the
fat
that
is
upon
the
inwards,
003:010
And
the
two
kidneys,
and
the
fat
that
is
upon
them,
which
is
by
the
flanks,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver,
with
the
kidneys,
it
shall
he
take
away.
003:011
And
the
priest
shall
burn
it
upon
the
altar:
it
is
the
food
of
the
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
003:012
And
if
his
offering
be
a
goat,
then
he
shall
offer
it
before
the
LORD.
003:013
And
he
shall
lay
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
it,
and
kill
it
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
the
sons
of
Aaron
shall
sprinkle
the
blood
thereof
upon
the
altar
round
about.
003:014
And
he
shall
offer
thereof
his
offering,
even
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD;
the
fat
that
covereth
the
inwards,
and
all
the
fat
that
is
upon
the
inwards,
003:015
And
the
two
kidneys,
and
the
fat
that
is
upon
them,
which
is
by
the
flanks,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver,
with
the
kidneys,
it
shall
he
take
away.
003:016
And
the
priest
shall
burn
them
upon
the
altar:
it
is
the
food
of
the
offering
made
by
fire
for
a
sweet
savour:
all
the
fat
is
the
LORD's.
003:017
It
shall
be
a
perpetual
statute
for
your
generations
throughout
all
your
dwellings,
that
ye
eat
neither
fat
nor
blood.
004:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
004:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
If
a
soul
shall
sin
through
ignorance
against
any
of
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
concerning
things
which
ought
not
to
be
done,
and
shall
do
against
any
of
them:
004:003
If
the
priest
that
is
anointed
do
sin
according
to
the
sin
of
the
people;
then
let
him
bring
for
his
sin,
which
he
hath
sinned,
a
young
bullock
without
blemish
unto
the
LORD
for
a
sin
offering.
004:004
And
he
shall
bring
the
bullock
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
the
LORD;
and
shall
lay
his
hand
upon
the
bullock's
head,
and
kill
the
bullock
before
the
LORD.
004:005
And
the
priest
that
is
anointed
shall
take
of
the
bullock's
blood,
and
bring
it
to
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
004:006
And
the
priest
shall
dip
his
finger
in
the
blood,
and
sprinkle
of
the
blood
seven
times
before
the
LORD,
before
the
vail
of
the
sanctuary.
004:007
And
the
priest
shall
put
some
of
the
blood
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar
of
sweet
incense
before
the
LORD,
which
is
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation;
and
shall
pour
all
the
blood
of
the
bullock
at
the
bottom
of
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering,
which
is
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
004:008
And
he
shall
take
off
from
it
all
the
fat
of
the
bullock
for
the
sin
offering;
the
fat
that
covereth
the
inwards,
and
all
the
fat
that
is
upon
the
inwards,
004:009
And
the
two
kidneys,
and
the
fat
that
is
upon
them,
which
is
by
the
flanks,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver,
with
the
kidneys,
it
shall
he
take
away,
004:010
As
it
was
taken
off
from
the
bullock
of
the
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings:
and
the
priest
shall
burn
them
upon
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering.
004:011
And
the
skin
of
the
bullock,
and
all
his
flesh,
with
his
head,
and
with
his
legs,
and
his
inwards,
and
his
dung,
004:012
Even
the
whole
bullock
shall
he
carry
forth
without
the
camp
unto
a
clean
place,
where
the
ashes
are
poured
out,
and
burn
him
on
the
wood
with
fire:
where
the
ashes
are
poured
out
shall
he
be
burnt.
004:013
And
if
the
whole
congregation
of
Israel
sin
through
ignorance,
and
the
thing
be
hid
from
the
eyes
of
the
assembly,
and
they
have
done
somewhat
against
any
of
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
concerning
things
which
should
not
be
done,
and
are
guilty;
004:014
When
the
sin,
which
they
have
sinned
against
it,
is
known,
then
the
congregation
shall
offer
a
young
bullock
for
the
sin,
and
bring
him
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
004:015
And
the
elders
of
the
congregation
shall
lay
their
hands
upon
the
head
of
the
bullock
before
the
LORD:
and
the
bullock
shall
be
killed
before
the
LORD.
004:016
And
the
priest
that
is
anointed
shall
bring
of
the
bullock's
blood
to
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
004:017
And
the
priest
shall
dip
his
finger
in
some
of
the
blood,
and
sprinkle
it
seven
times
before
the
LORD,
even
before
the
vail.
004:018
And
he
shall
put
some
of
the
blood
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar
which
is
before
the
LORD,
that
is
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
shall
pour
out
all
the
blood
at
the
bottom
of
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering,
which
is
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
004:019
And
he
shall
take
all
his
fat
from
him,
and
burn
it
upon
the
altar.
004:020
And
he
shall
do
with
the
bullock
as
he
did
with
the
bullock
for
a
sin
offering,
so
shall
he
do
with
this:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
them,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
them.
004:021
And
he
shall
carry
forth
the
bullock
without
the
camp,
and
burn
him
as
he
burned
the
first
bullock:
it
is
a
sin
offering
for
the
congregation.
004:022
When
a
ruler
hath
sinned,
and
done
somewhat
through
ignorance
against
any
of
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
his
God
concerning
things
which
should
not
be
done,
and
is
guilty;
004:023
Or
if
his
sin,
wherein
he
hath
sinned,
come
to
his
knowledge;
he
shall
bring
his
offering,
a
kid
of
the
goats,
a
male
without
blemish:
004:024
And
he
shall
lay
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
the
goat,
and
kill
it
in
the
place
where
they
kill
the
burnt
offering
before
the
LORD:
it
is
a
sin
offering.
004:025
And
the
priest
shall
take
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
with
his
finger,
and
put
it
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering,
and
shall
pour
out
his
blood
at
the
bottom
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering.
004:026
And
he
shall
burn
all
his
fat
upon
the
altar,
as
the
fat
of
the
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
as
concerning
his
sin,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him.
004:027
And
if
any
one
of
the
common
people
sin
through
ignorance,
while
he
doeth
somewhat
against
any
of
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
concerning
things
which
ought
not
to
be
done,
and
be
guilty;
004:028
Or
if
his
sin,
which
he
hath
sinned,
come
to
his
knowledge:
then
he
shall
bring
his
offering,
a
kid
of
the
goats,
a
female
without
blemish,
for
his
sin
which
he
hath
sinned.
004:029
And
he
shall
lay
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
the
sin
offering,
and
slay
the
sin
offering
in
the
place
of
the
burnt
offering.
004:030
And
the
priest
shall
take
of
the
blood
thereof
with
his
finger,
and
put
it
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering,
and
shall
pour
out
all
the
blood
thereof
at
the
bottom
of
the
altar.
004:031
And
he
shall
take
away
all
the
fat
thereof,
as
the
fat
is
taken
away
from
off
the
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings;
and
the
priest
shall
burn
it
upon
the
altar
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD;
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him.
004:032
And
if
he
bring
a
lamb
for
a
sin
offering,
he
shall
bring
it
a
female
without
blemish.
004:033
And
he
shall
lay
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
the
sin
offering,
and
slay
it
for
a
sin
offering
in
the
place
where
they
kill
the
burnt
offering.
004:034
And
the
priest
shall
take
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
with
his
finger,
and
put
it
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering,
and
shall
pour
out
all
the
blood
thereof
at
the
bottom
of
the
altar:
004:035
And
he
shall
take
away
all
the
fat
thereof,
as
the
fat
of
the
lamb
is
taken
away
from
the
sacrifice
of
the
peace
offerings;
and
the
priest
shall
burn
them
upon
the
altar,
according
to
the
offerings
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
his
sin
that
he
hath
committed,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him.
005:001
And
if
a
soul
sin,
and
hear
the
voice
of
swearing,
and
is
a
witness,
whether
he
hath
seen
or
known
of
it;
if
he
do
not
utter
it,
then
he
shall
bear
his
iniquity.
005:002
Or
if
a
soul
touch
any
unclean
thing,
whether
it
be
a
carcase
of
an
unclean
beast,
or
a
carcase
of
unclean
cattle,
or
the
carcase
of
unclean
creeping
things,
and
if
it
be
hidden
from
him;
he
also
shall
be
unclean,
and
guilty.
005:003
Or
if
he
touch
the
uncleanness
of
man,
whatsoever
uncleanness
it
be
that
a
man
shall
be
defiled
withal,
and
it
be
hid
from
him;
when
he
knoweth
of
it,
then
he
shall
be
guilty.
005:004
Or
if
a
soul
swear,
pronouncing
with
his
lips
to
do
evil,
or
to
do
good,
whatsoever
it
be
that
a
man
shall
pronounce
with
an
oath,
and
it
be
hid
from
him;
when
he
knoweth
of
it,
then
he
shall
be
guilty
in
one
of
these.
005:005
And
it
shall
be,
when
he
shall
be
guilty
in
one
of
these
things,
that
he
shall
confess
that
he
hath
sinned
in
that
thing:
005:006
And
he
shall
bring
his
trespass
offering
unto
the
LORD
for
his
sin
which
he
hath
sinned,
a
female
from
the
flock,
a
lamb
or
a
kid
of
the
goats,
for
a
sin
offering;
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
concerning
his
sin.
005:007
And
if
he
be
not
able
to
bring
a
lamb,
then
he
shall
bring
for
his
trespass,
which
he
hath
committed,
two
turtledoves,
or
two
young
pigeons,
unto
the
LORD;
one
for
a
sin
offering,
and
the
other
for
a
burnt
offering.
005:008
And
he
shall
bring
them
unto
the
priest,
who
shall
offer
that
which
is
for
the
sin
offering
first,
and
wring
off
his
head
from
his
neck,
but
shall
not
divide
it
asunder:
005:009
And
he
shall
sprinkle
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
upon
the
side
of
the
altar;
and
the
rest
of
the
blood
shall
be
wrung
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
altar:
it
is
a
sin
offering.
005:010
And
he
shall
offer
the
second
for
a
burnt
offering,
according
to
the
manner:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
for
his
sin
which
he
hath
sinned,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him.
005:011
But
if
he
be
not
able
to
bring
two
turtledoves,
or
two
young
pigeons,
then
he
that
sinned
shall
bring
for
his
offering
the
tenth
part
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
for
a
sin
offering;
he
shall
put
no
oil
upon
it,
neither
shall
he
put
any
frankincense
thereon:
for
it
is
a
sin
offering.
005:012
Then
shall
he
bring
it
to
the
priest,
and
the
priest
shall
take
his
handful
of
it,
even
a
memorial
thereof,
and
burn
it
on
the
altar,
according
to
the
offerings
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD:
it
is
a
sin
offering.
005:013
And
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
as
touching
his
sin
that
he
hath
sinned
in
one
of
these,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him:
and
the
remnant
shall
be
the
priest's,
as
a
meat
offering.
005:014
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
005:015
If
a
soul
commit
a
trespass,
and
sin
through
ignorance,
in
the
holy
things
of
the
LORD;
then
he
shall
bring
for
his
trespass
unto
the
LORD
a
ram
without
blemish
out
of
the
flocks,
with
thy
estimation
by
shekels
of
silver,
after
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary,
for
a
trespass
offering.
005:016
And
he
shall
make
amends
for
the
harm
that
he
hath
done
in
the
holy
thing,
and
shall
add
the
fifth
part
thereto,
and
give
it
unto
the
priest:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
with
the
ram
of
the
trespass
offering,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him.
005:017
And
if
a
soul
sin,
and
commit
any
of
these
things
which
are
forbidden
to
be
done
by
the
commandments
of
the
LORD;
though
he
wist
it
not,
yet
is
he
guilty,
and
shall
bear
his
iniquity.
005:018
And
he
shall
bring
a
ram
without
blemish
out
of
the
flock,
with
thy
estimation,
for
a
trespass
offering,
unto
the
priest:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
concerning
his
ignorance
wherein
he
erred
and
wist
it
not,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him.
005:019
It
is
a
trespass
offering:
he
hath
certainly
trespassed
against
the
LORD.
006:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
006:002
If
a
soul
sin,
and
commit
a
trespass
against
the
LORD,
and
lie
unto
his
neighbour
in
that
which
was
delivered
him
to
keep,
or
in
fellowship,
or
in
a
thing
taken
away
by
violence,
or
hath
deceived
his
neighbour;
006:003
Or
have
found
that
which
was
lost,
and
lieth
concerning
it,
and
sweareth
falsely;
in
any
of
all
these
that
a
man
doeth,
sinning
therein:
006:004
Then
it
shall
be,
because
he
hath
sinned,
and
is
guilty,
that
he
shall
restore
that
which
he
took
violently
away,
or
the
thing
which
he
hath
deceitfully
gotten,
or
that
which
was
delivered
him
to
keep,
or
the
lost
thing
which
he
found,
006:005
Or
all
that
about
which
he
hath
sworn
falsely;
he
shall
even
restore
it
in
the
principal,
and
shall
add
the
fifth
part
more
thereto,
and
give
it
unto
him
to
whom
it
appertaineth,
in
the
day
of
his
trespass
offering.
006:006
And
he
shall
bring
his
trespass
offering
unto
the
LORD,
a
ram
without
blemish
out
of
the
flock,
with
thy
estimation,
for
a
trespass
offering,
unto
the
priest:
006:007
And
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
before
the
LORD:
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him
for
any
thing
of
all
that
he
hath
done
in
trespassing
therein.
006:008
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
006:009
Command
Aaron
and
his
sons,
saying,
This
is
the
law
of
the
burnt
offering:
It
is
the
burnt
offering,
because
of
the
burning
upon
the
altar
all
night
unto
the
morning,
and
the
fire
of
the
altar
shall
be
burning
in
it.
006:010
And
the
priest
shall
put
on
his
linen
garment,
and
his
linen
breeches
shall
he
put
upon
his
flesh,
and
take
up
the
ashes
which
the
fire
hath
consumed
with
the
burnt
offering
on
the
altar,
and
he
shall
put
them
beside
the
altar.
006:011
And
he
shall
put
off
his
garments,
and
put
on
other
garments,
and
carry
forth
the
ashes
without
the
camp
unto
a
clean
place.
006:012
And
the
fire
upon
the
altar
shall
be
burning
in
it;
it
shall
not
be
put
out:
and
the
priest
shall
burn
wood
on
it
every
morning,
and
lay
the
burnt
offering
in
order
upon
it;
and
he
shall
burn
thereon
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings.
006:013
The
fire
shall
ever
be
burning
upon
the
altar;
it
shall
never
go
out.
006:014
And
this
is
the
law
of
the
meat
offering:
the
