made
with
hands:
019:027
So
that
not
only
this
our
craft
is
in
danger
to
be
set
at
nought;
but
also
that
the
temple
of
the
great
goddess
Diana
should
be
despised,
and
her
magnificence
should
be
destroyed,
whom
all
Asia
and
the
world
worshippeth.
019:028
And
when
they
heard
these
sayings,
they
were
full
of
wrath,
and
cried
out,
saying,
Great
is
Diana
of
the
Ephesians.
019:029
And
the
whole
city
was
filled
with
confusion:
and
having
caught
Gaius
and
Aristarchus,
men
of
Macedonia,
Paul's
companions
in
travel,
they
rushed
with
one
accord
into
the
theatre.
019:030
And
when
Paul
would
have
entered
in
unto
the
people,
the
disciples
suffered
him
not.
019:031
And
certain
of
the
chief
of
Asia,
which
were
his
friends,
sent
unto
him,
desiring
him
that
he
would
not
adventure
himself
into
the
theatre.
019:032
Some
therefore
cried
one
thing,
and
some
another:
for
the
assembly
was
confused:
and
the
more
part
knew
not
wherefore
they
were
come
together.
019:033
And
they
drew
Alexander
out
of
the
multitude,
the
Jews
putting
him
forward.
And
Alexander
beckoned
with
the
hand,
and
would
have
made
his
defence
unto
the
people.
019:034
But
when
they
knew
that
he
was
a
Jew,
all
with
one
voice
about
the
space
of
two
hours
cried
out,
Great
is
Diana
of
the
Ephesians.
019:035
And
when
the
townclerk
had
appeased
the
people,
he
said,
Ye
men
of
Ephesus,
what
man
is
there
that
knoweth
not
how
that
the
city
of
the
Ephesians
is
a
worshipper
of
the
great
goddess
Diana,
and
of
the
image
which
fell
down
from
Jupiter?
019:036
Seeing
then
that
these
things
cannot
be
spoken
against,
ye
ought
to
be
quiet,
and
to
do
nothing
rashly.
019:037
For
ye
have
brought
hither
these
men,
which
are
neither
robbers
of
churches,
nor
yet
blasphemers
of
your
goddess.
019:038
Wherefore
if
Demetrius,
and
the
craftsmen
which
are
with
him,
have
a
matter
against
any
man,
the
law
is
open,
and
there
are
deputies:
let
them
implead
one
another.
019:039
But
if
ye
enquire
any
thing
concerning
other
matters,
it
shall
be
determined
in
a
lawful
assembly.
019:040
For
we
are
in
danger
to
be
called
in
question
for
this
day's
uproar,
there
being
no
cause
whereby
we
may
give
an
account
of
this
concourse.
019:041
And
when
he
had
thus
spoken,
he
dismissed
the
assembly.
020:001
And
after
the
uproar
was
ceased,
Paul
called
unto
him
the
disciples,
and
embraced
them,
and
departed
for
to
go
into
Macedonia.
020:002
And
when
he
had
gone
over
those
parts,
and
had
given
them
much
exhortation,
he
came
into
Greece,
020:003
And
there
abode
three
months.
And
when
the
Jews
laid
wait
for
him,
as
he
was
about
to
sail
into
Syria,
he
purposed
to
return
through
Macedonia.
020:004
And
there
accompanied
him
into
Asia
Sopater
of
Berea;
and
of
the
Thessalonians,
Aristarchus
and
Secundus;
and
Gaius
of
Derbe,
and
Timotheus;
and
of
Asia,
Tychicus
and
Trophimus.
020:005
These
going
before
tarried
for
us
at
Troas.
020:006
And
we
sailed
away
from
Philippi
after
the
days
of
unleavened
bread,
and
came
unto
them
to
Troas
in
five
days;
where
we
abode
seven
days.
020:007
And
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week,
when
the
disciples
came
together
to
break
bread,
Paul
preached
unto
them,
ready
to
depart
on
the
morrow;
and
continued
his
speech
until
midnight.
020:008
And
there
were
many
lights
in
the
upper
chamber,
where
they
were
gathered
together.
020:009
And
there
sat
in
a
window
a
certain
young
man
named
Eutychus,
being
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep:
and
as
Paul
was
long
preaching,
he
sunk
down
with
sleep,
and
fell
down
from
the
third
loft,
and
was
taken
up
dead.
020:010
And
Paul
went
down,
and
fell
on
him,
and
embracing
him
said,
Trouble
not
yourselves;
for
his
life
is
in
him.
020:011
When
he
therefore
was
come
up
again,
and
had
broken
bread,
and
eaten,
and
talked
a
long
while,
even
till
break
of
day,
so
he
departed.
020:012
And
they
brought
the
young
man
alive,
and
were
not
a
little
comforted.
020:013
And
we
went
before
to
ship,
and
sailed
unto
Assos,
there
intending
to
take
in
Paul:
for
so
had
he
appointed,
minding
himself
to
go
afoot.
020:014
And
when
he
met
with
us
at
Assos,
we
took
him
in,
and
came
to
Mitylene.
020:015
And
we
sailed
thence,
and
came
the
next
day
over
against
Chios;
and
the
next
day
we
arrived
at
Samos,
and
tarried
at
Trogyllium;
and
the
next
day
we
came
to
Miletus.
020:016
For
Paul
had
determined
to
sail
by
Ephesus,
because
he
would
not
spend
the
time
in
Asia:
for
he
hasted,
if
it
were
possible
for
him,
to
be
at
Jerusalem
the
day
of
Pentecost.
020:017
And
from
Miletus
he
sent
to
Ephesus,
and
called
the
elders
of
the
church.
020:018
And
when
they
were
come
to
him,
he
said
unto
them,
Ye
know,
from
the
first
day
that
I
came
into
Asia,
after
what
manner
I
have
been
with
you
at
all
seasons,
020:019
Serving
the
LORD
with
all
humility
of
mind,
and
with
many
tears,
and
temptations,
which
befell
me
by
the
lying
in
wait
of
the
Jews:
020:020
And
how
I
kept
back
nothing
that
was
profitable
unto
you,
but
have
shewed
you,
and
have
taught
you
publickly,
and
from
house
to
house,
020:021
Testifying
both
to
the
Jews,
and
also
to
the
Greeks,
repentance
toward
God,
and
faith
toward
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
020:022
And
now,
behold,
I
go
bound
in
the
spirit
unto
Jerusalem,
not
knowing
the
things
that
shall
befall
me
there:
020:023
Save
that
the
Holy
Ghost
witnesseth
in
every
city,
saying
that
bonds
and
afflictions
abide
me.
020:024
But
none
of
these
things
move
me,
neither
count
I
my
life
dear
unto
myself,
so
that
I
might
finish
my
course
with
joy,
and
the
ministry,
which
I
have
received
of
the
Lord
Jesus,
to
testify
the
gospel
of
the
grace
of
God.
020:025
And
now,
behold,
I
know
that
ye
all,
among
whom
I
have
gone
preaching
the
kingdom
of
God,
shall
see
my
face
no
more.
020:026
Wherefore
I
take
you
to
record
this
day,
that
I
am
pure
from
the
blood
of
all
men.
020:027
For
I
have
not
shunned
to
declare
unto
you
all
the
counsel
of
God.
020:028
Take
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves,
and
to
all
the
flock,
over
the
which
the
Holy
Ghost
hath
made
you
overseers,
to
feed
the
church
of
God,
which
he
hath
purchased
with
his
own
blood.
020:029
For
I
know
this,
that
after
my
departing
shall
grievous
wolves
enter
in
among
you,
not
sparing
the
flock.
020:030
Also
of
your
own
selves
shall
men
arise,
speaking
perverse
things,
to
draw
away
disciples
after
them.
020:031
Therefore
watch,
and
remember,
that
by
the
space
of
three
years
I
ceased
not
to
warn
every
one
night
and
day
with
tears.
020:032
And
now,
brethren,
I
commend
you
to
God,
and
to
the
word
of
his
grace,
which
is
able
to
build
you
up,
and
to
give
you
an
inheritance
among
all
them
which
are
sanctified.
020:033
I
have
coveted
no
man's
silver,
or
gold,
or
apparel.
020:034
Yea,
ye
yourselves
know,
that
these
hands
have
ministered
unto
my
necessities,
and
to
them
that
were
with
me.
020:035
I
have
shewed
you
all
things,
how
that
so
labouring
ye
ought
to
support
the
weak,
and
to
remember
the
words
of
the
Lord
Jesus,
how
he
said,
It
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive.
020:036
And
when
he
had
thus
spoken,
he
kneeled
down,
and
prayed
with
them
all.
020:037
And
they
all
wept
sore,
and
fell
on
Paul's
neck,
and
kissed
him,
020:038
Sorrowing
most
of
all
for
the
words
which
he
spake,
that
they
should
see
his
face
no
more.
And
they
accompanied
him
unto
the
ship.
021:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
after
we
were
gotten
from
them,
and
had
launched,
we
came
with
a
straight
course
unto
Coos,
and
the
day
following
unto
Rhodes,
and
from
thence
unto
Patara:
021:002
And
finding
a
ship
sailing
over
unto
Phenicia,
we
went
aboard,
and
set
forth.
021:003
Now
when
we
had
discovered
Cyprus,
we
left
it
on
the
left
hand,
and
sailed
into
Syria,
and
landed
at
Tyre:
for
there
the
ship
was
to
unlade
her
burden.
021:004
And
finding
disciples,
we
tarried
there
seven
days:
who
said
to
Paul
through
the
Spirit,
that
he
should
not
go
up
to
Jerusalem.
021:005
And
when
we
had
accomplished
those
days,
we
departed
and
went
our
way;
and
they
all
brought
us
on
our
way,
with
wives
and
children,
till
we
were
out
of
the
city:
and
we
kneeled
down
on
the
shore,
and
prayed.
021:006
And
when
we
had
taken
our
leave
one
of
another,
we
took
ship;
and
they
returned
home
again.
021:007
And
when
we
had
finished
our
course
from
Tyre,
we
came
to
Ptolemais,
and
saluted
the
brethren,
and
abode
with
them
one
day.
021:008
And
the
next
day
we
that
were
of
Paul's
company
departed,
and
came
unto
Caesarea:
and
we
entered
into
the
house
of
Philip
the
evangelist,
which
was
one
of
the
seven;
and
abode
with
him.
021:009
And
the
same
man
had
four
daughters,
virgins,
which
did
prophesy.
021:010
And
as
we
tarried
there
many
days,
there
came
down
from
Judaea
a
certain
prophet,
named
Agabus.
021:011
And
when
he
was
come
unto
us,
he
took
Paul's
girdle,
and
bound
his
own
hands
and
feet,
and
said,
Thus
saith
the
Holy
Ghost,
So
shall
the
Jews
at
Jerusalem
bind
the
man
that
owneth
this
girdle,
and
shall
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
the
Gentiles.
021:012
And
when
we
heard
these
things,
both
we,
and
they
of
that
place,
besought
him
not
to
go
up
to
Jerusalem.
021:013
Then
Paul
answered,
What
mean
ye
to
weep
and
to
break
mine
heart?
for
I
am
ready
not
to
be
bound
only,
but
also
to
die
at
Jerusalem
for
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus.
021:014
And
when
he
would
not
be
persuaded,
we
ceased,
saying,
The
will
of
the
Lord
be
done.
021:015
And
after
those
days
we
took
up
our
carriages,
and
went
up
to
Jerusalem.
021:016
There
went
with
us
also
certain
of
the
disciples
of
Caesarea,
and
brought
with
them
one
Mnason
of
Cyprus,
an
old
disciple,
with
whom
we
should
lodge.
021:017
And
when
we
were
come
to
Jerusalem,
the
brethren
received
us
gladly.
021:018
And
the
day
following
Paul
went
in
with
us
unto
James;
and
all
the
elders
were
present.
021:019
And
when
he
had
saluted
them,
he
declared
particularly
what
things
God
had
wrought
among
the
Gentiles
by
his
ministry.
021:020
And
when
they
heard
it,
they
glorified
the
Lord,
and
said
unto
him,
Thou
seest,
brother,
how
many
thousands
of
Jews
there
are
which
believe;
and
they
are
all
zealous
of
the
law:
021:021
And
they
are
informed
of
thee,
that
thou
teachest
all
the
Jews
which
are
among
the
Gentiles
to
forsake
Moses,
saying
that
they
ought
not
to
circumcise
their
children,
neither
to
walk
after
the
customs.
021:022
What
is
it
therefore?
the
multitude
must
needs
come
together:
for
they
will
hear
that
thou
art
come.
021:023
Do
therefore
this
that
we
say
to
thee:
We
have
four
men
which
have
a
vow
on
them;
021:024
Them
take,
and
purify
thyself
with
them,
and
be
at
charges
with
them,
that
they
may
shave
their
heads:
and
all
may
know
that
those
things,
whereof
they
were
informed
concerning
thee,
are
nothing;
but
that
thou
thyself
also
walkest
orderly,
and
keepest
the
law.
021:025
As
touching
the
Gentiles
which
believe,
we
have
written
and
concluded
that
they
observe
no
such
thing,
save
only
that
they
keep
themselves
from
things
offered
to
idols,
and
from
blood,
and
from
strangled,
and
from
fornication.
021:026
Then
Paul
took
the
men,
and
the
next
day
purifying
himself
with
them
entered
into
the
temple,
to
signify
the
accomplishment
of
the
days
of
purification,
until
that
an
offering
should
be
offered
for
every
one
of
them.
021:027
And
when
the
seven
days
were
almost
ended,
the
Jews
which
were
of
Asia,
when
they
saw
him
in
the
temple,
stirred
up
all
the
people,
and
laid
hands
on
him,
021:028
Crying
out,
Men
of
Israel,
help:
This
is
the
man,
that
teacheth
all
men
every
where
against
the
people,
and
the
law,
and
this
place:
and
further
brought
Greeks
also
into
the
temple,
and
hath
polluted
this
holy
place.
021:029
(For
they
had
seen
before
with
him
in
the
city
Trophimus
an
Ephesian,
whom
they
supposed
that
Paul
had
brought
into
the
temple.)
021:030
And
all
the
city
was
moved,
and
the
people
ran
together:
and
they
took
Paul,
and
drew
him
out
of
the
temple:
and
forthwith
the
doors
were
shut.
021:031
And
as
they
went
about
to
kill
him,
tidings
came
unto
the
chief
captain
of
the
band,
that
all
Jerusalem
was
in
an
uproar.
021:032
Who
immediately
took
soldiers
and
centurions,
and
ran
down
unto
them:
and
when
they
saw
the
chief
captain
and
the
soldiers,
they
left
beating
of
Paul.
021:033
Then
the
chief
captain
came
near,
and
took
him,
and
commanded
him
to
be
bound
with
two
chains;
and
demanded
who
he
was,
and
what
he
had
done.
021:034
And
some
cried
one
thing,
some
another,
among
the
multitude:
and
when
he
could
not
know
the
certainty
for
the
tumult,
he
commanded
him
to
be
carried
into
the
castle.
021:035
And
when
he
came
upon
the
stairs,
so
it
was,
that
he
was
borne
of
the
soldiers
for
the
violence
of
the
people.
021:036
For
the
multitude
of
the
people
followed
after,
crying,
Away
with
him.
021:037
And
as
Paul
was
to
be
led
into
the
castle,
he
said
unto
the
chief
captain,
May
I
speak
unto
thee?
Who
said,
Canst
thou
speak
Greek?
021:038
Art
not
thou
that
Egyptian,
which
before
these
days
madest
an
uproar,
and
leddest
out
into
the
wilderness
four
thousand
men
that
were
murderers?
021:039
But
Paul
said,
I
am
a
man
which
am
a
Jew
of
Tarsus,
a
city
in
Cilicia,
a
citizen
of
no
mean
city:
and,
I
beseech
thee,
suffer
me
to
speak
unto
the
people.
021:040
And
when
he
had
given
him
licence,
Paul
stood
on
the
stairs,
and
beckoned
with
the
hand
unto
the
people.
And
when
there
was
made
a
great
silence,
he
spake
unto
them
in
the
Hebrew
tongue,
saying,
022:001
Men,
brethren,
and
fathers,
hear
ye
my
defence
which
I
make
now
unto
you.
022:002
(And
when
they
heard
that
he
spake
in
the
Hebrew
tongue
to
them,
they
kept
the
more
silence:
and
he
saith,)
022:003
I
am
verily
a
man
which
am
a
Jew,
born
in
Tarsus,
a
city
in
Cilicia,
yet
brought
up
in
this
city
at
the
feet
of
Gamaliel,
and
taught
according
to
the
perfect
manner
of
the
law
of
the
fathers,
and
was
zealous
toward
God,
as
ye
all
are
this
day.
022:004
And
I
persecuted
this
way
unto
the
death,
binding
and
delivering
into
prisons
both
men
and
women.
022:005
As
also
the
high
priest
doth
bear
me
witness,
and
all
the
estate
of
the
elders:
from
whom
also
I
received
letters
unto
the
brethren,
and
went
to
Damascus,
to
bring
them
which
were
there
bound
unto
Jerusalem,
for
to
be
punished.
022:006
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
as
I
made
my
journey,
and
was
come
nigh
unto
Damascus
about
noon,
suddenly
there
shone
from
heaven
a
great
light
round
about
me.
022:007
And
I
fell
unto
the
ground,
and
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
me,
Saul,
Saul,
why
persecutest
thou
me?
022:008
And
I
answered,
Who
art
thou,
Lord?
And
he
said
unto
me,
I
am
Jesus
of
Nazareth,
whom
thou
persecutest.
022:009
And
they
that
were
with
me
saw
indeed
the
light,
and
were
afraid;
but
they
heard
not
the
voice
of
him
that
spake
to
me.
022:010
And
I
said,
What
shall
I
do,
LORD?
And
the
Lord
said
unto
me,
Arise,
and
go
into
Damascus;
and
there
it
shall
be
told
thee
of
all
things
which
are
appointed
for
thee
to
do.
022:011
And
when
I
could
not
see
for
the
glory
of
that
light,
being
led
by
the
hand
of
them
that
were
with
me,
I
came
into
Damascus.
022:012
And
one
Ananias,
a
devout
man
according
to
the
law,
having
a
good
report
of
all
the
Jews
which
dwelt
there,
022:013
Came
unto
me,
and
stood,
and
said
unto
me,
Brother
Saul,
receive
thy
sight.
And
the
same
hour
I
looked
up
upon
him.
022:014
And
he
said,
The
God
of
our
fathers
hath
chosen
thee,
that
thou
shouldest
know
his
will,
and
see
that
Just
One,
and
shouldest
hear
the
voice
of
his
mouth.
022:015
For
thou
shalt
be
his
witness
unto
all
men
of
what
thou
hast
seen
and
heard.
022:016
And
now
why
tarriest
thou?
arise,
and
be
baptized,
and
wash
away
thy
sins,
calling
on
the
name
of
the
Lord.
022:017
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
I
was
come
again
to
Jerusalem,
even
while
I
prayed
in
the
temple,
I
was
in
a
trance;
022:018
And
saw
him
saying
unto
me,
Make
haste,
and
get
thee
quickly
out
of
Jerusalem:
for
they
will
not
receive
thy
testimony
concerning
me.
022:019
And
I
said,
Lord,
they
know
that
I
imprisoned
and
beat
in
every
synagogue
them
that
believed
on
thee:
022:020
And
when
the
blood
of
thy
martyr
Stephen
was
shed,
I
also
was
standing
by,
and
consenting
unto
his
death,
and
kept
the
raiment
of
them
that
slew
him.
022:021
And
he
said
unto
me,
Depart:
for
I
will
send
thee
far
hence
unto
the
Gentiles.
022:022
And
they
gave
him
audience
unto
this
word,
and
then
lifted
up
their
voices,
and
said,
Away
with
such
a
fellow
from
the
earth:
for
it
is
not
fit
that
he
should
live.
022:023
And
as
they
cried
out,
and
cast
off
their
clothes,
and
threw
dust
into
the
air,
022:024
The
chief
captain
commanded
him
to
be
brought
into
the
castle,
and
bade
that
he
should
be
examined
by
scourging;
that
he
might
know
wherefore
they
cried
so
against
him.
022:025
And
as
they
bound
him
with
thongs,
Paul
said
unto
the
centurion
that
stood
by,
Is
it
lawful
for
you
to
scourge
a
man
that
is
a
Roman,
and
uncondemned?
022:026
When
the
centurion
heard
that,
he
went
and
told
the
chief
captain,
saying,
Take
heed
what
thou
doest:
for
this
man
is
a
Roman.
022:027
Then
the
chief
captain
came,
and
said
unto
him,
Tell
me,
art
thou
a
Roman?
He
said,
Yea.
022:028
And
the
chief
captain
answered,
With
a
great
sum
obtained
I
this
freedom.
And
Paul
said,
But
I
was
free
born.
022:029
Then
straightway
they
departed
from
him
which
should
have
examined
him:
and
the
chief
captain
also
was
afraid,
after
he
knew
that
he
was
a
Roman,
and
because
he
had
bound
him.
022:030
On
the
morrow,
because
he
would
have
known
the
certainty
wherefore
he
was
accused
of
the
Jews,
he
loosed
him
from
his
bands,
and
commanded
the
chief
priests
and
all
their
council
to
appear,
and
brought
Paul
down,
and
set
him
before
them.
023:001
And
Paul,
earnestly
beholding
the
council,
said,
Men
and
brethren,
I
have
lived
in
all
good
conscience
before
God
until
this
day.
023:002
And
the
high
priest
Ananias
commanded
them
that
stood
by
him
to
smite
him
on
the
mouth.
023:003
Then
said
Paul
unto
him,
God
shall
smite
thee,
thou
whited
wall:
for
sittest
thou
to
judge
me
after
the
law,
and
commandest
me
to
be
smitten
contrary
to
the
law?
023:004
And
they
that
stood
by
said,
Revilest
thou
God's
high
priest?
023:005
Then
said
Paul,
I
wist
not,
brethren,
that
he
was
the
high
priest:
for
it
is
written,
Thou
shalt
not
speak
evil
of
the
ruler
of
thy
people.
023:006
But
when
Paul
perceived
that
the
one
part
were
Sadducees,
and
the
other
Pharisees,
he
cried
out
in
the
council,
Men
and
brethren,
I
am
a
Pharisee,
the
son
of
a
Pharisee:
of
the
hope
and
resurrection
of
the
dead
I
am
called
in
question.
023:007
And
when
he
had
so
said,
there
arose
a
dissension
between
the
Pharisees
and
the
Sadducees:
and
the
multitude
was
divided.
023:008
For
the
Sadducees
say
that
there
is
no
resurrection,
neither
angel,
nor
spirit:
but
the
Pharisees
confess
both.
023:009
And
there
arose
a
great
cry:
and
the
scribes
that
were
of
the
Pharisees'
part
arose,
and
strove,
saying,
We
find
no
evil
in
this
man:
but
if
a
spirit
or
an
angel
hath
spoken
to
him,
let
us
not
fight
against
God.
023:010
And
when
there
arose
a
great
dissension,
the
chief
captain,
fearing
lest
Paul
should
have
been
pulled
in
pieces
of
them,
commanded
the
soldiers
to
go
down,
and
to
take
him
by
force
from
among
them,
and
to
bring
him
into
the
castle.
023:011
And
the
night
following
the
Lord
stood
by
him,
and
said,
Be
of
good
cheer,
Paul:
for
as
thou
hast
testified
of
me
in
Jerusalem,
so
must
thou
bear
witness
also
at
Rome.
023:012
And
when
it
was
day,
certain
of
the
Jews
banded
together,
and
bound
themselves
under
a
curse,
saying
that
they
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
had
killed
Paul.
023:013
And
they
were
more
than
forty
which
had
made
this
conspiracy.
023:014
And
they
came
to
the
chief
priests
and
elders,
and
said,
We
have
bound
ourselves
under
a
great
curse,
that
we
will
eat
nothing
until
we
have
slain
Paul.
023:015
Now
therefore
ye
with
the
council
signify
to
the
chief
captain
that
he
bring
him
down
unto
you
to
morrow,
as
though
ye
would
enquire
something
more
perfectly
concerning
him:
and
we,
or
ever
he
come
near,
are
ready
to
kill
him.
023:016
And
when
Paul's
sister's
son
heard
of
their
lying
in
wait,
he
went
and
entered
into
the
castle,
and
told
Paul.
023:017
Then
Paul
called
one
of
the
centurions
unto
him,
and
said,
Bring
this
young
man
unto
the
chief
captain:
for
he
hath
a
certain
thing
to
tell
him.
023:018
So
he
took
him,
and
brought
him
to
the
chief
captain,
and
said,
Paul
the
prisoner
called
me
unto
him,
and
prayed
me
to
bring
this
young
man
unto
thee,
who
hath
something
to
say
unto
thee.
023:019
Then
the
chief
captain
took
him
by
the
hand,
and
went
with
him
aside
privately,
and
asked
him,
What
is
that
thou
hast
to
tell
me?
023:020
And
he
said,
The
Jews
have
agreed
to
desire
thee
that
thou
wouldest
bring
down
Paul
to
morrow
into
the
council,
as
though
they
would
enquire
somewhat
of
him
more
perfectly.
023:021
But
do
not
thou
yield
unto
them:
for
there
lie
in
wait
for
him
of
them
more
than
forty
men,
which
have
bound
themselves
with
an
oath,
that
they
will
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
have
killed
him:
and
now
are
they
ready,
looking
for
a
promise
from
thee.
023:022
So
the
chief
captain
then
let
the
young
man
depart,
and
charged
him,
See
thou
tell
no
man
that
thou
hast
shewed
these
things
to
me.
023:023
And
he
called
unto
him
two
centurions,
saying,
Make
ready
two
hundred
soldiers
to
go
to
Caesarea,
and
horsemen
threescore
and
ten,
and
spearmen
two
hundred,
at
the
third
hour
of
the
night;
023:024
And
provide
them
beasts,
that
they
may
set
Paul
on,
and
bring
him
safe
unto
Felix
the
governor.
023:025
And
he
wrote
a
letter
after
this
manner:
023:026
Claudius
Lysias
unto
the
most
excellent
governor
Felix
sendeth
greeting.
023:027
This
man
was
taken
of
the
Jews,
and
should
have
been
killed
of
them:
then
came
I
with
an
army,
and
rescued
him,
having
understood
that
he
was
a
Roman.
023:028
And
when
I
would
have
known
the
cause
wherefore
they
accused
him,
I
brought
him
forth
into
their
council:
023:029
Whom
I
perceived
to
be
accused
of
questions
of
their
law,
but
to
have
nothing
laid
to
his
charge
worthy
of
death
or
of
bonds.
023:030
And
when
it
was
told
me
how
that
the
Jews
laid
wait
for
the
man,
I
sent
straightway
to
thee,
and
gave
commandment
to
his
accusers
also
to
say
before
thee
what
they
had
against
him.
Farewell.
023:031
Then
the
soldiers,
as
it
was
commanded
them,
took
Paul,
and
brought
him
by
night
to
Antipatris.
023:032
