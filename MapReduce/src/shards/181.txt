On
the
morrow
they
left
the
horsemen
to
go
with
him,
and
returned
to
the
castle:
023:033
Who,
when
they
came
to
Caesarea
and
delivered
the
epistle
to
the
governor,
presented
Paul
also
before
him.
023:034
And
when
the
governor
had
read
the
letter,
he
asked
of
what
province
he
was.
And
when
he
understood
that
he
was
of
Cilicia;
023:035
I
will
hear
thee,
said
he,
when
thine
accusers
are
also
come.
And
he
commanded
him
to
be
kept
in
Herod's
judgment
hall.
024:001
And
after
five
days
Ananias
the
high
priest
descended
with
the
elders,
and
with
a
certain
orator
named
Tertullus,
who
informed
the
governor
against
Paul.
024:002
And
when
he
was
called
forth,
Tertullus
began
to
accuse
him,
saying,
Seeing
that
by
thee
we
enjoy
great
quietness,
and
that
very
worthy
deeds
are
done
unto
this
nation
by
thy
providence,
024:003
We
accept
it
always,
and
in
all
places,
most
noble
Felix,
with
all
thankfulness.
024:004
Notwithstanding,
that
I
be
not
further
tedious
unto
thee,
I
pray
thee
that
thou
wouldest
hear
us
of
thy
clemency
a
few
words.
024:005
For
we
have
found
this
man
a
pestilent
fellow,
and
a
mover
of
sedition
among
all
the
Jews
throughout
the
world,
and
a
ringleader
of
the
sect
of
the
Nazarenes:
024:006
Who
also
hath
gone
about
to
profane
the
temple:
whom
we
took,
and
would
have
judged
according
to
our
law.
024:007
But
the
chief
captain
Lysias
came
upon
us,
and
with
great
violence
took
him
away
out
of
our
hands,
024:008
Commanding
his
accusers
to
come
unto
thee:
by
examining
of
whom
thyself
mayest
take
knowledge
of
all
these
things,
whereof
we
accuse
him.
024:009
And
the
Jews
also
assented,
saying
that
these
things
were
so.
024:010
Then
Paul,
after
that
the
governor
had
beckoned
unto
him
to
speak,
answered,
Forasmuch
as
I
know
that
thou
hast
been
of
many
years
a
judge
unto
this
nation,
I
do
the
more
cheerfully
answer
for
myself:
024:011
Because
that
thou
mayest
understand,
that
there
are
yet
but
twelve
days
since
I
went
up
to
Jerusalem
for
to
worship.
024:012
And
they
neither
found
me
in
the
temple
disputing
with
any
man,
neither
raising
up
the
people,
neither
in
the
synagogues,
nor
in
the
city:
024:013
Neither
can
they
prove
the
things
whereof
they
now
accuse
me.
024:014
But
this
I
confess
unto
thee,
that
after
the
way
which
they
call
heresy,
so
worship
I
the
God
of
my
fathers,
believing
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
law
and
in
the
prophets:
024:015
And
have
hope
toward
God,
which
they
themselves
also
allow,
that
there
shall
be
a
resurrection
of
the
dead,
both
of
the
just
and
unjust.
024:016
And
herein
do
I
exercise
myself,
to
have
always
a
conscience
void
to
offence
toward
God,
and
toward
men.
024:017
Now
after
many
years
I
came
to
bring
alms
to
my
nation,
and
offerings.
024:018
Whereupon
certain
Jews
from
Asia
found
me
purified
in
the
temple,
neither
with
multitude,
nor
with
tumult.
024:019
Who
ought
to
have
been
here
before
thee,
and
object,
if
they
had
ought
against
me.
024:020
Or
else
let
these
same
here
say,
if
they
have
found
any
evil
doing
in
me,
while
I
stood
before
the
council,
024:021
Except
it
be
for
this
one
voice,
that
I
cried
standing
among
them,
Touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
I
am
called
in
question
by
you
this
day.
024:022
And
when
Felix
heard
these
things,
having
more
perfect
knowledge
of
that
way,
he
deferred
them,
and
said,
When
Lysias
the
chief
captain
shall
come
down,
I
will
know
the
uttermost
of
your
matter.
024:023
And
he
commanded
a
centurion
to
keep
Paul,
and
to
let
him
have
liberty,
and
that
he
should
forbid
none
of
his
acquaintance
to
minister
or
come
unto
him.
024:024
And
after
certain
days,
when
Felix
came
with
his
wife
Drusilla,
which
was
a
Jewess,
he
sent
for
Paul,
and
heard
him
concerning
the
faith
in
Christ.
024:025
And
as
he
reasoned
of
righteousness,
temperance,
and
judgment
to
come,
Felix
trembled,
and
answered,
Go
thy
way
for
this
time;
when
I
have
a
convenient
season,
I
will
call
for
thee.
024:026
He
hoped
also
that
money
should
have
been
given
him
of
Paul,
that
he
might
loose
him:
wherefore
he
sent
for
him
the
oftener,
and
communed
with
him.
024:027
But
after
two
years
Porcius
Festus
came
into
Felix'
room:
and
Felix,
willing
to
shew
the
Jews
a
pleasure,
left
Paul
bound.
025:001
Now
when
Festus
was
come
into
the
province,
after
three
days
he
ascended
from
Caesarea
to
Jerusalem.
025:002
Then
the
high
priest
and
the
chief
of
the
Jews
informed
him
against
Paul,
and
besought
him,
025:003
And
desired
favour
against
him,
that
he
would
send
for
him
to
Jerusalem,
laying
wait
in
the
way
to
kill
him.
025:004
But
Festus
answered,
that
Paul
should
be
kept
at
Caesarea,
and
that
he
himself
would
depart
shortly
thither.
025:005
Let
them
therefore,
said
he,
which
among
you
are
able,
go
down
with
me,
and
accuse
this
man,
if
there
be
any
wickedness
in
him.
025:006
And
when
he
had
tarried
among
them
more
than
ten
days,
he
went
down
unto
Caesarea;
and
the
next
day
sitting
on
the
judgment
seat
commanded
Paul
to
be
brought.
025:007
And
when
he
was
come,
the
Jews
which
came
down
from
Jerusalem
stood
round
about,
and
laid
many
and
grievous
complaints
against
Paul,
which
they
could
not
prove.
025:008
While
he
answered
for
himself,
Neither
against
the
law
of
the
Jews,
neither
against
the
temple,
nor
yet
against
Caesar,
have
I
offended
any
thing
at
all.
025:009
But
Festus,
willing
to
do
the
Jews
a
pleasure,
answered
Paul,
and
said,
Wilt
thou
go
up
to
Jerusalem,
and
there
be
judged
of
these
things
before
me?
025:010
Then
said
Paul,
I
stand
at
Caesar's
judgment
seat,
where
I
ought
to
be
judged:
to
the
Jews
have
I
done
no
wrong,
as
thou
very
well
knowest.
025:011
For
if
I
be
an
offender,
or
have
committed
any
thing
worthy
of
death,
I
refuse
not
to
die:
but
if
there
be
none
of
these
things
whereof
these
accuse
me,
no
man
may
deliver
me
unto
them.
I
appeal
unto
Caesar.
025:012
Then
Festus,
when
he
had
conferred
with
the
council,
answered,
Hast
thou
appealed
unto
Caesar?
unto
Caesar
shalt
thou
go.
025:013
And
after
certain
days
king
Agrippa
and
Bernice
came
unto
Caesarea
to
salute
Festus.
025:014
And
when
they
had
been
there
many
days,
Festus
declared
Paul's
cause
unto
the
king,
saying,
There
is
a
certain
man
left
in
bonds
by
Felix:
025:015
About
whom,
when
I
was
at
Jerusalem,
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
Jews
informed
me,
desiring
to
have
judgment
against
him.
025:016
To
whom
I
answered,
It
is
not
the
manner
of
the
Romans
to
deliver
any
man
to
die,
before
that
he
which
is
accused
have
the
accusers
face
to
face,
and
have
licence
to
answer
for
himself
concerning
the
crime
laid
against
him.
025:017
Therefore,
when
they
were
come
hither,
without
any
delay
on
the
morrow
I
sat
on
the
judgment
seat,
and
commanded
the
man
to
be
brought
forth.
025:018
Against
whom
when
the
accusers
stood
up,
they
brought
none
accusation
of
such
things
as
I
supposed:
025:019
But
had
certain
questions
against
him
of
their
own
superstition,
and
of
one
Jesus,
which
was
dead,
whom
Paul
affirmed
to
be
alive.
025:020
And
because
I
doubted
of
such
manner
of
questions,
I
asked
him
whether
he
would
go
to
Jerusalem,
and
there
be
judged
of
these
matters.
025:021
But
when
Paul
had
appealed
to
be
reserved
unto
the
hearing
of
Augustus,
I
commanded
him
to
be
kept
till
I
might
send
him
to
Caesar.
025:022
Then
Agrippa
said
unto
Festus,
I
would
also
hear
the
man
myself.
To
morrow,
said
he,
thou
shalt
hear
him.
025:023
And
on
the
morrow,
when
Agrippa
was
come,
and
Bernice,
with
great
pomp,
and
was
entered
into
the
place
of
hearing,
with
the
chief
captains,
and
principal
men
of
the
city,
at
Festus'
commandment
Paul
was
brought
forth.
025:024
And
Festus
said,
King
Agrippa,
and
all
men
which
are
here
present
with
us,
ye
see
this
man,
about
whom
all
the
multitude
of
the
Jews
have
dealt
with
me,
both
at
Jerusalem,
and
also
here,
crying
that
he
ought
not
to
live
any
longer.
025:025
But
when
I
found
that
he
had
committed
nothing
worthy
of
death,
and
that
he
himself
hath
appealed
to
Augustus,
I
have
determined
to
send
him.
025:026
Of
whom
I
have
no
certain
thing
to
write
unto
my
lord.
Wherefore
I
have
brought
him
forth
before
you,
and
specially
before
thee,
O
king
Agrippa,
that,
after
examination
had,
I
might
have
somewhat
to
write.
025:027
For
it
seemeth
to
me
unreasonable
to
send
a
prisoner,
and
not
withal
to
signify
the
crimes
laid
against
him.
026:001
Then
Agrippa
said
unto
Paul,
Thou
art
permitted
to
speak
for
thyself.
Then
Paul
stretched
forth
the
hand,
and
answered
for
himself:
026:002
I
think
myself
happy,
king
Agrippa,
because
I
shall
answer
for
myself
this
day
before
thee
touching
all
the
things
whereof
I
am
accused
of
the
Jews:
026:003
Especially
because
I
know
thee
to
be
expert
in
all
customs
and
questions
which
are
among
the
Jews:
wherefore
I
beseech
thee
to
hear
me
patiently.
026:004
My
manner
of
life
from
my
youth,
which
was
at
the
first
among
mine
own
nation
at
Jerusalem,
know
all
the
Jews;
026:005
Which
knew
me
from
the
beginning,
if
they
would
testify,
that
after
the
most
straitest
sect
of
our
religion
I
lived
a
Pharisee.
026:006
And
now
I
stand
and
am
judged
for
the
hope
of
the
promise
made
of
God,
unto
our
fathers:
026:007
Unto
which
promise
our
twelve
tribes,
instantly
serving
God
day
and
night,
hope
to
come.
For
which
hope's
sake,
king
Agrippa,
I
am
accused
of
the
Jews.
026:008
Why
should
it
be
thought
a
thing
incredible
with
you,
that
God
should
raise
the
dead?
026:009
I
verily
thought
with
myself,
that
I
ought
to
do
many
things
contrary
to
the
name
of
Jesus
of
Nazareth.
026:010
Which
thing
I
also
did
in
Jerusalem:
and
many
of
the
saints
did
I
shut
up
in
prison,
having
received
authority
from
the
chief
priests;
and
when
they
were
put
to
death,
I
gave
my
voice
against
them.
026:011
And
I
punished
them
oft
in
every
synagogue,
and
compelled
them
to
blaspheme;
and
being
exceedingly
mad
against
them,
I
persecuted
them
even
unto
strange
cities.
026:012
Whereupon
as
I
went
to
Damascus
with
authority
and
commission
from
the
chief
priests,
026:013
At
midday,
O
king,
I
saw
in
the
way
a
light
from
heaven,
above
the
brightness
of
the
sun,
shining
round
about
me
and
them
which
journeyed
with
me.
026:014
And
when
we
were
all
fallen
to
the
earth,
I
heard
a
voice
speaking
unto
me,
and
saying
in
the
Hebrew
tongue,
Saul,
Saul,
why
persecutest
thou
me?
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks.
026:015
And
I
said,
Who
art
thou,
Lord?
And
he
said,
I
am
Jesus
whom
thou
persecutest.
026:016
But
rise,
and
stand
upon
thy
feet:
for
I
have
appeared
unto
thee
for
this
purpose,
to
make
thee
a
minister
and
a
witness
both
of
these
things
which
thou
hast
seen,
and
of
those
things
in
the
which
I
will
appear
unto
thee;
026:017
Delivering
thee
from
the
people,
and
from
the
Gentiles,
unto
whom
now
I
send
thee,
026:018
To
open
their
eyes,
and
to
turn
them
from
darkness
to
light,
and
from
the
power
of
Satan
unto
God,
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
sins,
and
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
by
faith
that
is
in
me.
026:019
Whereupon,
O
king
Agrippa,
I
was
not
disobedient
unto
the
heavenly
vision:
026:020
But
shewed
first
unto
them
of
Damascus,
and
at
Jerusalem,
and
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
Judaea,
and
then
to
the
Gentiles,
that
they
should
repent
and
turn
to
God,
and
do
works
meet
for
repentance.
026:021
For
these
causes
the
Jews
caught
me
in
the
temple,
and
went
about
to
kill
me.
026:022
Having
therefore
obtained
help
of
God,
I
continue
unto
this
day,
witnessing
both
to
small
and
great,
saying
none
other
things
than
those
which
the
prophets
and
Moses
did
say
should
come:
026:023
That
Christ
should
suffer,
and
that
he
should
be
the
first
that
should
rise
from
the
dead,
and
should
shew
light
unto
the
people,
and
to
the
Gentiles.
026:024
And
as
he
thus
spake
for
himself,
Festus
said
with
a
loud
voice,
Paul,
thou
art
beside
thyself;
much
learning
doth
make
thee
mad.
026:025
But
he
said,
I
am
not
mad,
most
noble
Festus;
but
speak
forth
the
words
of
truth
and
soberness.
026:026
For
the
king
knoweth
of
these
things,
before
whom
also
I
speak
freely:
for
I
am
persuaded
that
none
of
these
things
are
hidden
from
him;
for
this
thing
was
not
done
in
a
corner.
026:027
King
Agrippa,
believest
thou
the
prophets?
I
know
that
thou
believest.
026:028
Then
Agrippa
said
unto
Paul,
Almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
Christian.
026:029
And
Paul
said,
I
would
to
God,
that
not
only
thou,
but
also
all
that
hear
me
this
day,
were
both
almost,
and
altogether
such
as
I
am,
except
these
bonds.
026:030
And
when
he
had
thus
spoken,
the
king
rose
up,
and
the
governor,
and
Bernice,
and
they
that
sat
with
them:
026:031
And
when
they
were
gone
aside,
they
talked
between
themselves,
saying,
This
man
doeth
nothing
worthy
of
death
or
of
bonds.
026:032
Then
said
Agrippa
unto
Festus,
This
man
might
have
been
set
at
liberty,
if
he
had
not
appealed
unto
Caesar.
027:001
And
when
it
was
determined
that
we
should
sail
into
Italy,
they
delivered
Paul
and
certain
other
prisoners
unto
one
named
Julius,
a
centurion
of
Augustus'
band.
027:002
And
entering
into
a
ship
of
Adramyttium,
we
launched,
meaning
to
sail
by
the
coasts
of
Asia;
one
Aristarchus,
a
Macedonian
of
Thessalonica,
being
with
us.
027:003
And
the
next
day
we
touched
at
Sidon.
And
Julius
courteously
entreated
Paul,
and
gave
him
liberty
to
go
unto
his
friends
to
refresh
himself.
027:004
And
when
we
had
launched
from
thence,
we
sailed
under
Cyprus,
because
the
winds
were
contrary.
027:005
And
when
we
had
sailed
over
the
sea
of
Cilicia
and
Pamphylia,
we
came
to
Myra,
a
city
of
Lycia.
027:006
And
there
the
centurion
found
a
ship
of
Alexandria
sailing
into
Italy;
and
he
put
us
therein.
027:007
And
when
we
had
sailed
slowly
many
days,
and
scarce
were
come
over
against
Cnidus,
the
wind
not
suffering
us,
we
sailed
under
Crete,
over
against
Salmone;
027:008
And,
hardly
passing
it,
came
unto
a
place
which
is
called
The
fair
havens;
nigh
whereunto
was
the
city
of
Lasea.
027:009
Now
when
much
time
was
spent,
and
when
sailing
was
now
dangerous,
because
the
fast
was
now
already
past,
Paul
admonished
them,
027:010
And
said
unto
them,
Sirs,
I
perceive
that
this
voyage
will
be
with
hurt
and
much
damage,
not
only
of
the
lading
and
ship,
but
also
of
our
lives.
027:011
Nevertheless
the
centurion
believed
the
master
and
the
owner
of
the
ship,
more
than
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
Paul.
027:012
And
because
the
haven
was
not
commodious
to
winter
in,
the
more
part
advised
to
depart
thence
also,
if
by
any
means
they
might
attain
to
Phenice,
and
there
to
winter;
which
is
an
haven
of
Crete,
and
lieth
toward
the
south
west
and
north
west.
027:013
And
when
the
south
wind
blew
softly,
supposing
that
they
had
obtained
their
purpose,
loosing
thence,
they
sailed
close
by
Crete.
027:014
But
not
long
after
there
arose
against
it
a
tempestuous
wind,
called
Euroclydon.
027:015
And
when
the
ship
was
caught,
and
could
not
bear
up
into
the
wind,
we
let
her
drive.
027:016
And
running
under
a
certain
island
which
is
called
Clauda,
we
had
much
work
to
come
by
the
boat:
027:017
Which
when
they
had
taken
up,
they
used
helps,
undergirding
the
ship;
and,
fearing
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
quicksands,
strake
sail,
and
so
were
driven.
027:018
And
we
being
exceedingly
tossed
with
a
tempest,
the
next
day
they
lightened
the
ship;
027:019
And
the
third
day
we
cast
out
with
our
own
hands
the
tackling
of
the
ship.
027:020
And
when
neither
sun
nor
stars
in
many
days
appeared,
and
no
small
tempest
lay
on
us,
all
hope
that
we
should
be
saved
was
then
taken
away.
027:021
But
after
long
abstinence
Paul
stood
forth
in
the
midst
of
them,
and
said,
Sirs,
ye
should
have
hearkened
unto
me,
and
not
have
loosed
from
Crete,
and
to
have
gained
this
harm
and
loss.
027:022
And
now
I
exhort
you
to
be
of
good
cheer:
for
there
shall
be
no
loss
of
any
man's
life
among
you,
but
of
the
ship.
027:023
For
there
stood
by
me
this
night
the
angel
of
God,
whose
I
am,
and
whom
I
serve,
027:024
Saying,
Fear
not,
Paul;
thou
must
be
brought
before
Caesar:
and,
lo,
God
hath
given
thee
all
them
that
sail
with
thee.
027:025
Wherefore,
sirs,
be
of
good
cheer:
for
I
believe
God,
that
it
shall
be
even
as
it
was
told
me.
027:026
Howbeit
we
must
be
cast
upon
a
certain
island.
027:027
But
when
the
fourteenth
night
was
come,
as
we
were
driven
up
and
down
in
Adria,
about
midnight
the
shipmen
deemed
that
they
drew
near
to
some
country;
027:028
And
sounded,
and
found
it
twenty
fathoms:
and
when
they
had
gone
a
little
further,
they
sounded
again,
and
found
it
fifteen
fathoms.
027:029
Then
fearing
lest
we
should
have
fallen
upon
rocks,
they
cast
four
anchors
out
of
the
stern,
and
wished
for
the
day.
027:030
And
as
the
shipmen
were
about
to
flee
out
of
the
ship,
when
they
had
let
down
the
boat
into
the
sea,
under
colour
as
though
they
would
have
cast
anchors
out
of
the
foreship,
027:031
Paul
said
to
the
centurion
and
to
the
soldiers,
Except
these
abide
in
the
ship,
ye
cannot
be
saved.
027:032
Then
the
soldiers
cut
off
the
ropes
of
the
boat,
and
let
her
fall
off.
027:033
And
while
the
day
was
coming
on,
Paul
besought
them
all
to
take
meat,
saying,
This
day
is
the
fourteenth
day
that
ye
have
tarried
and
continued
fasting,
having
taken
nothing.
027:034
Wherefore
I
pray
you
to
take
some
meat:
for
this
is
for
your
health:
for
there
shall
not
an
hair
fall
from
the
head
of
any
of
you.
027:035
And
when
he
had
thus
spoken,
he
took
bread,
and
gave
thanks
to
God
in
presence
of
them
all:
and
when
he
had
broken
it,
he
began
to
eat.
027:036
Then
were
they
all
of
good
cheer,
and
they
also
took
some
meat.
027:037
And
we
were
in
all
in
the
ship
two
hundred
threescore
and
sixteen
souls.
027:038
And
when
they
had
eaten
enough,
they
lightened
the
ship,
and
cast
out
the
wheat
into
the
sea.
027:039
And
when
it
was
day,
they
knew
not
the
land:
but
they
discovered
a
certain
creek
with
a
shore,
into
the
which
they
were
minded,
if
it
were
possible,
to
thrust
in
the
ship.
027:040
And
when
they
had
taken
up
the
anchors,
they
committed
themselves
unto
the
sea,
and
loosed
the
rudder
bands,
and
hoised
up
the
mainsail
to
the
wind,
and
made
toward
shore.
027:041
And
falling
into
a
place
where
two
seas
met,
they
ran
the
ship
aground;
and
the
forepart
stuck
fast,
and
remained
unmoveable,
but
the
hinder
part
was
broken
with
the
violence
of
the
waves.
027:042
And
the
soldiers'
counsel
was
to
kill
the
prisoners,
lest
any
of
them
should
swim
out,
and
escape.
027:043
But
the
centurion,
willing
to
save
Paul,
kept
them
from
their
purpose;
and
commanded
that
they
which
could
swim
should
cast
themselves
first
into
the
sea,
and
get
to
land:
027:044
And
the
rest,
some
on
boards,
and
some
on
broken
pieces
of
the
ship.
And
so
it
came
to
pass,
that
they
escaped
all
safe
to
land.
028:001
And
when
they
were
escaped,
then
they
knew
that
the
island
was
called
Melita.
028:002
And
the
barbarous
people
shewed
us
no
little
kindness:
for
they
kindled
a
fire,
and
received
us
every
one,
because
of
the
present
rain,
and
because
of
the
cold.
028:003
And
when
Paul
had
gathered
a
bundle
of
sticks,
and
laid
them
on
the
fire,
there
came
a
viper
out
of
the
heat,
and
fastened
on
his
hand.
028:004
And
when
the
barbarians
saw
the
venomous
beast
hang
on
his
hand,
they
said
among
themselves,
No
doubt
this
man
is
a
murderer,
whom,
though
he
hath
escaped
the
sea,
yet
vengeance
suffereth
not
to
live.
028:005
And
he
shook
off
the
beast
into
the
fire,
and
felt
no
harm.
028:006
Howbeit
they
looked
when
he
should
have
swollen,
or
fallen
down
dead
suddenly:
but
after
they
had
looked
a
great
while,
and
saw
no
harm
come
to
him,
they
changed
their
minds,
and
said
that
he
was
a
god.
028:007
In
the
same
quarters
were
possessions
of
the
chief
man
of
the
island,
whose
name
was
Publius;
who
received
us,
and
lodged
us
three
days
courteously.
028:008
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
the
father
of
Publius
lay
sick
of
a
fever
and
of
a
bloody
flux:
to
whom
Paul
entered
in,
and
prayed,
and
laid
his
hands
on
him,
and
healed
him.
028:009
So
when
this
was
done,
others
also,
which
had
diseases
in
the
island,
came,
and
were
healed:
028:010
Who
also
honoured
us
with
many
honours;
and
when
we
departed,
they
laded
us
with
such
things
as
were
necessary.
028:011
And
after
three
months
we
departed
in
a
ship
of
Alexandria,
which
had
wintered
in
the
isle,
whose
sign
was
Castor
and
Pollux.
028:012
And
landing
at
Syracuse,
we
tarried
there
three
days.
028:013
And
from
thence
we
fetched
a
compass,
and
came
to
Rhegium:
and
after
one
day
the
south
wind
blew,
and
we
came
the
next
day
to
Puteoli:
028:014
Where
we
found
brethren,
and
were
desired
to
tarry
with
them
seven
days:
and
so
we
went
toward
Rome.
028:015
And
from
thence,
when
the
brethren
heard
of
us,
they
came
to
meet
us
as
far
as
Appii
forum,
and
The
three
taverns:
whom
when
Paul
saw,
he
thanked
God,
and
took
courage.
028:016
And
when
we
came
to
Rome,
the
centurion
delivered
the
prisoners
to
the
captain
of
the
guard:
but
Paul
was
suffered
to
dwell
by
himself
with
a
soldier
that
kept
him.
028:017
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
after
three
days
Paul
called
the
chief
of
the
Jews
together:
and
when
they
were
come
together,
he
said
unto
them,
Men
and
brethren,
though
I
have
committed
nothing
against
the
people,
or
customs
of
our
fathers,
yet
was
I
delivered
prisoner
from
Jerusalem
into
the
hands
of
the
Romans.
028:018
Who,
when
they
had
examined
me,
would
have
let
me
go,
because
there
was
no
cause
of
death
in
me.
028:019
But
when
the
Jews
spake
against
it,
I
was
constrained
to
appeal
unto
Caesar;
not
that
I
had
ought
to
accuse
my
nation
of.
028:020
For
this
cause
therefore
have
I
called
for
you,
to
see
you,
and
to
speak
with
you:
because
that
for
the
hope
of
Israel
I
am
bound
with
this
chain.
028:021
And
they
said
unto
him,
We
neither
received
letters
out
of
Judaea
concerning
thee,
neither
any
of
the
brethren
that
came
shewed
or
spake
any
harm
of
thee.
028:022
But
we
desire
to
hear
of
thee
what
thou
thinkest:
for
as
concerning
this
sect,
we
know
that
every
where
it
is
spoken
against.
028:023
And
when
they
had
appointed
him
a
day,
there
came
many
to
him
into
his
lodging;
to
whom
he
expounded
and
testified
the
kingdom
of
God,
persuading
them
concerning
Jesus,
both
out
of
the
law
of
Moses,
and
out
of
the
prophets,
from
morning
till
evening.
028:024
And
some
believed
the
things
which
were
spoken,
and
some
believed
not.
028:025
And
when
they
agreed
not
among
themselves,
they
departed,
after
that
Paul
had
spoken
one
word,
Well
spake
the
Holy
Ghost
by
Esaias
the
prophet
unto
our
fathers,
028:026
Saying,
Go
unto
this
people,
and
say,
Hearing
ye
shall
hear,
and
shall
not
understand;
and
seeing
ye
shall
see,
and
not
perceive:
