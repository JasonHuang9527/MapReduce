028:027
For
the
heart
of
this
people
is
waxed
gross,
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
hearing,
and
their
eyes
have
they
closed;
lest
they
should
see
with
their
eyes,
and
hear
with
their
ears,
and
understand
with
their
heart,
and
should
be
converted,
and
I
should
heal
them.
028:028
Be
it
known
therefore
unto
you,
that
the
salvation
of
God
is
sent
unto
the
Gentiles,
and
that
they
will
hear
it.
028:029
And
when
he
had
said
these
words,
the
Jews
departed,
and
had
great
reasoning
among
themselves.
028:030
And
Paul
dwelt
two
whole
years
in
his
own
hired
house,
and
received
all
that
came
in
unto
him,
028:031
Preaching
the
kingdom
of
God,
and
teaching
those
things
which
concern
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
with
all
confidence,
no
man
forbidding
him.
Book
45	Romans
001:001
Paul,
a
servant
of
Jesus
Christ,
called
to
be
an
apostle,
separated
unto
the
gospel
of
God,
001:002
(Which
he
had
promised
afore
by
his
prophets
in
the
holy
scriptures,)
001:003
Concerning
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord,
which
was
made
of
the
seed
of
David
according
to
the
flesh;
001:004
And
declared
to
be
the
Son
of
God
with
power,
according
to
the
spirit
of
holiness,
by
the
resurrection
from
the
dead:
001:005
By
whom
we
have
received
grace
and
apostleship,
for
obedience
to
the
faith
among
all
nations,
for
his
name:
001:006
Among
whom
are
ye
also
the
called
of
Jesus
Christ:
001:007
To
all
that
be
in
Rome,
beloved
of
God,
called
to
be
saints:
Grace
to
you
and
peace
from
God
our
Father,
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
001:008
First,
I
thank
my
God
through
Jesus
Christ
for
you
all,
that
your
faith
is
spoken
of
throughout
the
whole
world.
001:009
For
God
is
my
witness,
whom
I
serve
with
my
spirit
in
the
gospel
of
his
Son,
that
without
ceasing
I
make
mention
of
you
always
in
my
prayers;
001:010
Making
request,
if
by
any
means
now
at
length
I
might
have
a
prosperous
journey
by
the
will
of
God
to
come
unto
you.
001:011
For
I
long
to
see
you,
that
I
may
impart
unto
you
some
spiritual
gift,
to
the
end
ye
may
be
established;
001:012
That
is,
that
I
may
be
comforted
together
with
you
by
the
mutual
faith
both
of
you
and
me.
001:013
Now
I
would
not
have
you
ignorant,
brethren,
that
oftentimes
I
purposed
to
come
unto
you,
(but
was
let
hitherto,)
that
I
might
have
some
fruit
among
you
also,
even
as
among
other
Gentiles.
001:014
I
am
debtor
both
to
the
Greeks,
and
to
the
Barbarians;
both
to
the
wise,
and
to
the
unwise.
001:015
So,
as
much
as
in
me
is,
I
am
ready
to
preach
the
gospel
to
you
that
are
at
Rome
also.
001:016
For
I
am
not
ashamed
of
the
gospel
of
Christ:
for
it
is
the
power
of
God
unto
salvation
to
every
one
that
believeth;
to
the
Jew
first,
and
also
to
the
Greek.
001:017
For
therein
is
the
righteousness
of
God
revealed
from
faith
to
faith:
as
it
is
written,
The
just
shall
live
by
faith.
001:018
For
the
wrath
of
God
is
revealed
from
heaven
against
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
men,
who
hold
the
truth
in
unrighteousness;
001:019
Because
that
which
may
be
known
of
God
is
manifest
in
them;
for
God
hath
shewed
it
unto
them.
001:020
For
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
seen,
being
understood
by
the
things
that
are
made,
even
his
eternal
power
and
Godhead;
so
that
they
are
without
excuse:
001:021
Because
that,
when
they
knew
God,
they
glorified
him
not
as
God,
neither
were
thankful;
but
became
vain
in
their
imaginations,
and
their
foolish
heart
was
darkened.
001:022
Professing
themselves
to
be
wise,
they
became
fools,
001:023
And
changed
the
glory
of
the
uncorruptible
God
into
an
image
made
like
to
corruptible
man,
and
to
birds,
and
fourfooted
beasts,
and
creeping
things.
001:024
Wherefore
God
also
gave
them
up
to
uncleanness
through
the
lusts
of
their
own
hearts,
to
dishonour
their
own
bodies
between
themselves:
001:025
Who
changed
the
truth
of
God
into
a
lie,
and
worshipped
and
served
the
creature
more
than
the
Creator,
who
is
blessed
for
ever.
Amen.
001:026
For
this
cause
God
gave
them
up
unto
vile
affections:
for
even
their
women
did
change
the
natural
use
into
that
which
is
against
nature:
001:027
And
likewise
also
the
men,
leaving
the
natural
use
of
the
woman,
burned
in
their
lust
one
toward
another;
men
with
men
working
that
which
is
unseemly,
and
receiving
in
themselves
that
recompence
of
their
error
which
was
meet.
001:028
And
even
as
they
did
not
like
to
retain
God
in
their
knowledge,
God
gave
them
over
to
a
reprobate
mind,
to
do
those
things
which
are
not
convenient;
001:029
Being
filled
with
all
unrighteousness,
fornication,
wickedness,
covetousness,
maliciousness;
full
of
envy,
murder,
debate,
deceit,
malignity;
whisperers,
001:030
Backbiters,
haters
of
God,
despiteful,
proud,
boasters,
inventors
of
evil
things,
disobedient
to
parents,
001:031
Without
understanding,
covenantbreakers,
without
natural
affection,
implacable,
unmerciful:
001:032
Who
knowing
the
judgment
of
God,
that
they
which
commit
such
things
are
worthy
of
death,
not
only
do
the
same,
but
have
pleasure
in
them
that
do
them.
002:001
Therefore
thou
art
inexcusable,
O
man,
whosoever
thou
art
that
judgest:
for
wherein
thou
judgest
another,
thou
condemnest
thyself;
for
thou
that
judgest
doest
the
same
things.
002:002
But
we
are
sure
that
the
judgment
of
God
is
according
to
truth
against
them
which
commit
such
things.
002:003
And
thinkest
thou
this,
O
man,
that
judgest
them
which
do
such
things,
and
doest
the
same,
that
thou
shalt
escape
the
judgment
of
God?
002:004
Or
despisest
thou
the
riches
of
his
goodness
and
forbearance
and
longsuffering;
not
knowing
that
the
goodness
of
God
leadeth
thee
to
repentance?
002:005
But
after
thy
hardness
and
impenitent
heart
treasurest
up
unto
thyself
wrath
against
the
day
of
wrath
and
revelation
of
the
righteous
judgment
of
God;
002:006
Who
will
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
deeds:
002:007
To
them
who
by
patient
continuance
in
well
doing
seek
for
glory
and
honour
and
immortality,
eternal
life:
002:008
But
unto
them
that
are
contentious,
and
do
not
obey
the
truth,
but
obey
unrighteousness,
indignation
and
wrath,
002:009
Tribulation
and
anguish,
upon
every
soul
of
man
that
doeth
evil,
of
the
Jew
first,
and
also
of
the
Gentile;
002:010
But
glory,
honour,
and
peace,
to
every
man
that
worketh
good,
to
the
Jew
first,
and
also
to
the
Gentile:
002:011
For
there
is
no
respect
of
persons
with
God.
002:012
For
as
many
as
have
sinned
without
law
shall
also
perish
without
law:
and
as
many
as
have
sinned
in
the
law
shall
be
judged
by
the
law;
002:013
(For
not
the
hearers
of
the
law
are
just
before
God,
but
the
doers
of
the
law
shall
be
justified.
002:014
For
when
the
Gentiles,
which
have
not
the
law,
do
by
nature
the
things
contained
in
the
law,
these,
having
not
the
law,
are
a
law
unto
themselves:
002:015
Which
shew
the
work
of
the
law
written
in
their
hearts,
their
conscience
also
bearing
witness,
and
their
thoughts
the
mean
while
accusing
or
else
excusing
one
another;)
002:016
In
the
day
when
God
shall
judge
the
secrets
of
men
by
Jesus
Christ
according
to
my
gospel.
002:017
Behold,
thou
art
called
a
Jew,
and
restest
in
the
law,
and
makest
thy
boast
of
God,
002:018
And
knowest
his
will,
and
approvest
the
things
that
are
more
excellent,
being
instructed
out
of
the
law;
002:019
And
art
confident
that
thou
thyself
art
a
guide
of
the
blind,
a
light
of
them
which
are
in
darkness,
002:020
An
instructor
of
the
foolish,
a
teacher
of
babes,
which
hast
the
form
of
knowledge
and
of
the
truth
in
the
law.
002:021
Thou
therefore
which
teachest
another,
teachest
thou
not
thyself?
thou
that
preachest
a
man
should
not
steal,
dost
thou
steal?
002:022
Thou
that
sayest
a
man
should
not
commit
adultery,
dost
thou
commit
adultery?
thou
that
abhorrest
idols,
dost
thou
commit
sacrilege?
002:023
Thou
that
makest
thy
boast
of
the
law,
through
breaking
the
law
dishonourest
thou
God?
002:024
For
the
name
of
God
is
blasphemed
among
the
Gentiles
through
you,
as
it
is
written.
002:025
For
circumcision
verily
profiteth,
if
thou
keep
the
law:
but
if
thou
be
a
breaker
of
the
law,
thy
circumcision
is
made
uncircumcision.
002:026
Therefore
if
the
uncircumcision
keep
the
righteousness
of
the
law,
shall
not
his
uncircumcision
be
counted
for
circumcision?
002:027
And
shall
not
uncircumcision
which
is
by
nature,
if
it
fulfil
the
law,
judge
thee,
who
by
the
letter
and
circumcision
dost
transgress
the
law?
002:028
For
he
is
not
a
Jew,
which
is
one
outwardly;
neither
is
that
circumcision,
which
is
outward
in
the
flesh:
002:029
But
he
is
a
Jew,
which
is
one
inwardly;
and
circumcision
is
that
of
the
heart,
in
the
spirit,
and
not
in
the
letter;
whose
praise
is
not
of
men,
but
of
God.
003:001
What
advantage
then
hath
the
Jew?
or
what
profit
is
there
of
circumcision?
003:002
Much
every
way:
chiefly,
because
that
unto
them
were
committed
the
oracles
of
God.
003:003
For
what
if
some
did
not
believe?
shall
their
unbelief
make
the
faith
of
God
without
effect?
003:004
God
forbid:
yea,
let
God
be
true,
but
every
man
a
liar;
as
it
is
written,
That
thou
mightest
be
justified
in
thy
sayings,
and
mightest
overcome
when
thou
art
judged.
003:005
But
if
our
unrighteousness
commend
the
righteousness
of
God,
what
shall
we
say?
Is
God
unrighteous
who
taketh
vengeance?
(I
speak
as
a
man)
003:006
God
forbid:
for
then
how
shall
God
judge
the
world?
003:007
For
if
the
truth
of
God
hath
more
abounded
through
my
lie
unto
his
glory;
why
yet
am
I
also
judged
as
a
sinner?
003:008
And
not
rather,
(as
we
be
slanderously
reported,
and
as
some
affirm
that
we
say,)
Let
us
do
evil,
that
good
may
come?
whose
damnation
is
just.
003:009
What
then?
are
we
better
than
they?
No,
in
no
wise:
for
we
have
before
proved
both
Jews
and
Gentiles,
that
they
are
all
under
sin;
003:010
As
it
is
written,
There
is
none
righteous,
no,
not
one:
003:011
There
is
none
that
understandeth,
there
is
none
that
seeketh
after
God.
003:012
They
are
all
gone
out
of
the
way,
they
are
together
become
unprofitable;
there
is
none
that
doeth
good,
no,
not
one.
003:013
Their
throat
is
an
open
sepulchre;
with
their
tongues
they
have
used
deceit;
the
poison
of
asps
is
under
their
lips:
003:014
Whose
mouth
is
full
of
cursing
and
bitterness:
003:015
Their
feet
are
swift
to
shed
blood:
003:016
Destruction
and
misery
are
in
their
ways:
003:017
And
the
way
of
peace
have
they
not
known:
003:018
There
is
no
fear
of
God
before
their
eyes.
003:019
Now
we
know
that
what
things
soever
the
law
saith,
it
saith
to
them
who
are
under
the
law:
that
every
mouth
may
be
stopped,
and
all
the
world
may
become
guilty
before
God.
003:020
Therefore
by
the
deeds
of
the
law
there
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
in
his
sight:
for
by
the
law
is
the
knowledge
of
sin.
003:021
But
now
the
righteousness
of
God
without
the
law
is
manifested,
being
witnessed
by
the
law
and
the
prophets;
003:022
Even
the
righteousness
of
God
which
is
by
faith
of
Jesus
Christ
unto
all
and
upon
all
them
that
believe:
for
there
is
no
difference:
003:023
For
all
have
sinned,
and
come
short
of
the
glory
of
God;
003:024
Being
justified
freely
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
Christ
Jesus:
003:025
Whom
God
hath
set
forth
to
be
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
blood,
to
declare
his
righteousness
for
the
remission
of
sins
that
are
past,
through
the
forbearance
of
God;
003:026
To
declare,
I
say,
at
this
time
his
righteousness:
that
he
might
be
just,
and
the
justifier
of
him
which
believeth
in
Jesus.
003:027
Where
is
boasting
then?
It
is
excluded.
By
what
law?
of
works?
Nay:
but
by
the
law
of
faith.
003:028
Therefore
we
conclude
that
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
without
the
deeds
of
the
law.
003:029
Is
he
the
God
of
the
Jews
only?
is
he
not
also
of
the
Gentiles?
Yes,
of
the
Gentiles
also:
003:030
Seeing
it
is
one
God,
which
shall
justify
the
circumcision
by
faith,
and
uncircumcision
through
faith.
003:031
Do
we
then
make
void
the
law
through
faith?
God
forbid:
yea,
we
establish
the
law.
004:001
What
shall
we
say
then
that
Abraham
our
father,
as
pertaining
to
the
flesh,
hath
found?
004:002
For
if
Abraham
were
justified
by
works,
he
hath
whereof
to
glory;
but
not
before
God.
004:003
For
what
saith
the
scripture?
Abraham
believed
God,
and
it
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness.
004:004
Now
to
him
that
worketh
is
the
reward
not
reckoned
of
grace,
but
of
debt.
004:005
But
to
him
that
worketh
not,
but
believeth
on
him
that
justifieth
the
ungodly,
his
faith
is
counted
for
righteousness.
004:006
Even
as
David
also
describeth
the
blessedness
of
the
man,
unto
whom
God
imputeth
righteousness
without
works,
004:007
Saying,
Blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities
are
forgiven,
and
whose
sins
are
covered.
004:008
Blessed
is
the
man
to
whom
the
Lord
will
not
impute
sin.
004:009
Cometh
this
blessedness
then
upon
the
circumcision
only,
or
upon
the
uncircumcision
also?
for
we
say
that
faith
was
reckoned
to
Abraham
for
righteousness.
004:010
How
was
it
then
reckoned?
when
he
was
in
circumcision,
or
in
uncircumcision?
Not
in
circumcision,
but
in
uncircumcision.
004:011
And
he
received
the
sign
of
circumcision,
a
seal
of
the
righteousness
of
the
faith
which
he
had
yet
being
uncircumcised:
that
he
might
be
the
father
of
all
them
that
believe,
though
they
be
not
circumcised;
that
righteousness
might
be
imputed
unto
them
also:
004:012
And
the
father
of
circumcision
to
them
who
are
not
of
the
circumcision
only,
but
who
also
walk
in
the
steps
of
that
faith
of
our
father
Abraham,
which
he
had
being
yet
uncircumcised.
004:013
For
the
promise,
that
he
should
be
the
heir
of
the
world,
was
not
to
Abraham,
or
to
his
seed,
through
the
law,
but
through
the
righteousness
of
faith.
004:014
For
if
they
which
are
of
the
law
be
heirs,
faith
is
made
void,
and
the
promise
made
of
none
effect:
004:015
Because
the
law
worketh
wrath:
for
where
no
law
is,
there
is
no
transgression.
004:016
Therefore
it
is
of
faith,
that
it
might
be
by
grace;
to
the
end
the
promise
might
be
sure
to
all
the
seed;
not
to
that
only
which
is
of
the
law,
but
to
that
also
which
is
of
the
faith
of
Abraham;
who
is
the
father
of
us
all,
004:017
(As
it
is
written,
I
have
made
thee
a
father
of
many
nations,)
before
him
whom
he
believed,
even
God,
who
quickeneth
the
dead,
and
calleth
those
things
which
be
not
as
though
they
were.
004:018
Who
against
hope
believed
in
hope,
that
he
might
become
the
father
of
many
nations,
according
to
that
which
was
spoken,
So
shall
thy
seed
be.
004:019
And
being
not
weak
in
faith,
he
considered
not
his
own
body
now
dead,
when
he
was
about
an
hundred
years
old,
neither
yet
the
deadness
of
Sarah's
womb:
004:020
He
staggered
not
at
the
promise
of
God
through
unbelief;
but
was
strong
in
faith,
giving
glory
to
God;
004:021
And
being
fully
persuaded
that,
what
he
had
promised,
he
was
able
also
to
perform.
004:022
And
therefore
it
was
imputed
to
him
for
righteousness.
004:023
Now
it
was
not
written
for
his
sake
alone,
that
it
was
imputed
to
him;
004:024
But
for
us
also,
to
whom
it
shall
be
imputed,
if
we
believe
on
him
that
raised
up
Jesus
our
Lord
from
the
dead;
004:025
Who
was
delivered
for
our
offences,
and
was
raised
again
for
our
justification.
005:001
Therefore
being
justified
by
faith,
we
have
peace
with
God
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ:
005:002
By
whom
also
we
have
access
by
faith
into
this
grace
wherein
we
stand,
and
rejoice
in
hope
of
the
glory
of
God.
005:003
And
not
only
so,
but
we
glory
in
tribulations
also:
knowing
that
tribulation
worketh
patience;
005:004
And
patience,
experience;
and
experience,
hope:
005:005
And
hope
maketh
not
ashamed;
because
the
love
of
God
is
shed
abroad
in
our
hearts
by
the
Holy
Ghost
which
is
given
unto
us.
005:006
For
when
we
were
yet
without
strength,
in
due
time
Christ
died
for
the
ungodly.
005:007
For
scarcely
for
a
righteous
man
will
one
die:
yet
peradventure
for
a
good
man
some
would
even
dare
to
die.
005:008
But
God
commendeth
his
love
toward
us,
in
that,
while
we
were
yet
sinners,
Christ
died
for
us.
005:009
Much
more
then,
being
now
justified
by
his
blood,
we
shall
be
saved
from
wrath
through
him.
005:010
For
if,
when
we
were
enemies,
we
were
reconciled
to
God
by
the
death
of
his
Son,
much
more,
being
reconciled,
we
shall
be
saved
by
his
life.
005:011
And
not
only
so,
but
we
also
joy
in
God
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
by
whom
we
have
now
received
the
atonement.
005:012
Wherefore,
as
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world,
and
death
by
sin;
and
so
death
passed
upon
all
men,
for
that
all
have
sinned:
005:013
(For
until
the
law
sin
was
in
the
world:
but
sin
is
not
imputed
when
there
is
no
law.
005:014
Nevertheless
death
reigned
from
Adam
to
Moses,
even
over
them
that
had
not
sinned
after
the
similitude
of
Adam's
transgression,
who
is
the
figure
of
him
that
was
to
come.
005:015
But
not
as
the
offence,
so
also
is
the
free
gift.
For
if
through
the
offence
of
one
many
be
dead,
much
more
the
grace
of
God,
and
the
gift
by
grace,
which
is
by
one
man,
Jesus
Christ,
hath
abounded
unto
many.
005:016
And
not
as
it
was
by
one
that
sinned,
so
is
the
gift:
for
the
judgment
was
by
one
to
condemnation,
but
the
free
gift
is
of
many
offences
unto
justification.
005:017
For
if
by
one
man's
offence
death
reigned
by
one;
much
more
they
which
receive
abundance
of
grace
and
of
the
gift
of
righteousness
shall
reign
in
life
by
one,
Jesus
Christ.)
005:018
Therefore
as
by
the
offence
of
one
judgment
came
upon
all
men
to
condemnation;
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
the
free
gift
came
upon
all
men
unto
justification
of
life.
005:019
For
as
by
one
man's
disobedience
many
were
made
sinners,
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
righteous.
005:020
Moreover
the
law
entered,
that
the
offence
might
abound.
But
where
sin
abounded,
grace
did
much
more
abound:
005:021
That
as
sin
hath
reigned
unto
death,
even
so
might
grace
reign
through
righteousness
unto
eternal
life
by
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord.
006:001
What
shall
we
say
then?
Shall
we
continue
in
sin,
that
grace
may
abound?
006:002
God
forbid.
How
shall
we,
that
are
dead
to
sin,
live
any
longer
therein?
006:003
Know
ye
not,
that
so
many
of
us
as
were
baptized
into
Jesus
Christ
were
baptized
into
his
death?
006:004
Therefore
we
are
buried
with
him
by
baptism
into
death:
that
like
as
Christ
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
by
the
glory
of
the
Father,
even
so
we
also
should
walk
in
newness
of
life.
006:005
For
if
we
have
been
planted
together
in
the
likeness
of
his
death,
we
shall
be
also
in
the
likeness
of
his
resurrection:
006:006
Knowing
this,
that
our
old
man
is
crucified
with
him,
that
the
body
of
sin
might
be
destroyed,
that
henceforth
we
should
not
serve
sin.
006:007
For
he
that
is
dead
is
freed
from
sin.
006:008
Now
if
we
be
dead
with
Christ,
we
believe
that
we
shall
also
live
with
him:
006:009
Knowing
that
Christ
being
raised
from
the
dead
dieth
no
more;
death
hath
no
more
dominion
over
him.
006:010
For
in
that
he
died,
he
died
unto
sin
once:
but
in
that
he
liveth,
he
liveth
unto
God.
006:011
Likewise
reckon
ye
also
yourselves
to
be
dead
indeed
unto
sin,
but
alive
unto
God
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord.
006:012
Let
not
sin
therefore
reign
in
your
mortal
body,
that
ye
should
obey
it
in
the
lusts
thereof.
006:013
Neither
yield
ye
your
members
as
instruments
of
unrighteousness
unto
sin:
but
yield
yourselves
unto
God,
as
those
that
are
alive
from
the
dead,
and
your
members
as
instruments
of
righteousness
unto
God.
006:014
For
sin
shall
not
have
dominion
over
you:
for
ye
are
not
under
the
law,
but
under
grace.
006:015
What
then?
shall
we
sin,
because
we
are
not
under
the
law,
but
under
grace?
God
forbid.
006:016
Know
ye
not,
that
to
whom
ye
yield
yourselves
servants
to
obey,
his
servants
ye
are
to
whom
ye
obey;
whether
of
sin
unto
death,
or
of
obedience
unto
righteousness?
006:017
But
God
be
thanked,
that
ye
were
the
servants
of
sin,
but
ye
have
obeyed
from
the
heart
that
form
of
doctrine
which
was
delivered
you.
006:018
Being
then
made
free
from
sin,
ye
became
the
servants
of
righteousness.
006:019
I
speak
after
the
manner
of
men
because
of
the
infirmity
of
your
flesh:
for
as
ye
have
yielded
your
members
servants
to
uncleanness
and
to
iniquity
unto
iniquity;
even
so
now
yield
your
members
servants
to
righteousness
unto
holiness.
006:020
For
when
ye
were
the
servants
of
sin,
ye
were
free
from
righteousness.
006:021
What
fruit
had
ye
then
in
those
things
whereof
ye
are
now
ashamed?
for
the
end
of
those
things
is
death.
006:022
But
now
being
made
free
from
sin,
and
become
servants
to
God,
ye
have
your
fruit
unto
holiness,
and
the
end
everlasting
life.
006:023
For
the
wages
of
sin
is
death;
but
the
gift
of
God
is
eternal
life
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord.
007:001
Know
ye
not,
brethren,
(for
I
speak
to
them
that
know
the
law,)
how
that
the
law
hath
dominion
over
a
man
as
long
as
he
liveth?
007:002
For
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
is
bound
by
the
law
to
her
husband
so
long
as
he
liveth;
but
if
the
husband
be
dead,
she
is
loosed
from
the
law
of
her
husband.
007:003
So
then
if,
while
her
husband
liveth,
she
be
married
to
another
man,
she
shall
be
called
an
adulteress:
but
if
her
husband
be
dead,
she
is
free
from
that
law;
so
that
she
is
no
adulteress,
though
she
be
married
to
another
man.
007:004
Wherefore,
my
brethren,
ye
also
are
become
dead
to
the
law
by
the
body
of
Christ;
that
ye
should
be
married
to
another,
even
to
him
who
is
raised
from
the
dead,
that
we
should
bring
forth
fruit
unto
God.
007:005
For
when
we
were
in
the
flesh,
the
motions
of
sins,
which
were
by
the
law,
did
work
in
our
members
to
bring
forth
fruit
unto
death.
007:006
But
now
we
are
delivered
from
the
law,
that
being
dead
wherein
we
were
held;
that
we
should
serve
in
newness
of
spirit,
and
not
in
the
oldness
of
the
letter.
007:007
What
shall
we
say
then?
Is
the
law
sin?
God
forbid.
Nay,
I
had
not
known
sin,
but
by
the
law:
for
I
had
not
known
lust,
except
the
law
had
said,
Thou
shalt
not
covet.
007:008
But
sin,
taking
occasion
by
the
commandment,
wrought
in
me
all
manner
of
concupiscence.
For
without
the
law
sin
was
dead.
007:009
For
I
was
alive
without
the
law
once:
but
when
the
commandment
came,
sin
revived,
and
I
died.
007:010
And
the
commandment,
which
was
ordained
to
life,
I
found
to
be
unto
death.
007:011
For
sin,
taking
occasion
by
the
commandment,
deceived
me,
and
by
it
slew
me.
007:012
Wherefore
the
law
is
holy,
and
the
commandment
holy,
and
just,
and
good.
007:013
Was
then
that
which
is
good
made
death
unto
me?
God
forbid.
But
sin,
that
it
might
appear
sin,
working
death
in
me
by
that
which
is
good;
that
sin
by
the
commandment
might
become
exceeding
sinful.
007:014
For
we
know
that
the
law
is
spiritual:
but
I
am
carnal,
sold
under
sin.
007:015
For
that
which
I
do
I
allow
not:
for
what
I
would,
that
do
I
not;
but
what
I
hate,
that
do
I.
007:016
