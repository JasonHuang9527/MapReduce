If
then
I
do
that
which
I
would
not,
I
consent
unto
the
law
that
it
is
good.
007:017
Now
then
it
is
no
more
I
that
do
it,
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
me.
007:018
For
I
know
that
in
me
(that
is,
in
my
flesh,)
dwelleth
no
good
thing:
for
to
will
is
present
with
me;
but
how
to
perform
that
which
is
good
I
find
not.
007:019
For
the
good
that
I
would
I
do
not:
but
the
evil
which
I
would
not,
that
I
do.
007:020
Now
if
I
do
that
I
would
not,
it
is
no
more
I
that
do
it,
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
me.
007:021
I
find
then
a
law,
that,
when
I
would
do
good,
evil
is
present
with
me.
007:022
For
I
delight
in
the
law
of
God
after
the
inward
man:
007:023
But
I
see
another
law
in
my
members,
warring
against
the
law
of
my
mind,
and
bringing
me
into
captivity
to
the
law
of
sin
which
is
in
my
members.
007:024
O
wretched
man
that
I
am!
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death?
007:025
I
thank
God
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord.
So
then
with
the
mind
I
myself
serve
the
law
of
God;
but
with
the
flesh
the
law
of
sin.
008:001
There
is
therefore
now
no
condemnation
to
them
which
are
in
Christ
Jesus,
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh,
but
after
the
Spirit.
008:002
For
the
law
of
the
Spirit
of
life
in
Christ
Jesus
hath
made
me
free
from
the
law
of
sin
and
death.
008:003
For
what
the
law
could
not
do,
in
that
it
was
weak
through
the
flesh,
God
sending
his
own
Son
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
flesh,
and
for
sin,
condemned
sin
in
the
flesh:
008:004
That
the
righteousness
of
the
law
might
be
fulfilled
in
us,
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh,
but
after
the
Spirit.
008:005
For
they
that
are
after
the
flesh
do
mind
the
things
of
the
flesh;
but
they
that
are
after
the
Spirit
the
things
of
the
Spirit.
008:006
For
to
be
carnally
minded
is
death;
but
to
be
spiritually
minded
is
life
and
peace.
008:007
Because
the
carnal
mind
is
enmity
against
God:
for
it
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
God,
neither
indeed
can
be.
008:008
So
then
they
that
are
in
the
flesh
cannot
please
God.
008:009
But
ye
are
not
in
the
flesh,
but
in
the
Spirit,
if
so
be
that
the
Spirit
of
God
dwell
in
you.
Now
if
any
man
have
not
the
Spirit
of
Christ,
he
is
none
of
his.
008:010
And
if
Christ
be
in
you,
the
body
is
dead
because
of
sin;
but
the
Spirit
is
life
because
of
righteousness.
008:011
But
if
the
Spirit
of
him
that
raised
up
Jesus
from
the
dead
dwell
in
you,
he
that
raised
up
Christ
from
the
dead
shall
also
quicken
your
mortal
bodies
by
his
Spirit
that
dwelleth
in
you.
008:012
Therefore,
brethren,
we
are
debtors,
not
to
the
flesh,
to
live
after
the
flesh.
008:013
For
if
ye
live
after
the
flesh,
ye
shall
die:
but
if
ye
through
the
Spirit
do
mortify
the
deeds
of
the
body,
ye
shall
live.
008:014
For
as
many
as
are
led
by
the
Spirit
of
God,
they
are
the
sons
of
God.
008:015
For
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
again
to
fear;
but
ye
have
received
the
Spirit
of
adoption,
whereby
we
cry,
Abba,
Father.
008:016
The
Spirit
itself
beareth
witness
with
our
spirit,
that
we
are
the
children
of
God:
008:017
And
if
children,
then
heirs;
heirs
of
God,
and
joint-heirs
with
Christ;
if
so
be
that
we
suffer
with
him,
that
we
may
be
also
glorified
together.
008:018
For
I
reckon
that
the
sufferings
of
this
present
time
are
not
worthy
to
be
compared
with
the
glory
which
shall
be
revealed
in
us.
008:019
For
the
earnest
expectation
of
the
creature
waiteth
for
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
God.
008:020
For
the
creature
was
made
subject
to
vanity,
not
willingly,
but
by
reason
of
him
who
hath
subjected
the
same
in
hope,
008:021
Because
the
creature
itself
also
shall
be
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
God.
008:022
For
we
know
that
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
in
pain
together
until
now.
008:023
And
not
only
they,
but
ourselves
also,
which
have
the
firstfruits
of
the
Spirit,
even
we
ourselves
groan
within
ourselves,
waiting
for
the
adoption,
to
wit,
the
redemption
of
our
body.
008:024
For
we
are
saved
by
hope:
but
hope
that
is
seen
is
not
hope:
for
what
a
man
seeth,
why
doth
he
yet
hope
for?
008:025
But
if
we
hope
for
that
we
see
not,
then
do
we
with
patience
wait
for
it.
008:026
Likewise
the
Spirit
also
helpeth
our
infirmities:
for
we
know
not
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
ought:
but
the
Spirit
itself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
cannot
be
uttered.
008:027
And
he
that
searcheth
the
hearts
knoweth
what
is
the
mind
of
the
Spirit,
because
he
maketh
intercession
for
the
saints
according
to
the
will
of
God.
008:028
And
we
know
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
God,
to
them
who
are
the
called
according
to
his
purpose.
008:029
For
whom
he
did
foreknow,
he
also
did
predestinate
to
be
conformed
to
the
image
of
his
Son,
that
he
might
be
the
firstborn
among
many
brethren.
008:030
Moreover
whom
he
did
predestinate,
them
he
also
called:
and
whom
he
called,
them
he
also
justified:
and
whom
he
justified,
them
he
also
glorified.
008:031
What
shall
we
then
say
to
these
things?
If
God
be
for
us,
who
can
be
against
us?
008:032
He
that
spared
not
his
own
Son,
but
delivered
him
up
for
us
all,
how
shall
he
not
with
him
also
freely
give
us
all
things?
008:033
Who
shall
lay
any
thing
to
the
charge
of
God's
elect?
It
is
God
that
justifieth.
008:034
Who
is
he
that
condemneth?
It
is
Christ
that
died,
yea
rather,
that
is
risen
again,
who
is
even
at
the
right
hand
of
God,
who
also
maketh
intercession
for
us.
008:035
Who
shall
separate
us
from
the
love
of
Christ?
shall
tribulation,
or
distress,
or
persecution,
or
famine,
or
nakedness,
or
peril,
or
sword?
008:036
As
it
is
written,
For
thy
sake
we
are
killed
all
the
day
long;
we
are
accounted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter.
008:037
Nay,
in
all
these
things
we
are
more
than
conquerors
through
him
that
loved
us.
008:038
For
I
am
persuaded,
that
neither
death,
nor
life,
nor
angels,
nor
principalities,
nor
powers,
nor
things
present,
nor
things
to
come,
008:039
Nor
height,
nor
depth,
nor
any
other
creature,
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
God,
which
is
in
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord.
009:001
I
say
the
truth
in
Christ,
I
lie
not,
my
conscience
also
bearing
me
witness
in
the
Holy
Ghost,
009:002
That
I
have
great
heaviness
and
continual
sorrow
in
my
heart.
009:003
For
I
could
wish
that
myself
were
accursed
from
Christ
for
my
brethren,
my
kinsmen
according
to
the
flesh:
009:004
Who
are
Israelites;
to
whom
pertaineth
the
adoption,
and
the
glory,
and
the
covenants,
and
the
giving
of
the
law,
and
the
service
of
God,
and
the
promises;
009:005
Whose
are
the
fathers,
and
of
whom
as
concerning
the
flesh
Christ
came,
who
is
over
all,
God
blessed
for
ever.
Amen.
009:006
Not
as
though
the
word
of
God
hath
taken
none
effect.
For
they
are
not
all
Israel,
which
are
of
Israel:
009:007
Neither,
because
they
are
the
seed
of
Abraham,
are
they
all
children:
but,
In
Isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called.
009:008
That
is,
They
which
are
the
children
of
the
flesh,
these
are
not
the
children
of
God:
but
the
children
of
the
promise
are
counted
for
the
seed.
009:009
For
this
is
the
word
of
promise,
At
this
time
will
I
come,
and
Sarah
shall
have
a
son.
009:010
And
not
only
this;
but
when
Rebecca
also
had
conceived
by
one,
even
by
our
father
Isaac;
009:011
(For
the
children
being
not
yet
born,
neither
having
done
any
good
or
evil,
that
the
purpose
of
God
according
to
election
might
stand,
not
of
works,
but
of
him
that
calleth;)
009:012
It
was
said
unto
her,
The
elder
shall
serve
the
younger.
009:013
As
it
is
written,
Jacob
have
I
loved,
but
Esau
have
I
hated.
009:014
What
shall
we
say
then?
Is
there
unrighteousness
with
God?
God
forbid.
009:015
For
he
saith
to
Moses,
I
will
have
mercy
on
whom
I
will
have
mercy,
and
I
will
have
compassion
on
whom
I
will
have
compassion.
009:016
So
then
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth,
nor
of
him
that
runneth,
but
of
God
that
sheweth
mercy.
009:017
For
the
scripture
saith
unto
Pharaoh,
Even
for
this
same
purpose
have
I
raised
thee
up,
that
I
might
shew
my
power
in
thee,
and
that
my
name
might
be
declared
throughout
all
the
earth.
009:018
Therefore
hath
he
mercy
on
whom
he
will
have
mercy,
and
whom
he
will
he
hardeneth.
009:019
Thou
wilt
say
then
unto
me,
Why
doth
he
yet
find
fault?
For
who
hath
resisted
his
will?
009:020
Nay
but,
O
man,
who
art
thou
that
repliest
against
God?
Shall
the
thing
formed
say
to
him
that
formed
it,
Why
hast
thou
made
me
thus?
009:021
Hath
not
the
potter
power
over
the
clay,
of
the
same
lump
to
make
one
vessel
unto
honour,
and
another
unto
dishonour?
009:022
What
if
God,
willing
to
shew
his
wrath,
and
to
make
his
power
known,
endured
with
much
longsuffering
the
vessels
of
wrath
fitted
to
destruction:
009:023
And
that
he
might
make
known
the
riches
of
his
glory
on
the
vessels
of
mercy,
which
he
had
afore
prepared
unto
glory,
009:024
Even
us,
whom
he
hath
called,
not
of
the
Jews
only,
but
also
of
the
Gentiles?
009:025
As
he
saith
also
in
Osee,
I
will
call
them
my
people,
which
were
not
my
people;
and
her
beloved,
which
was
not
beloved.
009:026
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
in
the
place
where
it
was
said
unto
them,
Ye
are
not
my
people;
there
shall
they
be
called
the
children
of
the
living
God.
009:027
Esaias
also
crieth
concerning
Israel,
Though
the
number
of
the
children
of
Israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea,
a
remnant
shall
be
saved:
009:028
For
he
will
finish
the
work,
and
cut
it
short
in
righteousness:
because
a
short
work
will
the
Lord
make
upon
the
earth.
009:029
And
as
Esaias
said
before,
Except
the
Lord
of
Sabaoth
had
left
us
a
seed,
we
had
been
as
Sodoma,
and
been
made
like
unto
Gomorrha.
009:030
What
shall
we
say
then?
That
the
Gentiles,
which
followed
not
after
righteousness,
have
attained
to
righteousness,
even
the
righteousness
which
is
of
faith.
009:031
But
Israel,
which
followed
after
the
law
of
righteousness,
hath
not
attained
to
the
law
of
righteousness.
009:032
Wherefore?
Because
they
sought
it
not
by
faith,
but
as
it
were
by
the
works
of
the
law.
For
they
stumbled
at
that
stumblingstone;
009:033
As
it
is
written,
Behold,
I
lay
in
Sion
a
stumblingstone
and
rock
of
offence:
and
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
ashamed.
010:001
Brethren,
my
heart's
desire
and
prayer
to
God
for
Israel
is,
that
they
might
be
saved.
010:002
For
I
bear
them
record
that
they
have
a
zeal
of
God,
but
not
according
to
knowledge.
010:003
For
they
being
ignorant
of
God's
righteousness,
and
going
about
to
establish
their
own
righteousness,
have
not
submitted
themselves
unto
the
righteousness
of
God.
010:004
For
Christ
is
the
end
of
the
law
for
righteousness
to
every
one
that
believeth.
010:005
For
Moses
describeth
the
righteousness
which
is
of
the
law,
That
the
man
which
doeth
those
things
shall
live
by
them.
010:006
But
the
righteousness
which
is
of
faith
speaketh
on
this
wise,
Say
not
in
thine
heart,
Who
shall
ascend
into
heaven?
(that
is,
to
bring
Christ
down
from
above:)
010:007
Or,
Who
shall
descend
into
the
deep?
(that
is,
to
bring
up
Christ
again
from
the
dead.)
010:008
But
what
saith
it?
The
word
is
nigh
thee,
even
in
thy
mouth,
and
in
thy
heart:
that
is,
the
word
of
faith,
which
we
preach;
010:009
That
if
thou
shalt
confess
with
thy
mouth
the
Lord
Jesus,
and
shalt
believe
in
thine
heart
that
God
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead,
thou
shalt
be
saved.
010:010
For
with
the
heart
man
believeth
unto
righteousness;
and
with
the
mouth
confession
is
made
unto
salvation.
010:011
For
the
scripture
saith,
Whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
ashamed.
010:012
For
there
is
no
difference
between
the
Jew
and
the
Greek:
for
the
same
Lord
over
all
is
rich
unto
all
that
call
upon
him.
010:013
For
whosoever
shall
call
upon
the
name
of
the
Lord
shall
be
saved.
010:014
How
then
shall
they
call
on
him
in
whom
they
have
not
believed?
and
how
shall
they
believe
in
him
of
whom
they
have
not
heard?
and
how
shall
they
hear
without
a
preacher?
010:015
And
how
shall
they
preach,
except
they
be
sent?
as
it
is
written,
How
beautiful
are
the
feet
of
them
that
preach
the
gospel
of
peace,
and
bring
glad
tidings
of
good
things!
010:016
But
they
have
not
all
obeyed
the
gospel.
For
Esaias
saith,
Lord,
who
hath
believed
our
report?
010:017
So
then
faith
cometh
by
hearing,
and
hearing
by
the
word
of
God.
010:018
But
I
say,
Have
they
not
heard?
Yes
verily,
their
sound
went
into
all
the
earth,
and
their
words
unto
the
ends
of
the
world.
010:019
But
I
say,
Did
not
Israel
know?
First
Moses
saith,
I
will
provoke
you
to
jealousy
by
them
that
are
no
people,
and
by
a
foolish
nation
I
will
anger
you.
010:020
But
Esaias
is
very
bold,
and
saith,
I
was
found
of
them
that
sought
me
not;
I
was
made
manifest
unto
them
that
asked
not
after
me.
010:021
But
to
Israel
he
saith,
All
day
long
I
have
stretched
forth
my
hands
unto
a
disobedient
and
gainsaying
people.
011:001
I
say
then,
Hath
God
cast
away
his
people?
God
forbid.
For
I
also
am
an
Israelite,
of
the
seed
of
Abraham,
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin.
011:002
God
hath
not
cast
away
his
people
which
he
foreknew.
Wot
ye
not
what
the
scripture
saith
of
Elias?
how
he
maketh
intercession
to
God
against
Israel
saying,
011:003
Lord,
they
have
killed
thy
prophets,
and
digged
down
thine
altars;
and
I
am
left
alone,
and
they
seek
my
life.
011:004
But
what
saith
the
answer
of
God
unto
him?
I
have
reserved
to
myself
seven
thousand
men,
who
have
not
bowed
the
knee
to
the
image
of
Baal.
011:005
Even
so
then
at
this
present
time
also
there
is
a
remnant
according
to
the
election
of
grace.
011:006
And
if
by
grace,
then
is
it
no
more
of
works:
otherwise
grace
is
no
more
grace.
But
if
it
be
of
works,
then
it
is
no
more
grace:
otherwise
work
is
no
more
work.
011:007
What
then?
Israel
hath
not
obtained
that
which
he
seeketh
for;
but
the
election
hath
obtained
it,
and
the
rest
were
blinded.
011:008
(According
as
it
is
written,
God
hath
given
them
the
spirit
of
slumber,
eyes
that
they
should
not
see,
and
ears
that
they
should
not
hear;)
unto
this
day.
011:009
And
David
saith,
Let
their
table
be
made
a
snare,
and
a
trap,
and
a
stumblingblock,
and
a
recompence
unto
them:
011:010
Let
their
eyes
be
darkened,
that
they
may
not
see,
and
bow
down
their
back
alway.
011:011
I
say
then,
Have
they
stumbled
that
they
should
fall?
God
forbid:
but
rather
through
their
fall
salvation
is
come
unto
the
Gentiles,
for
to
provoke
them
to
jealousy.
011:012
Now
if
the
fall
of
them
be
the
riches
of
the
world,
and
the
diminishing
of
them
the
riches
of
the
Gentiles;
how
much
more
their
fulness?
011:013
For
I
speak
to
you
Gentiles,
inasmuch
as
I
am
the
apostle
of
the
Gentiles,
I
magnify
mine
office:
011:014
If
by
any
means
I
may
provoke
to
emulation
them
which
are
my
flesh,
and
might
save
some
of
them.
011:015
For
if
the
casting
away
of
them
be
the
reconciling
of
the
world,
what
shall
the
receiving
of
them
be,
but
life
from
the
dead?
011:016
For
if
the
firstfruit
be
holy,
the
lump
is
also
holy:
and
if
the
root
be
holy,
so
are
the
branches.
011:017
And
if
some
of
the
branches
be
broken
off,
and
thou,
being
a
wild
olive
tree,
wert
graffed
in
among
them,
and
with
them
partakest
of
the
root
and
fatness
of
the
olive
tree;
011:018
Boast
not
against
the
branches.
But
if
thou
boast,
thou
bearest
not
the
root,
but
the
root
thee.
011:019
Thou
wilt
say
then,
The
branches
were
broken
off,
that
I
might
be
graffed
in.
011:020
Well;
because
of
unbelief
they
were
broken
off,
and
thou
standest
by
faith.
Be
not
highminded,
but
fear:
011:021
For
if
God
spared
not
the
natural
branches,
take
heed
lest
he
also
spare
not
thee.
011:022
Behold
therefore
the
goodness
and
severity
of
God:
on
them
which
fell,
severity;
but
toward
thee,
goodness,
if
thou
continue
in
his
goodness:
otherwise
thou
also
shalt
be
cut
off.
011:023
And
they
also,
if
they
abide
not
still
in
unbelief,
shall
be
graffed
in:
for
God
is
able
to
graff
them
in
again.
011:024
For
if
thou
wert
cut
out
of
the
olive
tree
which
is
wild
by
nature,
and
wert
graffed
contrary
to
nature
into
a
good
olive
tree:
how
much
more
shall
these,
which
be
the
natural
branches,
be
graffed
into
their
own
olive
tree?
011:025
For
I
would
not,
brethren,
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
of
this
mystery,
lest
ye
should
be
wise
in
your
own
conceits;
that
blindness
in
part
is
happened
to
Israel,
until
the
fulness
of
the
Gentiles
be
come
in.
011:026
And
so
all
Israel
shall
be
saved:
as
it
is
written,
There
shall
come
out
of
Sion
the
Deliverer,
and
shall
turn
away
ungodliness
from
Jacob:
011:027
For
this
is
my
covenant
unto
them,
when
I
shall
take
away
their
sins.
011:028
As
concerning
the
gospel,
they
are
enemies
for
your
sakes:
but
as
touching
the
election,
they
are
beloved
for
the
father's
sakes.
011:029
For
the
gifts
and
calling
of
God
are
without
repentance.
011:030
For
as
ye
in
times
past
have
not
believed
God,
yet
have
now
obtained
mercy
through
their
unbelief:
011:031
Even
so
have
these
also
now
not
believed,
that
through
your
mercy
they
also
may
obtain
mercy.
011:032
For
God
hath
concluded
them
all
in
unbelief,
that
he
might
have
mercy
upon
all.
011:033
O
the
depth
of
the
riches
both
of
the
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
God!
how
unsearchable
are
his
judgments,
and
his
ways
past
finding
out!
011:034
For
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
Lord?
or
who
hath
been
his
counsellor?
011:035
Or
who
hath
first
given
to
him,
and
it
shall
be
recompensed
unto
him
again?
011:036
For
of
him,
and
through
him,
and
to
him,
are
all
things:
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever.
Amen.
012:001
I
beseech
you
therefore,
brethren,
by
the
mercies
of
God,
that
ye
present
your
bodies
a
living
sacrifice,
holy,
acceptable
unto
God,
which
is
your
reasonable
service.
012:002
And
be
not
conformed
to
this
world:
but
be
ye
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
your
mind,
that
ye
may
prove
what
is
that
good,
and
acceptable,
and
perfect,
will
of
God.
012:003
For
I
say,
through
the
grace
given
unto
me,
to
every
man
that
is
among
you,
not
to
think
of
himself
more
highly
than
he
ought
to
think;
but
to
think
soberly,
according
as
God
hath
dealt
to
every
man
the
measure
of
faith.
012:004
For
as
we
have
many
members
in
one
body,
and
all
members
have
not
the
same
office:
012:005
So
we,
being
many,
are
one
body
in
Christ,
and
every
one
members
one
of
another.
012:006
Having
then
gifts
differing
according
to
the
grace
that
is
given
to
us,
whether
prophecy,
let
us
prophesy
according
to
the
proportion
of
faith;
012:007
Or
ministry,
let
us
wait
on
our
ministering:
or
he
that
teacheth,
on
teaching;
012:008
Or
he
that
exhorteth,
on
exhortation:
he
that
giveth,
let
him
do
it
with
simplicity;
he
that
ruleth,
with
diligence;
he
that
sheweth
mercy,
with
cheerfulness.
012:009
Let
love
be
without
dissimulation.
Abhor
that
which
is
evil;
cleave
to
that
which
is
good.
012:010
Be
kindly
affectioned
one
to
another
with
brotherly
love;
in
honour
preferring
one
another;
012:011
Not
slothful
in
business;
fervent
in
spirit;
serving
the
Lord;
012:012
Rejoicing
in
hope;
patient
in
tribulation;
continuing
instant
in
prayer;
012:013
Distributing
to
the
necessity
of
saints;
given
to
hospitality.
012:014
Bless
them
which
persecute
you:
bless,
and
curse
not.
012:015
Rejoice
with
them
that
do
rejoice,
and
weep
with
them
that
weep.
012:016
Be
of
the
same
mind
one
toward
another.
Mind
not
high
things,
but
condescend
to
men
of
low
estate.
Be
not
wise
in
your
own
conceits.
012:017
Recompense
to
no
man
evil
for
evil.
Provide
things
honest
in
the
sight
of
all
men.
012:018
If
it
be
possible,
as
much
as
lieth
in
you,
live
peaceably
with
all
men.
012:019
Dearly
beloved,
avenge
not
yourselves,
but
rather
give
place
unto
wrath:
for
it
is
written,
Vengeance
is
mine;
I
will
repay,
saith
the
Lord.
012:020
Therefore
if
thine
enemy
hunger,
feed
him;
if
he
thirst,
give
him
drink:
for
in
so
doing
thou
shalt
heap
coals
of
fire
on
his
head.
012:021
Be
not
overcome
of
evil,
but
overcome
evil
with
good.
013:001
Let
every
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers.
For
there
is
no
power
but
of
God:
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
God.
013:002
Whosoever
therefore
resisteth
the
power,
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
God:
and
they
that
resist
shall
receive
to
themselves
damnation.
013:003
For
rulers
are
not
a
terror
to
good
works,
but
to
the
evil.
Wilt
thou
then
not
be
afraid
of
the
power?
do
that
which
is
good,
and
thou
shalt
have
praise
of
the
same:
013:004
For
he
is
the
minister
of
God
to
thee
for
good.
But
if
thou
do
that
which
is
evil,
be
afraid;
for
he
beareth
not
the
sword
in
vain:
for
he
is
the
minister
of
God,
a
revenger
to
execute
wrath
upon
him
that
doeth
evil.
013:005
Wherefore
ye
must
needs
be
subject,
not
only
for
wrath,
but
also
for
conscience
sake.
013:006
For
for
this
cause
pay
ye
tribute
also:
for
they
are
God's
ministers,
attending
continually
upon
this
very
thing.
013:007
Render
therefore
to
all
their
dues:
tribute
to
whom
tribute
is
due;
custom
to
whom
custom;
fear
to
whom
fear;
honour
to
whom
honour.
013:008
Owe
no
man
any
thing,
but
to
love
one
another:
for
he
that
loveth
another
hath
fulfilled
the
law.
013:009
For
this,
Thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery,
Thou
shalt
not
kill,
Thou
shalt
not
steal,
Thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness,
Thou
shalt
not
covet;
and
if
there
be
any
other
commandment,
it
is
briefly
comprehended
in
this
saying,
namely,
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself.
013:010
Love
worketh
no
ill
to
his
neighbour:
therefore
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law.
013:011
And
that,
knowing
the
time,
that
now
it
is
high
time
to
awake
out
of
sleep:
for
now
is
our
salvation
nearer
than
when
we
believed.
013:012
The
night
is
far
spent,
the
day
is
at
hand:
let
us
therefore
cast
off
the
works
of
darkness,
and
let
us
put
on
the
armour
of
light.
013:013
Let
us
walk
honestly,
as
in
the
day;
not
in
rioting
and
drunkenness,
not
in
chambering
and
wantonness,
not
in
strife
and
envying.
013:014
But
put
ye
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
and
make
not
provision
for
the
flesh,
to
fulfil
the
lusts
thereof.
014:001
Him
that
is
weak
in
the
faith
receive
ye,
but
not
to
doubtful
disputations.
014:002
For
one
believeth
that
he
may
eat
all
things:
another,
who
is
weak,
eateth
herbs.
014:003
Let
not
him
that
eateth
despise
him
that
eateth
not;
and
let
not
him
which
eateth
not
judge
him
that
eateth:
for
