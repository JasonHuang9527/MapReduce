God
hath
received
him.
014:004
Who
art
thou
that
judgest
another
man's
servant?
to
his
own
master
he
standeth
or
falleth.
Yea,
he
shall
be
holden
up:
for
God
is
able
to
make
him
stand.
014:005
One
man
esteemeth
one
day
above
another:
another
esteemeth
every
day
alike.
Let
every
man
be
fully
persuaded
in
his
own
mind.
014:006
He
that
regardeth
the
day,
regardeth
it
unto
the
Lord;
and
he
that
regardeth
not
the
day,
to
the
Lord
he
doth
not
regard
it.
He
that
eateth,
eateth
to
the
Lord,
for
he
giveth
God
thanks;
and
he
that
eateth
not,
to
the
Lord
he
eateth
not,
and
giveth
God
thanks.
014:007
For
none
of
us
liveth
to
himself,
and
no
man
dieth
to
himself.
014:008
For
whether
we
live,
we
live
unto
the
Lord;
and
whether
we
die,
we
die
unto
the
Lord:
whether
we
live
therefore,
or
die,
we
are
the
Lord's.
014:009
For
to
this
end
Christ
both
died,
and
rose,
and
revived,
that
he
might
be
Lord
both
of
the
dead
and
living.
014:010
But
why
dost
thou
judge
thy
brother?
or
why
dost
thou
set
at
nought
thy
brother?
for
we
shall
all
stand
before
the
judgment
seat
of
Christ.
014:011
For
it
is
written,
As
I
live,
saith
the
Lord,
every
knee
shall
bow
to
me,
and
every
tongue
shall
confess
to
God.
014:012
So
then
every
one
of
us
shall
give
account
of
himself
to
God.
014:013
Let
us
not
therefore
judge
one
another
any
more:
but
judge
this
rather,
that
no
man
put
a
stumblingblock
or
an
occasion
to
fall
in
his
brother's
way.
014:014
I
know,
and
am
persuaded
by
the
Lord
Jesus,
that
there
is
nothing
unclean
of
itself:
but
to
him
that
esteemeth
any
thing
to
be
unclean,
to
him
it
is
unclean.
014:015
But
if
thy
brother
be
grieved
with
thy
meat,
now
walkest
thou
not
charitably.
Destroy
not
him
with
thy
meat,
for
whom
Christ
died.
014:016
Let
not
then
your
good
be
evil
spoken
of:
014:017
For
the
kingdom
of
God
is
not
meat
and
drink;
but
righteousness,
and
peace,
and
joy
in
the
Holy
Ghost.
014:018
For
he
that
in
these
things
serveth
Christ
is
acceptable
to
God,
and
approved
of
men.
014:019
Let
us
therefore
follow
after
the
things
which
make
for
peace,
and
things
wherewith
one
may
edify
another.
014:020
For
meat
destroy
not
the
work
of
God.
All
things
indeed
are
pure;
but
it
is
evil
for
that
man
who
eateth
with
offence.
014:021
It
is
good
neither
to
eat
flesh,
nor
to
drink
wine,
nor
any
thing
whereby
thy
brother
stumbleth,
or
is
offended,
or
is
made
weak.
014:022
Hast
thou
faith?
have
it
to
thyself
before
God.
Happy
is
he
that
condemneth
not
himself
in
that
thing
which
he
alloweth.
014:023
And
he
that
doubteth
is
damned
if
he
eat,
because
he
eateth
not
of
faith:
for
whatsoever
is
not
of
faith
is
sin.
015:001
We
then
that
are
strong
ought
to
bear
the
infirmities
of
the
weak,
and
not
to
please
ourselves.
015:002
Let
every
one
of
us
please
his
neighbour
for
his
good
to
edification.
015:003
For
even
Christ
pleased
not
himself;
but,
as
it
is
written,
The
reproaches
of
them
that
reproached
thee
fell
on
me.
015:004
For
whatsoever
things
were
written
aforetime
were
written
for
our
learning,
that
we
through
patience
and
comfort
of
the
scriptures
might
have
hope.
015:005
Now
the
God
of
patience
and
consolation
grant
you
to
be
likeminded
one
toward
another
according
to
Christ
Jesus:
015:006
That
ye
may
with
one
mind
and
one
mouth
glorify
God,
even
the
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
015:007
Wherefore
receive
ye
one
another,
as
Christ
also
received
us
to
the
glory
of
God.
015:008
Now
I
say
that
Jesus
Christ
was
a
minister
of
the
circumcision
for
the
truth
of
God,
to
confirm
the
promises
made
unto
the
fathers:
015:009
And
that
the
Gentiles
might
glorify
God
for
his
mercy;
as
it
is
written,
For
this
cause
I
will
confess
to
thee
among
the
Gentiles,
and
sing
unto
thy
name.
015:010
And
again
he
saith,
Rejoice,
ye
Gentiles,
with
his
people.
015:011
And
again,
Praise
the
Lord,
all
ye
Gentiles;
and
laud
him,
all
ye
people.
015:012
And
again,
Esaias
saith,
There
shall
be
a
root
of
Jesse,
and
he
that
shall
rise
to
reign
over
the
Gentiles;
in
him
shall
the
Gentiles
trust.
015:013
Now
the
God
of
hope
fill
you
with
all
joy
and
peace
in
believing,
that
ye
may
abound
in
hope,
through
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost.
015:014
And
I
myself
also
am
persuaded
of
you,
my
brethren,
that
ye
also
are
full
of
goodness,
filled
with
all
knowledge,
able
also
to
admonish
one
another.
015:015
Nevertheless,
brethren,
I
have
written
the
more
boldly
unto
you
in
some
sort,
as
putting
you
in
mind,
because
of
the
grace
that
is
given
to
me
of
God,
015:016
That
I
should
be
the
minister
of
Jesus
Christ
to
the
Gentiles,
ministering
the
gospel
of
God,
that
the
offering
up
of
the
Gentiles
might
be
acceptable,
being
sanctified
by
the
Holy
Ghost.
015:017
I
have
therefore
whereof
I
may
glory
through
Jesus
Christ
in
those
things
which
pertain
to
God.
015:018
For
I
will
not
dare
to
speak
of
any
of
those
things
which
Christ
hath
not
wrought
by
me,
to
make
the
Gentiles
obedient,
by
word
and
deed,
015:019
Through
mighty
signs
and
wonders,
by
the
power
of
the
Spirit
of
God;
so
that
from
Jerusalem,
and
round
about
unto
Illyricum,
I
have
fully
preached
the
gospel
of
Christ.
015:020
Yea,
so
have
I
strived
to
preach
the
gospel,
not
where
Christ
was
named,
lest
I
should
build
upon
another
man's
foundation:
015:021
But
as
it
is
written,
To
whom
he
was
not
spoken
of,
they
shall
see:
and
they
that
have
not
heard
shall
understand.
015:022
For
which
cause
also
I
have
been
much
hindered
from
coming
to
you.
015:023
But
now
having
no
more
place
in
these
parts,
and
having
a
great
desire
these
many
years
to
come
unto
you;
015:024
Whensoever
I
take
my
journey
into
Spain,
I
will
come
to
you:
for
I
trust
to
see
you
in
my
journey,
and
to
be
brought
on
my
way
thitherward
by
you,
if
first
I
be
somewhat
filled
with
your
company.
015:025
But
now
I
go
unto
Jerusalem
to
minister
unto
the
saints.
015:026
For
it
hath
pleased
them
of
Macedonia
and
Achaia
to
make
a
certain
contribution
for
the
poor
saints
which
are
at
Jerusalem.
015:027
It
hath
pleased
them
verily;
and
their
debtors
they
are.
For
if
the
Gentiles
have
been
made
partakers
of
their
spiritual
things,
their
duty
is
also
to
minister
unto
them
in
carnal
things.
015:028
When
therefore
I
have
performed
this,
and
have
sealed
to
them
this
fruit,
I
will
come
by
you
into
Spain.
015:029
And
I
am
sure
that,
when
I
come
unto
you,
I
shall
come
in
the
fulness
of
the
blessing
of
the
gospel
of
Christ.
015:030
Now
I
beseech
you,
brethren,
for
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ's
sake,
and
for
the
love
of
the
Spirit,
that
ye
strive
together
with
me
in
your
prayers
to
God
for
me;
015:031
That
I
may
be
delivered
from
them
that
do
not
believe
in
Judaea;
and
that
my
service
which
I
have
for
Jerusalem
may
be
accepted
of
the
saints;
015:032
That
I
may
come
unto
you
with
joy
by
the
will
of
God,
and
may
with
you
be
refreshed.
015:033
Now
the
God
of
peace
be
with
you
all.
Amen.
016:001
I
commend
unto
you
Phebe
our
sister,
which
is
a
servant
of
the
church
which
is
at
Cenchrea:
016:002
That
ye
receive
her
in
the
Lord,
as
becometh
saints,
and
that
ye
assist
her
in
whatsoever
business
she
hath
need
of
you:
for
she
hath
been
a
succourer
of
many,
and
of
myself
also.
016:003
Greet
Priscilla
and
Aquila
my
helpers
in
Christ
Jesus:
016:004
Who
have
for
my
life
laid
down
their
own
necks:
unto
whom
not
only
I
give
thanks,
but
also
all
the
churches
of
the
Gentiles.
016:005
Likewise
greet
the
church
that
is
in
their
house.
Salute
my
well-beloved
Epaenetus,
who
is
the
firstfruits
of
Achaia
unto
Christ.
016:006
Greet
Mary,
who
bestowed
much
labour
on
us.
016:007
Salute
Andronicus
and
Junia,
my
kinsmen,
and
my
fellow-prisoners,
who
are
of
note
among
the
apostles,
who
also
were
in
Christ
before
me.
016:008
Greet
Amplias
my
beloved
in
the
Lord.
016:009
Salute
Urbane,
our
helper
in
Christ,
and
Stachys
my
beloved.
016:010
Salute
Apelles
approved
in
Christ.
Salute
them
which
are
of
Aristobulus'
household.
016:011
Salute
Herodion
my
kinsman.
Greet
them
that
be
of
the
household
of
Narcissus,
which
are
in
the
Lord.
016:012
Salute
Tryphena
and
Tryphosa,
who
labour
in
the
Lord.
Salute
the
beloved
Persis,
which
laboured
much
in
the
Lord.
016:013
Salute
Rufus
chosen
in
the
Lord,
and
his
mother
and
mine.
016:014
Salute
Asyncritus,
Phlegon,
Hermas,
Patrobas,
Hermes,
and
the
brethren
which
are
with
them.
016:015
Salute
Philologus,
and
Julia,
Nereus,
and
his
sister,
and
Olympas,
and
all
the
saints
which
are
with
them.
016:016
Salute
one
another
with
an
holy
kiss.
The
churches
of
Christ
salute
you.
016:017
Now
I
beseech
you,
brethren,
mark
them
which
cause
divisions
and
offences
contrary
to
the
doctrine
which
ye
have
learned;
and
avoid
them.
016:018
For
they
that
are
such
serve
not
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
but
their
own
belly;
and
by
good
words
and
fair
speeches
deceive
the
hearts
of
the
simple.
016:019
For
your
obedience
is
come
abroad
unto
all
men.
I
am
glad
therefore
on
your
behalf:
but
yet
I
would
have
you
wise
unto
that
which
is
good,
and
simple
concerning
evil.
016:020
And
the
God
of
peace
shall
bruise
Satan
under
your
feet
shortly.
The
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
you.
Amen.
016:021
Timotheus
my
workfellow,
and
Lucius,
and
Jason,
and
Sosipater,
my
kinsmen,
salute
you.
016:022
I
Tertius,
who
wrote
this
epistle,
salute
you
in
the
Lord.
016:023
Gaius
mine
host,
and
of
the
whole
church,
saluteth
you.
Erastus
the
chamberlain
of
the
city
saluteth
you,
and
Quartus
a
brother.
016:024
The
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
you
all.
Amen.
016:025
Now
to
him
that
is
of
power
to
stablish
you
according
to
my
gospel,
and
the
preaching
of
Jesus
Christ,
according
to
the
revelation
of
the
mystery,
which
was
kept
secret
since
the
world
began,
016:026
But
now
is
made
manifest,
and
by
the
scriptures
of
the
prophets,
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
everlasting
God,
made
known
to
all
nations
for
the
obedience
of
faith:
016:027
To
God
only
wise,
be
glory
through
Jesus
Christ
for
ever.
Amen.
Book
46	1
Corinthians
001:001
Paul
called
to
be
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ
through
the
will
of
God,
and
Sosthenes
our
brother,
001:002
Unto
the
church
of
God
which
is
at
Corinth,
to
them
that
are
sanctified
in
Christ
Jesus,
called
to
be
saints,
with
all
that
in
every
place
call
upon
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord,
both
their's
and
our's:
001:003
Grace
be
unto
you,
and
peace,
from
God
our
Father,
and
from
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
001:004
I
thank
my
God
always
on
your
behalf,
for
the
grace
of
God
which
is
given
you
by
Jesus
Christ;
001:005
That
in
every
thing
ye
are
enriched
by
him,
in
all
utterance,
and
in
all
knowledge;
001:006
Even
as
the
testimony
of
Christ
was
confirmed
in
you:
001:007
So
that
ye
come
behind
in
no
gift;
waiting
for
the
coming
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ:
001:008
Who
shall
also
confirm
you
unto
the
end,
that
ye
may
be
blameless
in
the
day
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
001:009
God
is
faithful,
by
whom
ye
were
called
unto
the
fellowship
of
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord.
001:010
Now
I
beseech
you,
brethren,
by
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
that
ye
all
speak
the
same
thing,
and
that
there
be
no
divisions
among
you;
but
that
ye
be
perfectly
joined
together
in
the
same
mind
and
in
the
same
judgment.
001:011
For
it
hath
been
declared
unto
me
of
you,
my
brethren,
by
them
which
are
of
the
house
of
Chloe,
that
there
are
contentions
among
you.
001:012
Now
this
I
say,
that
every
one
of
you
saith,
I
am
of
Paul;
and
I
of
Apollos;
and
I
of
Cephas;
and
I
of
Christ.
001:013
Is
Christ
divided?
was
Paul
crucified
for
you?
or
were
ye
baptized
in
the
name
of
Paul?
001:014
I
thank
God
that
I
baptized
none
of
you,
but
Crispus
and
Gaius;
001:015
Lest
any
should
say
that
I
had
baptized
in
mine
own
name.
001:016
And
I
baptized
also
the
household
of
Stephanas:
besides,
I
know
not
whether
I
baptized
any
other.
001:017
For
Christ
sent
me
not
to
baptize,
but
to
preach
the
gospel:
not
with
wisdom
of
words,
lest
the
cross
of
Christ
should
be
made
of
none
effect.
001:018
For
the
preaching
of
the
cross
is
to
them
that
perish
foolishness;
but
unto
us
which
are
saved
it
is
the
power
of
God.
001:019
For
it
is
written,
I
will
destroy
the
wisdom
of
the
wise,
and
will
bring
to
nothing
the
understanding
of
the
prudent.
001:020
Where
is
the
wise?
where
is
the
scribe?
where
is
the
disputer
of
this
world?
hath
not
God
made
foolish
the
wisdom
of
this
world?
001:021
For
after
that
in
the
wisdom
of
God
the
world
by
wisdom
knew
not
God,
it
pleased
God
by
the
foolishness
of
preaching
to
save
them
that
believe.
001:022
For
the
Jews
require
a
sign,
and
the
Greeks
seek
after
wisdom:
001:023
But
we
preach
Christ
crucified,
unto
the
Jews
a
stumblingblock,
and
unto
the
Greeks
foolishness;
001:024
But
unto
them
which
are
called,
both
Jews
and
Greeks,
Christ
the
power
of
God,
and
the
wisdom
of
God.
001:025
Because
the
foolishness
of
God
is
wiser
than
men;
and
the
weakness
of
God
is
stronger
than
men.
001:026
For
ye
see
your
calling,
brethren,
how
that
not
many
wise
men
after
the
flesh,
not
many
mighty,
not
many
noble,
are
called:
001:027
But
God
hath
chosen
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
wise;
and
God
hath
chosen
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
things
which
are
mighty;
001:028
And
base
things
of
the
world,
and
things
which
are
despised,
hath
God
chosen,
yea,
and
things
which
are
not,
to
bring
to
nought
things
that
are:
001:029
That
no
flesh
should
glory
in
his
presence.
001:030
But
of
him
are
ye
in
Christ
Jesus,
who
of
God
is
made
unto
us
wisdom,
and
righteousness,
and
sanctification,
and
redemption:
001:031
That,
according
as
it
is
written,
He
that
glorieth,
let
him
glory
in
the
Lord.
002:001
And
I,
brethren,
when
I
came
to
you,
came
not
with
excellency
of
speech
or
of
wisdom,
declaring
unto
you
the
testimony
of
God.
002:002
For
I
determined
not
to
know
any
thing
among
you,
save
Jesus
Christ,
and
him
crucified.
002:003
And
I
was
with
you
in
weakness,
and
in
fear,
and
in
much
trembling.
002:004
And
my
speech
and
my
preaching
was
not
with
enticing
words
of
man's
wisdom,
but
in
demonstration
of
the
Spirit
and
of
power:
002:005
That
your
faith
should
not
stand
in
the
wisdom
of
men,
but
in
the
power
of
God.
002:006
Howbeit
we
speak
wisdom
among
them
that
are
perfect:
yet
not
the
wisdom
of
this
world,
nor
of
the
princes
of
this
world,
that
come
to
nought:
002:007
But
we
speak
the
wisdom
of
God
in
a
mystery,
even
the
hidden
wisdom,
which
God
ordained
before
the
world
unto
our
glory:
002:008
Which
none
of
the
princes
of
this
world
knew:
for
had
they
known
it,
they
would
not
have
crucified
the
Lord
of
glory.
002:009
But
as
it
is
written,
Eye
hath
not
seen,
nor
ear
heard,
neither
have
entered
into
the
heart
of
man,
the
things
which
God
hath
prepared
for
them
that
love
him.
002:010
But
God
hath
revealed
them
unto
us
by
his
Spirit:
for
the
Spirit
searcheth
all
things,
yea,
the
deep
things
of
God.
002:011
For
what
man
knoweth
the
things
of
a
man,
save
the
spirit
of
man
which
is
in
him?
even
so
the
things
of
God
knoweth
no
man,
but
the
Spirit
of
God.
002:012
Now
we
have
received,
not
the
spirit
of
the
world,
but
the
spirit
which
is
of
God;
that
we
might
know
the
things
that
are
freely
given
to
us
of
God.
002:013
Which
things
also
we
speak,
not
in
the
words
which
man's
wisdom
teacheth,
but
which
the
Holy
Ghost
teacheth;
comparing
spiritual
things
with
spiritual.
002:014
But
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
Spirit
of
God:
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
him:
neither
can
he
know
them,
because
they
are
spiritually
discerned.
002:015
But
he
that
is
spiritual
judgeth
all
things,
yet
he
himself
is
judged
of
no
man.
002:016
For
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
Lord,
that
he
may
instruct
him?
But
we
have
the
mind
of
Christ.
003:001
And
I,
brethren,
could
not
speak
unto
you
as
unto
spiritual,
but
as
unto
carnal,
even
as
unto
babes
in
Christ.
003:002
I
have
fed
you
with
milk,
and
not
with
meat:
for
hitherto
ye
were
not
able
to
bear
it,
neither
yet
now
are
ye
able.
003:003
For
ye
are
yet
carnal:
for
whereas
there
is
among
you
envying,
and
strife,
and
divisions,
are
ye
not
carnal,
and
walk
as
men?
003:004
For
while
one
saith,
I
am
of
Paul;
and
another,
I
am
of
Apollos;
are
ye
not
carnal?
003:005
Who
then
is
Paul,
and
who
is
Apollos,
but
ministers
by
whom
ye
believed,
even
as
the
Lord
gave
to
every
man?
003:006
I
have
planted,
Apollos
watered;
but
God
gave
the
increase.
003:007
So
then
neither
is
he
that
planteth
any
thing,
neither
he
that
watereth;
but
God
that
giveth
the
increase.
003:008
Now
he
that
planteth
and
he
that
watereth
are
one:
and
every
man
shall
receive
his
own
reward
according
to
his
own
labour.
003:009
For
we
are
labourers
together
with
God:
ye
are
God's
husbandry,
ye
are
God's
building.
003:010
According
to
the
grace
of
God
which
is
given
unto
me,
as
a
wise
masterbuilder,
I
have
laid
the
foundation,
and
another
buildeth
thereon.
But
let
every
man
take
heed
how
he
buildeth
thereupon.
003:011
For
other
foundation
can
no
man
lay
than
that
is
laid,
which
is
Jesus
Christ.
003:012
Now
if
any
man
build
upon
this
foundation
gold,
silver,
precious
stones,
wood,
hay,
stubble;
003:013
Every
man's
work
shall
be
made
manifest:
for
the
day
shall
declare
it,
because
it
shall
be
revealed
by
fire;
and
the
fire
shall
try
every
man's
work
of
what
sort
it
is.
003:014
If
any
man's
work
abide
which
he
hath
built
thereupon,
he
shall
receive
a
reward.
003:015
If
any
man's
work
shall
be
burned,
he
shall
suffer
loss:
but
he
himself
shall
be
saved;
yet
so
as
by
fire.
003:016
Know
ye
not
that
ye
are
the
temple
of
God,
and
that
the
Spirit
of
God
dwelleth
in
you?
003:017
If
any
man
defile
the
temple
of
God,
him
shall
God
destroy;
for
the
temple
of
God
is
holy,
which
temple
ye
are.
003:018
Let
no
man
deceive
himself.
If
any
man
among
you
seemeth
to
be
wise
in
this
world,
let
him
become
a
fool,
that
he
may
be
wise.
003:019
For
the
wisdom
of
this
world
is
foolishness
with
God.
For
it
is
written,
He
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness.
003:020
And
again,
The
Lord
knoweth
the
thoughts
of
the
wise,
that
they
are
vain.
003:021
Therefore
let
no
man
glory
in
men.
For
all
things
are
your's;
003:022
Whether
Paul,
or
Apollos,
or
Cephas,
or
the
world,
or
life,
or
death,
or
things
present,
or
things
to
come;
all
are
your's;
003:023
And
ye
are
Christ's;
and
Christ
is
God's.
004:001
Let
a
man
so
account
of
us,
as
of
the
ministers
of
Christ,
and
stewards
of
the
mysteries
of
God.
004:002
Moreover
it
is
required
in
stewards,
that
a
man
be
found
faithful.
004:003
But
with
me
it
is
a
very
small
thing
that
I
should
be
judged
of
you,
or
of
man's
judgment:
yea,
I
judge
not
mine
own
self.
004:004
For
I
know
nothing
by
myself;
yet
am
I
not
hereby
justified:
but
he
that
judgeth
me
is
the
Lord.
004:005
Therefore
judge
nothing
before
the
time,
until
the
Lord
come,
who
both
will
bring
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
darkness,
and
will
make
manifest
the
counsels
of
the
hearts:
and
then
shall
every
man
have
praise
of
God.
004:006
And
these
things,
brethren,
I
have
in
a
figure
transferred
to
myself
and
to
Apollos
for
your
sakes;
that
ye
might
learn
in
us
not
to
think
of
men
above
that
which
is
written,
that
no
one
of
you
be
puffed
up
for
one
against
another.
004:007
For
who
maketh
thee
to
differ
from
another?
and
what
hast
thou
that
thou
didst
not
receive?
now
if
thou
didst
receive
it,
why
dost
thou
glory,
as
if
thou
hadst
not
received
it?
004:008
Now
ye
are
full,
now
ye
are
rich,
ye
have
reigned
as
kings
without
us:
and
I
would
to
God
ye
did
reign,
that
we
also
might
reign
with
you.
004:009
For
I
think
that
God
hath
set
forth
us
the
apostles
last,
as
it
were
appointed
to
death:
for
we
are
made
a
spectacle
unto
the
world,
and
to
angels,
and
to
men.
004:010
We
are
fools
for
Christ's
sake,
but
ye
are
wise
in
Christ;
we
are
weak,
but
ye
are
strong;
ye
are
honourable,
but
we
are
despised.
004:011
Even
unto
this
present
hour
we
both
hunger,
and
thirst,
and
are
naked,
and
are
buffeted,
and
have
no
certain
dwellingplace;
004:012
And
labour,
working
with
our
own
hands:
being
reviled,
we
bless;
being
persecuted,
we
suffer
it:
004:013
Being
defamed,
we
intreat:
we
are
made
as
the
filth
of
the
world,
and
are
the
offscouring
of
all
things
unto
this
day.
004:014
I
write
not
these
things
to
shame
you,
but
as
my
beloved
sons
I
warn
you.
004:015
For
though
ye
have
ten
thousand
instructers
in
Christ,
yet
have
ye
not
many
fathers:
for
in
Christ
Jesus
I
have
begotten
you
through
the
gospel.
004:016
Wherefore
I
beseech
you,
be
ye
followers
of
me.
004:017
For
this
cause
have
I
sent
unto
you
Timotheus,
who
is
my
beloved
son,
and
faithful
in
the
Lord,
who
shall
bring
you
into
remembrance
of
my
ways
which
be
in
Christ,
as
I
teach
every
where
in
every
church.
004:018
Now
some
are
puffed
up,
as
though
I
would
not
come
to
you.
004:019
But
I
will
come
to
you
shortly,
if
the
Lord
will,
and
will
know,
not
the
speech
of
them
which
are
puffed
up,
but
the
power.
004:020
For
the
kingdom
of
God
is
not
in
word,
but
in
power.
004:021
What
will
ye?
shall
I
come
unto
you
with
a
rod,
or
in
love,
and
in
the
spirit
of
meekness?
005:001
It
is
reported
commonly
that
there
is
fornication
among
you,
and
such
fornication
as
is
not
so
much
as
named
among
the
Gentiles,
that
one
should
have
his
father's
wife.
005:002
And
ye
are
puffed
up,
and
have
not
rather
mourned,
that
he
that
hath
done
this
deed
might
be
taken
away
from
among
you.
005:003
For
I
verily,
as
absent
in
body,
but
present
in
spirit,
have
judged
already,
as
though
I
were
present,
concerning
him
that
hath
so
done
this
deed,
005:004
In
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
when
ye
are
gathered
together,
and
my
spirit,
with
the
power
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
005:005
To
deliver
such
an
one
unto
Satan
for
the
destruction
of
the
flesh,
that
the
spirit
may
be
saved
in
the
day
of
the
Lord
Jesus.
005:006
Your
glorying
is
not
good.
Know
ye
not
that
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump?
005:007
Purge
out
therefore
the
old
leaven,
that
ye
may
be
a
new
lump,
as
ye
are
unleavened.
For
even
Christ
our
passover
is
sacrificed
for
us:
005:008
Therefore
let
us
keep
the
feast,
not
with
old
leaven,
neither
with
the
leaven
of
malice
and
wickedness;
but
with
the
unleavened
bread
of
sincerity
and
truth.
005:009
I
wrote
unto
you
in
an
