epistle
not
to
company
with
fornicators:
005:010
Yet
not
altogether
with
the
fornicators
of
this
world,
or
with
the
covetous,
or
extortioners,
or
with
idolaters;
for
then
must
ye
needs
go
out
of
the
world.
005:011
But
now
I
have
written
unto
you
not
to
keep
company,
if
any
man
that
is
called
a
brother
be
a
fornicator,
or
covetous,
or
an
idolater,
or
a
railer,
or
a
drunkard,
or
an
extortioner;
with
such
an
one
no
not
to
eat.
005:012
For
what
have
I
to
do
to
judge
them
also
that
are
without?
do
not
ye
judge
them
that
are
within?
005:013
But
them
that
are
without
God
judgeth.
Therefore
put
away
from
among
yourselves
that
wicked
person.
006:001
Dare
any
of
you,
having
a
matter
against
another,
go
to
law
before
the
unjust,
and
not
before
the
saints?
006:002
Do
ye
not
know
that
the
saints
shall
judge
the
world?
and
if
the
world
shall
be
judged
by
you,
are
ye
unworthy
to
judge
the
smallest
matters?
006:003
Know
ye
not
that
we
shall
judge
angels?
how
much
more
things
that
pertain
to
this
life?
006:004
If
then
ye
have
judgments
of
things
pertaining
to
this
life,
set
them
to
judge
who
are
least
esteemed
in
the
church.
006:005
I
speak
to
your
shame.
Is
it
so,
that
there
is
not
a
wise
man
among
you?
no,
not
one
that
shall
be
able
to
judge
between
his
brethren?
006:006
But
brother
goeth
to
law
with
brother,
and
that
before
the
unbelievers.
006:007
Now
therefore
there
is
utterly
a
fault
among
you,
because
ye
go
to
law
one
with
another.
Why
do
ye
not
rather
take
wrong?
why
do
ye
not
rather
suffer
yourselves
to
be
defrauded?
006:008
Nay,
ye
do
wrong,
and
defraud,
and
that
your
brethren.
006:009
Know
ye
not
that
the
unrighteous
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God?
Be
not
deceived:
neither
fornicators,
nor
idolaters,
nor
adulterers,
nor
effeminate,
nor
abusers
of
themselves
with
mankind,
006:010
Nor
thieves,
nor
covetous,
nor
drunkards,
nor
revilers,
nor
extortioners,
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God.
006:011
And
such
were
some
of
you:
but
ye
are
washed,
but
ye
are
sanctified,
but
ye
are
justified
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus,
and
by
the
Spirit
of
our
God.
006:012
All
things
are
lawful
unto
me,
but
all
things
are
not
expedient:
all
things
are
lawful
for
me,
but
I
will
not
be
brought
under
the
power
of
any.
006:013
Meats
for
the
belly,
and
the
belly
for
meats:
but
God
shall
destroy
both
it
and
them.
Now
the
body
is
not
for
fornication,
but
for
the
Lord;
and
the
Lord
for
the
body.
006:014
And
God
hath
both
raised
up
the
Lord,
and
will
also
raise
up
us
by
his
own
power.
006:015
Know
ye
not
that
your
bodies
are
the
members
of
Christ?
shall
I
then
take
the
members
of
Christ,
and
make
them
the
members
of
an
harlot?
God
forbid.
006:016
What?
know
ye
not
that
he
which
is
joined
to
an
harlot
is
one
body?
for
two,
saith
he,
shall
be
one
flesh.
006:017
But
he
that
is
joined
unto
the
Lord
is
one
spirit.
006:018
Flee
fornication.
Every
sin
that
a
man
doeth
is
without
the
body;
but
he
that
committeth
fornication
sinneth
against
his
own
body.
006:019
What?
know
ye
not
that
your
body
is
the
temple
of
the
Holy
Ghost
which
is
in
you,
which
ye
have
of
God,
and
ye
are
not
your
own?
006:020
For
ye
are
bought
with
a
price:
therefore
glorify
God
in
your
body,
and
in
your
spirit,
which
are
God's.
007:001
Now
concerning
the
things
whereof
ye
wrote
unto
me:
It
is
good
for
a
man
not
to
touch
a
woman.
007:002
Nevertheless,
to
avoid
fornication,
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife,
and
let
every
woman
have
her
own
husband.
007:003
Let
the
husband
render
unto
the
wife
due
benevolence:
and
likewise
also
the
wife
unto
the
husband.
007:004
The
wife
hath
not
power
of
her
own
body,
but
the
husband:
and
likewise
also
the
husband
hath
not
power
of
his
own
body,
but
the
wife.
007:005
Defraud
ye
not
one
the
other,
except
it
be
with
consent
for
a
time,
that
ye
may
give
yourselves
to
fasting
and
prayer;
and
come
together
again,
that
Satan
tempt
you
not
for
your
incontinency.
007:006
But
I
speak
this
by
permission,
and
not
of
commandment.
007:007
For
I
would
that
all
men
were
even
as
I
myself.
But
every
man
hath
his
proper
gift
of
God,
one
after
this
manner,
and
another
after
that.
007:008
I
say
therefore
to
the
unmarried
and
widows,
It
is
good
for
them
if
they
abide
even
as
I.
007:009
But
if
they
cannot
contain,
let
them
marry:
for
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
burn.
007:010
And
unto
the
married
I
command,
yet
not
I,
but
the
Lord,
Let
not
the
wife
depart
from
her
husband:
007:011
But
and
if
she
depart,
let
her
remain
unmarried
or
be
reconciled
to
her
husband:
and
let
not
the
husband
put
away
his
wife.
007:012
But
to
the
rest
speak
I,
not
the
Lord:
If
any
brother
hath
a
wife
that
believeth
not,
and
she
be
pleased
to
dwell
with
him,
let
him
not
put
her
away.
007:013
And
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
that
believeth
not,
and
if
he
be
pleased
to
dwell
with
her,
let
her
not
leave
him.
007:014
For
the
unbelieving
husband
is
sanctified
by
the
wife,
and
the
unbelieving
wife
is
sanctified
by
the
husband:
else
were
your
children
unclean;
but
now
are
they
holy.
007:015
But
if
the
unbelieving
depart,
let
him
depart.
A
brother
or
a
sister
is
not
under
bondage
in
such
cases:
but
God
hath
called
us
to
peace.
007:016
For
what
knowest
thou,
O
wife,
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
husband?
or
how
knowest
thou,
O
man,
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
wife?
007:017
But
as
God
hath
distributed
to
every
man,
as
the
Lord
hath
called
every
one,
so
let
him
walk.
And
so
ordain
I
in
all
churches.
007:018
Is
any
man
called
being
circumcised?
let
him
not
become
uncircumcised.
Is
any
called
in
uncircumcision?
let
him
not
be
circumcised.
007:019
Circumcision
is
nothing,
and
uncircumcision
is
nothing,
but
the
keeping
of
the
commandments
of
God.
007:020
Let
every
man
abide
in
the
same
calling
wherein
he
was
called.
007:021
Art
thou
called
being
a
servant?
care
not
for
it:
but
if
thou
mayest
be
made
free,
use
it
rather.
007:022
For
he
that
is
called
in
the
Lord,
being
a
servant,
is
the
Lord's
freeman:
likewise
also
he
that
is
called,
being
free,
is
Christ's
servant.
007:023
Ye
are
bought
with
a
price;
be
not
ye
the
servants
of
men.
007:024
Brethren,
let
every
man,
wherein
he
is
called,
therein
abide
with
God.
007:025
Now
concerning
virgins
I
have
no
commandment
of
the
Lord:
yet
I
give
my
judgment,
as
one
that
hath
obtained
mercy
of
the
Lord
to
be
faithful.
007:026
I
suppose
therefore
that
this
is
good
for
the
present
distress,
I
say,
that
it
is
good
for
a
man
so
to
be.
007:027
Art
thou
bound
unto
a
wife?
seek
not
to
be
loosed.
Art
thou
loosed
from
a
wife?
seek
not
a
wife.
007:028
But
and
if
thou
marry,
thou
hast
not
sinned;
and
if
a
virgin
marry,
she
hath
not
sinned.
Nevertheless
such
shall
have
trouble
in
the
flesh:
but
I
spare
you.
007:029
But
this
I
say,
brethren,
the
time
is
short:
it
remaineth,
that
both
they
that
have
wives
be
as
though
they
had
none;
007:030
And
they
that
weep,
as
though
they
wept
not;
and
they
that
rejoice,
as
though
they
rejoiced
not;
and
they
that
buy,
as
though
they
possessed
not;
007:031
And
they
that
use
this
world,
as
not
abusing
it:
for
the
fashion
of
this
world
passeth
away.
007:032
But
I
would
have
you
without
carefulness.
He
that
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
Lord,
how
he
may
please
the
Lord:
007:033
But
he
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
that
are
of
the
world,
how
he
may
please
his
wife.
007:034
There
is
difference
also
between
a
wife
and
a
virgin.
The
unmarried
woman
careth
for
the
things
of
the
Lord,
that
she
may
be
holy
both
in
body
and
in
spirit:
but
she
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
of
the
world,
how
she
may
please
her
husband.
007:035
And
this
I
speak
for
your
own
profit;
not
that
I
may
cast
a
snare
upon
you,
but
for
that
which
is
comely,
and
that
ye
may
attend
upon
the
Lord
without
distraction.
007:036
But
if
any
man
think
that
he
behaveth
himself
uncomely
toward
his
virgin,
if
she
pass
the
flower
of
her
age,
and
need
so
require,
let
him
do
what
he
will,
he
sinneth
not:
let
them
marry.
007:037
Nevertheless
he
that
standeth
stedfast
in
his
heart,
having
no
necessity,
but
hath
power
over
his
own
will,
and
hath
so
decreed
in
his
heart
that
he
will
keep
his
virgin,
doeth
well.
007:038
So
then
he
that
giveth
her
in
marriage
doeth
well;
but
he
that
giveth
her
not
in
marriage
doeth
better.
007:039
The
wife
is
bound
by
the
law
as
long
as
her
husband
liveth;
but
if
her
husband
be
dead,
she
is
at
liberty
to
be
married
to
whom
she
will;
only
in
the
Lord.
007:040
But
she
is
happier
if
she
so
abide,
after
my
judgment:
and
I
think
also
that
I
have
the
Spirit
of
God.
008:001
Now
as
touching
things
offered
unto
idols,
we
know
that
we
all
have
knowledge.
Knowledge
puffeth
up,
but
charity
edifieth.
008:002
And
if
any
man
think
that
he
knoweth
any
thing,
he
knoweth
nothing
yet
as
he
ought
to
know.
008:003
But
if
any
man
love
God,
the
same
is
known
of
him.
008:004
As
concerning
therefore
the
eating
of
those
things
that
are
offered
in
sacrifice
unto
idols,
we
know
that
an
idol
is
nothing
in
the
world,
and
that
there
is
none
other
God
but
one.
008:005
For
though
there
be
that
are
called
gods,
whether
in
heaven
or
in
earth,
(as
there
be
gods
many,
and
lords
many,)
008:006
But
to
us
there
is
but
one
God,
the
Father,
of
whom
are
all
things,
and
we
in
him;
and
one
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
by
whom
are
all
things,
and
we
by
him.
008:007
Howbeit
there
is
not
in
every
man
that
knowledge:
for
some
with
conscience
of
the
idol
unto
this
hour
eat
it
as
a
thing
offered
unto
an
idol;
and
their
conscience
being
weak
is
defiled.
008:008
But
meat
commendeth
us
not
to
God:
for
neither,
if
we
eat,
are
we
the
better;
neither,
if
we
eat
not,
are
we
the
worse.
008:009
But
take
heed
lest
by
any
means
this
liberty
of
your's
become
a
stumblingblock
to
them
that
are
weak.
008:010
For
if
any
man
see
thee
which
hast
knowledge
sit
at
meat
in
the
idol's
temple,
shall
not
the
conscience
of
him
which
is
weak
be
emboldened
to
eat
those
things
which
are
offered
to
idols;
008:011
And
through
thy
knowledge
shall
the
weak
brother
perish,
for
whom
Christ
died?
008:012
But
when
ye
sin
so
against
the
brethren,
and
wound
their
weak
conscience,
ye
sin
against
Christ.
008:013
Wherefore,
if
meat
make
my
brother
to
offend,
I
will
eat
no
flesh
while
the
world
standeth,
lest
I
make
my
brother
to
offend.
009:001
Am
I
not
an
apostle?
am
I
not
free?
have
I
not
seen
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord?
are
not
ye
my
work
in
the
Lord?
009:002
If
I
be
not
an
apostle
unto
others,
yet
doubtless
I
am
to
you:
for
the
seal
of
mine
apostleship
are
ye
in
the
Lord.
009:003
Mine
answer
to
them
that
do
examine
me
is
this,
009:004
Have
we
not
power
to
eat
and
to
drink?
009:005
Have
we
not
power
to
lead
about
a
sister,
a
wife,
as
well
as
other
apostles,
and
as
the
brethren
of
the
Lord,
and
Cephas?
009:006
Or
I
only
and
Barnabas,
have
not
we
power
to
forbear
working?
009:007
Who
goeth
a
warfare
any
time
at
his
own
charges?
who
planteth
a
vineyard,
and
eateth
not
of
the
fruit
thereof?
or
who
feedeth
a
flock,
and
eateth
not
of
the
milk
of
the
flock?
009:008
Say
I
these
things
as
a
man?
or
saith
not
the
law
the
same
also?
009:009
For
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
Moses,
Thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
mouth
of
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn.
Doth
God
take
care
for
oxen?
009:010
Or
saith
he
it
altogether
for
our
sakes?
For
our
sakes,
no
doubt,
this
is
written:
that
he
that
ploweth
should
plow
in
hope;
and
that
he
that
thresheth
in
hope
should
be
partaker
of
his
hope.
009:011
If
we
have
sown
unto
you
spiritual
things,
is
it
a
great
thing
if
we
shall
reap
your
carnal
things?
009:012
If
others
be
partakers
of
this
power
over
you,
are
not
we
rather?
Nevertheless
we
have
not
used
this
power;
but
suffer
all
things,
lest
we
should
hinder
the
gospel
of
Christ.
009:013
Do
ye
not
know
that
they
which
minister
about
holy
things
live
of
the
things
of
the
temple?
and
they
which
wait
at
the
altar
are
partakers
with
the
altar?
009:014
Even
so
hath
the
Lord
ordained
that
they
which
preach
the
gospel
should
live
of
the
gospel.
009:015
But
I
have
used
none
of
these
things:
neither
have
I
written
these
things,
that
it
should
be
so
done
unto
me:
for
it
were
better
for
me
to
die,
than
that
any
man
should
make
my
glorying
void.
009:016
For
though
I
preach
the
gospel,
I
have
nothing
to
glory
of:
for
necessity
is
laid
upon
me;
yea,
woe
is
unto
me,
if
I
preach
not
the
gospel!
009:017
For
if
I
do
this
thing
willingly,
I
have
a
reward:
but
if
against
my
will,
a
dispensation
of
the
gospel
is
committed
unto
me.
009:018
What
is
my
reward
then?
Verily
that,
when
I
preach
the
gospel,
I
may
make
the
gospel
of
Christ
without
charge,
that
I
abuse
not
my
power
in
the
gospel.
009:019
For
though
I
be
free
from
all
men,
yet
have
I
made
myself
servant
unto
all,
that
I
might
gain
the
more.
009:020
And
unto
the
Jews
I
became
as
a
Jew,
that
I
might
gain
the
Jews;
to
them
that
are
under
the
law,
as
under
the
law,
that
I
might
gain
them
that
are
under
the
law;
009:021
To
them
that
are
without
law,
as
without
law,
(being
not
without
law
to
God,
but
under
the
law
to
Christ,)
that
I
might
gain
them
that
are
without
law.
009:022
To
the
weak
became
I
as
weak,
that
I
might
gain
the
weak:
I
am
made
all
things
to
all
men,
that
I
might
by
all
means
save
some.
009:023
And
this
I
do
for
the
gospel's
sake,
that
I
might
be
partaker
thereof
with
you.
009:024
Know
ye
not
that
they
which
run
in
a
race
run
all,
but
one
receiveth
the
prize?
So
run,
that
ye
may
obtain.
009:025
And
every
man
that
striveth
for
the
mastery
is
temperate
in
all
things.
Now
they
do
it
to
obtain
a
corruptible
crown;
but
we
an
incorruptible.
009:026
I
therefore
so
run,
not
as
uncertainly;
so
fight
I,
not
as
one
that
beateth
the
air:
009:027
But
I
keep
under
my
body,
and
bring
it
into
subjection:
lest
that
by
any
means,
when
I
have
preached
to
others,
I
myself
should
be
a
castaway.
010:001
Moreover,
brethren,
I
would
not
that
ye
should
be
ignorant,
how
that
all
our
fathers
were
under
the
cloud,
and
all
passed
through
the
sea;
010:002
And
were
all
baptized
unto
Moses
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea;
010:003
And
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
meat;
010:004
And
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
drink:
for
they
drank
of
that
spiritual
Rock
that
followed
them:
and
that
Rock
was
Christ.
010:005
But
with
many
of
them
God
was
not
well
pleased:
for
they
were
overthrown
in
the
wilderness.
010:006
Now
these
things
were
our
examples,
to
the
intent
we
should
not
lust
after
evil
things,
as
they
also
lusted.
010:007
Neither
be
ye
idolaters,
as
were
some
of
them;
as
it
is
written,
The
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink,
and
rose
up
to
play.
010:008
Neither
let
us
commit
fornication,
as
some
of
them
committed,
and
fell
in
one
day
three
and
twenty
thousand.
010:009
Neither
let
us
tempt
Christ,
as
some
of
them
also
tempted,
and
were
destroyed
of
serpents.
010:010
Neither
murmur
ye,
as
some
of
them
also
murmured,
and
were
destroyed
of
the
destroyer.
010:011
Now
all
these
things
happened
unto
them
for
ensamples:
and
they
are
written
for
our
admonition,
upon
whom
the
ends
of
the
world
are
come.
010:012
Wherefore
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall.
010:013
There
hath
no
temptation
taken
you
but
such
as
is
common
to
man:
but
God
is
faithful,
who
will
not
suffer
you
to
be
tempted
above
that
ye
are
able;
but
will
with
the
temptation
also
make
a
way
to
escape,
that
ye
may
be
able
to
bear
it.
010:014
Wherefore,
my
dearly
beloved,
flee
from
idolatry.
010:015
I
speak
as
to
wise
men;
judge
ye
what
I
say.
010:016
The
cup
of
blessing
which
we
bless,
is
it
not
the
communion
of
the
blood
of
Christ?
The
bread
which
we
break,
is
it
not
the
communion
of
the
body
of
Christ?
010:017
For
we
being
many
are
one
bread,
and
one
body:
for
we
are
all
partakers
of
that
one
bread.
010:018
Behold
Israel
after
the
flesh:
are
not
they
which
eat
of
the
sacrifices
partakers
of
the
altar?
010:019
What
say
I
then?
that
the
idol
is
any
thing,
or
that
which
is
offered
in
sacrifice
to
idols
is
any
thing?
010:020
But
I
say,
that
the
things
which
the
Gentiles
sacrifice,
they
sacrifice
to
devils,
and
not
to
God:
and
I
would
not
that
ye
should
have
fellowship
with
devils.
010:021
Ye
cannot
drink
the
cup
of
the
Lord,
and
the
cup
of
devils:
ye
cannot
be
partakers
of
the
Lord's
table,
and
of
the
table
of
devils.
010:022
Do
we
provoke
the
Lord
to
jealousy?
are
we
stronger
than
he?
010:023
All
things
are
lawful
for
me,
but
all
things
are
not
expedient:
all
things
are
lawful
for
me,
but
all
things
edify
not.
010:024
Let
no
man
seek
his
own,
but
every
man
another's
wealth.
010:025
Whatsoever
is
sold
in
the
shambles,
that
eat,
asking
no
question
for
conscience
sake:
010:026
For
the
earth
is
the
Lord's,
and
the
fulness
thereof.
010:027
If
any
of
them
that
believe
not
bid
you
to
a
feast,
and
ye
be
disposed
to
go;
whatsoever
is
set
before
you,
eat,
asking
no
question
for
conscience
sake.
010:028
But
if
any
man
say
unto
you,
This
is
offered
in
sacrifice
unto
idols,
eat
not
for
his
sake
that
shewed
it,
and
for
conscience
sake:
for
the
earth
is
the
Lord's,
and
the
fulness
thereof:
010:029
Conscience,
I
say,
not
thine
own,
but
of
the
other:
for
why
is
my
liberty
judged
of
another
man's
conscience?
010:030
For
if
I
by
grace
be
a
partaker,
why
am
I
evil
spoken
of
for
that
for
which
I
give
thanks?
010:031
Whether
therefore
ye
eat,
or
drink,
or
whatsoever
ye
do,
do
all
to
the
glory
of
God.
010:032
Give
none
offence,
neither
to
the
Jews,
nor
to
the
Gentiles,
nor
to
the
church
of
God:
010:033
Even
as
I
please
all
men
in
all
things,
not
seeking
mine
own
profit,
but
the
profit
of
many,
that
they
may
be
saved.
011:001
Be
ye
followers
of
me,
even
as
I
also
am
of
Christ.
011:002
Now
I
praise
you,
brethren,
that
ye
remember
me
in
all
things,
and
keep
the
ordinances,
as
I
delivered
them
to
you.
011:003
But
I
would
have
you
know,
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
Christ;
and
the
head
of
the
woman
is
the
man;
and
the
head
of
Christ
is
God.
011:004
Every
man
praying
or
prophesying,
having
his
head
covered,
dishonoureth
his
head.
011:005
But
every
woman
that
prayeth
or
prophesieth
with
her
head
uncovered
dishonoureth
her
head:
for
that
is
even
all
one
as
if
she
were
shaven.
011:006
For
if
the
woman
be
not
covered,
let
her
also
be
shorn:
but
if
it
be
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
be
shorn
or
shaven,
let
her
be
covered.
011:007
For
a
man
indeed
ought
not
to
cover
his
head,
forasmuch
as
he
is
the
image
and
glory
of
God:
but
the
woman
is
the
glory
of
the
man.
011:008
For
the
man
is
not
of
the
woman:
but
the
woman
of
the
man.
011:009
Neither
was
the
man
created
for
the
woman;
but
the
woman
for
the
man.
011:010
For
this
cause
ought
the
woman
to
have
power
on
her
head
because
of
the
angels.
011:011
Nevertheless
neither
is
the
man
without
the
woman,
neither
the
woman
without
the
man,
in
the
Lord.
011:012
For
as
the
woman
is
of
the
man,
even
so
is
the
man
also
by
the
woman;
but
all
things
of
God.
011:013
Judge
in
yourselves:
is
it
comely
that
a
woman
pray
unto
God
uncovered?
011:014
Doth
not
even
nature
itself
teach
you,
that,
if
a
man
have
long
hair,
it
is
a
shame
unto
him?
011:015
But
if
a
woman
have
long
hair,
it
is
a
glory
to
her:
for
her
hair
is
given
her
for
a
covering.
011:016
But
if
any
man
seem
to
be
contentious,
we
have
no
such
custom,
neither
the
churches
of
God.
011:017
Now
in
this
that
I
declare
unto
you
I
praise
you
not,
that
ye
come
together
not
for
the
better,
but
for
the
worse.
011:018
For
first
of
all,
when
ye
come
together
in
the
church,
I
hear
that
there
be
divisions
among
you;
and
I
partly
believe
it.
011:019
For
there
must
be
also
heresies
among
you,
that
they
which
are
approved
may
be
made
manifest
among
you.
011:020
When
ye
come
together
therefore
into
one
place,
this
is
not
to
eat
the
Lord's
supper.
011:021
For
in
eating
every
one
taketh
before
other
his
own
supper:
and
one
is
hungry,
and
another
is
drunken.
011:022
What?
have
ye
not
houses
to
eat
and
to
drink
in?
or
despise
ye
the
church
of
God,
and
shame
them
that
have
not?
What
shall
I
say
to
you?
shall
I
praise
you
in
this?
I
praise
you
not.
011:023
For
I
have
received
of
the
Lord
that
which
also
I
delivered
unto
you,
That
the
Lord
Jesus
the
same
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
took
bread:
011:024
And
when
he
had
given
thanks,
he
brake
it,
and
said,
Take,
eat:
this
is
my
body,
which
is
broken
for
you:
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me.
011:025
After
the
same
manner
also
he
took
the
cup,
when
he
had
supped,
saying,
This
cup
is
the
new
testament
in
my
blood:
this
do
ye,
as
oft
as
ye
drink
it,
in
remembrance
of
me.
011:026
For
as
often
as
ye
eat
this
bread,
and
drink
this
cup,
ye
do
shew
the
Lord's
death
till
he
come.
011:027
Wherefore
whosoever
shall
eat
this
bread,
and
drink
this
cup
of
the
Lord,
unworthily,
shall
be
guilty
of
the
body
and
blood
of
the
Lord.
011:028
But
let
a
man
examine
himself,
and
so
let
him
eat
of
that
bread,
and
drink
of
that
cup.
011:029
For
he
that
eateth
and
drinketh
unworthily,
eateth
and
drinketh
damnation
to
himself,
not
discerning
the
Lord's
body.
011:030
For
this
cause
many
are
weak
and
sickly
among
you,
and
many
sleep.
011:031
For
if
we
would
judge
ourselves,
we
should
not
be
judged.
011:032
But
when
we
are
judged,
we
are
chastened
of
the
Lord,
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
with
the
world.
011:033
Wherefore,
my
brethren,
when
ye
come
together
to
eat,
tarry
one
for
another.
011:034
And
if
any
man
hunger,
let
him
eat
at
home;
that
ye
come
not
together
unto
condemnation.
And
the
rest
will
I
set
in
order
when
I
come.
012:001
Now
concerning
spiritual
gifts,
brethren,
I
would
not
have
you
ignorant.
012:002
Ye
know
that
ye
were
Gentiles,
carried
away
