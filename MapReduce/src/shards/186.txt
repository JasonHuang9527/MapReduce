unto
these
dumb
idols,
even
as
ye
were
led.
012:003
Wherefore
I
give
you
to
understand,
that
no
man
speaking
by
the
Spirit
of
God
calleth
Jesus
accursed:
and
that
no
man
can
say
that
Jesus
is
the
Lord,
but
by
the
Holy
Ghost.
012:004
Now
there
are
diversities
of
gifts,
but
the
same
Spirit.
012:005
And
there
are
differences
of
administrations,
but
the
same
Lord.
012:006
And
there
are
diversities
of
operations,
but
it
is
the
same
God
which
worketh
all
in
all.
012:007
But
the
manifestation
of
the
Spirit
is
given
to
every
man
to
profit
withal.
012:008
For
to
one
is
given
by
the
Spirit
the
word
of
wisdom;
to
another
the
word
of
knowledge
by
the
same
Spirit;
012:009
To
another
faith
by
the
same
Spirit;
to
another
the
gifts
of
healing
by
the
same
Spirit;
012:010
To
another
the
working
of
miracles;
to
another
prophecy;
to
another
discerning
of
spirits;
to
another
divers
kinds
of
tongues;
to
another
the
interpretation
of
tongues:
012:011
But
all
these
worketh
that
one
and
the
selfsame
Spirit,
dividing
to
every
man
severally
as
he
will.
012:012
For
as
the
body
is
one,
and
hath
many
members,
and
all
the
members
of
that
one
body,
being
many,
are
one
body:
so
also
is
Christ.
012:013
For
by
one
Spirit
are
we
all
baptized
into
one
body,
whether
we
be
Jews
or
Gentiles,
whether
we
be
bond
or
free;
and
have
been
all
made
to
drink
into
one
Spirit.
012:014
For
the
body
is
not
one
member,
but
many.
012:015
If
the
foot
shall
say,
Because
I
am
not
the
hand,
I
am
not
of
the
body;
is
it
therefore
not
of
the
body?
012:016
And
if
the
ear
shall
say,
Because
I
am
not
the
eye,
I
am
not
of
the
body;
is
it
therefore
not
of
the
body?
012:017
If
the
whole
body
were
an
eye,
where
were
the
hearing?
If
the
whole
were
hearing,
where
were
the
smelling?
012:018
But
now
hath
God
set
the
members
every
one
of
them
in
the
body,
as
it
hath
pleased
him.
012:019
And
if
they
were
all
one
member,
where
were
the
body?
012:020
But
now
are
they
many
members,
yet
but
one
body.
012:021
And
the
eye
cannot
say
unto
the
hand,
I
have
no
need
of
thee:
nor
again
the
head
to
the
feet,
I
have
no
need
of
you.
012:022
Nay,
much
more
those
members
of
the
body,
which
seem
to
be
more
feeble,
are
necessary:
012:023
And
those
members
of
the
body,
which
we
think
to
be
less
honourable,
upon
these
we
bestow
more
abundant
honour;
and
our
uncomely
parts
have
more
abundant
comeliness.
012:024
For
our
comely
parts
have
no
need:
but
God
hath
tempered
the
body
together,
having
given
more
abundant
honour
to
that
part
which
lacked.
012:025
That
there
should
be
no
schism
in
the
body;
but
that
the
members
should
have
the
same
care
one
for
another.
012:026
And
whether
one
member
suffer,
all
the
members
suffer
with
it;
or
one
member
be
honoured,
all
the
members
rejoice
with
it.
012:027
Now
ye
are
the
body
of
Christ,
and
members
in
particular.
012:028
And
God
hath
set
some
in
the
church,
first
apostles,
secondarily
prophets,
thirdly
teachers,
after
that
miracles,
then
gifts
of
healings,
helps,
governments,
diversities
of
tongues.
012:029
Are
all
apostles?
are
all
prophets?
are
all
teachers?
are
all
workers
of
miracles?
012:030
Have
all
the
gifts
of
healing?
do
all
speak
with
tongues?
do
all
interpret?
012:031
But
covet
earnestly
the
best
gifts:
and
yet
shew
I
unto
you
a
more
excellent
way.
013:001
Though
I
speak
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
of
angels,
and
have
not
charity,
I
am
become
as
sounding
brass,
or
a
tinkling
cymbal.
013:002
And
though
I
have
the
gift
of
prophecy,
and
understand
all
mysteries,
and
all
knowledge;
and
though
I
have
all
faith,
so
that
I
could
remove
mountains,
and
have
not
charity,
I
am
nothing.
013:003
And
though
I
bestow
all
my
goods
to
feed
the
poor,
and
though
I
give
my
body
to
be
burned,
and
have
not
charity,
it
profiteth
me
nothing.
013:004
Charity
suffereth
long,
and
is
kind;
charity
envieth
not;
charity
vaunteth
not
itself,
is
not
puffed
up,
013:005
Doth
not
behave
itself
unseemly,
seeketh
not
her
own,
is
not
easily
provoked,
thinketh
no
evil;
013:006
Rejoiceth
not
in
iniquity,
but
rejoiceth
in
the
truth;
013:007
Beareth
all
things,
believeth
all
things,
hopeth
all
things,
endureth
all
things.
013:008
Charity
never
faileth:
but
whether
there
be
prophecies,
they
shall
fail;
whether
there
be
tongues,
they
shall
cease;
whether
there
be
knowledge,
it
shall
vanish
away.
013:009
For
we
know
in
part,
and
we
prophesy
in
part.
013:010
But
when
that
which
is
perfect
is
come,
then
that
which
is
in
part
shall
be
done
away.
013:011
When
I
was
a
child,
I
spake
as
a
child,
I
understood
as
a
child,
I
thought
as
a
child:
but
when
I
became
a
man,
I
put
away
childish
things.
013:012
For
now
we
see
through
a
glass,
darkly;
but
then
face
to
face:
now
I
know
in
part;
but
then
shall
I
know
even
as
also
I
am
known.
013:013
And
now
abideth
faith,
hope,
charity,
these
three;
but
the
greatest
of
these
is
charity.
014:001
Follow
after
charity,
and
desire
spiritual
gifts,
but
rather
that
ye
may
prophesy.
014:002
For
he
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
speaketh
not
unto
men,
but
unto
God:
for
no
man
understandeth
him;
howbeit
in
the
spirit
he
speaketh
mysteries.
014:003
But
he
that
prophesieth
speaketh
unto
men
to
edification,
and
exhortation,
and
comfort.
014:004
He
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
edifieth
himself;
but
he
that
prophesieth
edifieth
the
church.
014:005
I
would
that
ye
all
spake
with
tongues
but
rather
that
ye
prophesied:
for
greater
is
he
that
prophesieth
than
he
that
speaketh
with
tongues,
except
he
interpret,
that
the
church
may
receive
edifying.
014:006
Now,
brethren,
if
I
come
unto
you
speaking
with
tongues,
what
shall
I
profit
you,
except
I
shall
speak
to
you
either
by
revelation,
or
by
knowledge,
or
by
prophesying,
or
by
doctrine?
014:007
And
even
things
without
life
giving
sound,
whether
pipe
or
harp,
except
they
give
a
distinction
in
the
sounds,
how
shall
it
be
known
what
is
piped
or
harped?
014:008
For
if
the
trumpet
give
an
uncertain
sound,
who
shall
prepare
himself
to
the
battle?
014:009
So
likewise
ye,
except
ye
utter
by
the
tongue
words
easy
to
be
understood,
how
shall
it
be
known
what
is
spoken?
for
ye
shall
speak
into
the
air.
014:010
There
are,
it
may
be,
so
many
kinds
of
voices
in
the
world,
and
none
of
them
is
without
signification.
014:011
Therefore
if
I
know
not
the
meaning
of
the
voice,
I
shall
be
unto
him
that
speaketh
a
barbarian,
and
he
that
speaketh
shall
be
a
barbarian
unto
me.
014:012
Even
so
ye,
forasmuch
as
ye
are
zealous
of
spiritual
gifts,
seek
that
ye
may
excel
to
the
edifying
of
the
church.
014:013
Wherefore
let
him
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
pray
that
he
may
interpret.
014:014
For
if
I
pray
in
an
unknown
tongue,
my
spirit
prayeth,
but
my
understanding
is
unfruitful.
014:015
What
is
it
then?
I
will
pray
with
the
spirit,
and
I
will
pray
with
the
understanding
also:
I
will
sing
with
the
spirit,
and
I
will
sing
with
the
understanding
also.
014:016
Else
when
thou
shalt
bless
with
the
spirit,
how
shall
he
that
occupieth
the
room
of
the
unlearned
say
Amen
at
thy
giving
of
thanks,
seeing
he
understandeth
not
what
thou
sayest?
014:017
For
thou
verily
givest
thanks
well,
but
the
other
is
not
edified.
014:018
I
thank
my
God,
I
speak
with
tongues
more
than
ye
all:
014:019
Yet
in
the
church
I
had
rather
speak
five
words
with
my
understanding,
that
by
my
voice
I
might
teach
others
also,
than
ten
thousand
words
in
an
unknown
tongue.
014:020
Brethren,
be
not
children
in
understanding:
howbeit
in
malice
be
ye
children,
but
in
understanding
be
men.
014:021
In
the
law
it
is
written,
With
men
of
other
tongues
and
other
lips
will
I
speak
unto
this
people;
and
yet
for
all
that
will
they
not
hear
me,
saith
the
Lord.
014:022
Wherefore
tongues
are
for
a
sign,
not
to
them
that
believe,
but
to
them
that
believe
not:
but
prophesying
serveth
not
for
them
that
believe
not,
but
for
them
which
believe.
014:023
If
therefore
the
whole
church
be
come
together
into
one
place,
and
all
speak
with
tongues,
and
there
come
in
those
that
are
unlearned,
or
unbelievers,
will
they
not
say
that
ye
are
mad?
014:024
But
if
all
prophesy,
and
there
come
in
one
that
believeth
not,
or
one
unlearned,
he
is
convinced
of
all,
he
is
judged
of
all:
014:025
And
thus
are
the
secrets
of
his
heart
made
manifest;
and
so
falling
down
on
his
face
he
will
worship
God,
and
report
that
God
is
in
you
of
a
truth.
014:026
How
is
it
then,
brethren?
when
ye
come
together,
every
one
of
you
hath
a
psalm,
hath
a
doctrine,
hath
a
tongue,
hath
a
revelation,
hath
an
interpretation.
Let
all
things
be
done
unto
edifying.
014:027
If
any
man
speak
in
an
unknown
tongue,
let
it
be
by
two,
or
at
the
most
by
three,
and
that
by
course;
and
let
one
interpret.
014:028
But
if
there
be
no
interpreter,
let
him
keep
silence
in
the
church;
and
let
him
speak
to
himself,
and
to
God.
014:029
Let
the
prophets
speak
two
or
three,
and
let
the
other
judge.
014:030
If
any
thing
be
revealed
to
another
that
sitteth
by,
let
the
first
hold
his
peace.
014:031
For
ye
may
all
prophesy
one
by
one,
that
all
may
learn,
and
all
may
be
comforted.
014:032
And
the
spirits
of
the
prophets
are
subject
to
the
prophets.
014:033
For
God
is
not
the
author
of
confusion,
but
of
peace,
as
in
all
churches
of
the
saints.
014:034
Let
your
women
keep
silence
in
the
churches:
for
it
is
not
permitted
unto
them
to
speak;
but
they
are
commanded
to
be
under
obedience
as
also
saith
the
law.
014:035
And
if
they
will
learn
any
thing,
let
them
ask
their
husbands
at
home:
for
it
is
a
shame
for
women
to
speak
in
the
church.
014:036
What?
came
the
word
of
God
out
from
you?
or
came
it
unto
you
only?
014:037
If
any
man
think
himself
to
be
a
prophet,
or
spiritual,
let
him
acknowledge
that
the
things
that
I
write
unto
you
are
the
commandments
of
the
Lord.
014:038
But
if
any
man
be
ignorant,
let
him
be
ignorant.
014:039
Wherefore,
brethren,
covet
to
prophesy,
and
forbid
not
to
speak
with
tongues.
014:040
Let
all
things
be
done
decently
and
in
order.
015:001
Moreover,
brethren,
I
declare
unto
you
the
gospel
which
I
preached
unto
you,
which
also
ye
have
received,
and
wherein
ye
stand;
015:002
By
which
also
ye
are
saved,
if
ye
keep
in
memory
what
I
preached
unto
you,
unless
ye
have
believed
in
vain.
015:003
For
I
delivered
unto
you
first
of
all
that
which
I
also
received,
how
that
Christ
died
for
our
sins
according
to
the
scriptures;
015:004
And
that
he
was
buried,
and
that
he
rose
again
the
third
day
according
to
the
scriptures:
015:005
And
that
he
was
seen
of
Cephas,
then
of
the
twelve:
015:006
After
that,
he
was
seen
of
above
five
hundred
brethren
at
once;
of
whom
the
greater
part
remain
unto
this
present,
but
some
are
fallen
asleep.
015:007
After
that,
he
was
seen
of
James;
then
of
all
the
apostles.
015:008
And
last
of
all
he
was
seen
of
me
also,
as
of
one
born
out
of
due
time.
015:009
For
I
am
the
least
of
the
apostles,
that
am
not
meet
to
be
called
an
apostle,
because
I
persecuted
the
church
of
God.
015:010
But
by
the
grace
of
God
I
am
what
I
am:
and
his
grace
which
was
bestowed
upon
me
was
not
in
vain;
but
I
laboured
more
abundantly
than
they
all:
yet
not
I,
but
the
grace
of
God
which
was
with
me.
015:011
Therefore
whether
it
were
I
or
they,
so
we
preach,
and
so
ye
believed.
015:012
Now
if
Christ
be
preached
that
he
rose
from
the
dead,
how
say
some
among
you
that
there
is
no
resurrection
of
the
dead?
015:013
But
if
there
be
no
resurrection
of
the
dead,
then
is
Christ
not
risen:
015:014
And
if
Christ
be
not
risen,
then
is
our
preaching
vain,
and
your
faith
is
also
vain.
015:015
Yea,
and
we
are
found
false
witnesses
of
God;
because
we
have
testified
of
God
that
he
raised
up
Christ:
whom
he
raised
not
up,
if
so
be
that
the
dead
rise
not.
015:016
For
if
the
dead
rise
not,
then
is
not
Christ
raised:
015:017
And
if
Christ
be
not
raised,
your
faith
is
vain;
ye
are
yet
in
your
sins.
015:018
Then
they
also
which
are
fallen
asleep
in
Christ
are
perished.
015:019
If
in
this
life
only
we
have
hope
in
Christ,
we
are
of
all
men
most
miserable.
015:020
But
now
is
Christ
risen
from
the
dead,
and
become
the
firstfruits
of
them
that
slept.
015:021
For
since
by
man
came
death,
by
man
came
also
the
resurrection
of
the
dead.
015:022
For
as
in
Adam
all
die,
even
so
in
Christ
shall
all
be
made
alive.
015:023
But
every
man
in
his
own
order:
Christ
the
firstfruits;
afterward
they
that
are
Christ's
at
his
coming.
015:024
Then
cometh
the
end,
when
he
shall
have
delivered
up
the
kingdom
to
God,
even
the
Father;
when
he
shall
have
put
down
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
power.
015:025
For
he
must
reign,
till
he
hath
put
all
enemies
under
his
feet.
015:026
The
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
death.
015:027
For
he
hath
put
all
things
under
his
feet.
But
when
he
saith
all
things
are
put
under
him,
it
is
manifest
that
he
is
excepted,
which
did
put
all
things
under
him.
015:028
And
when
all
things
shall
be
subdued
unto
him,
then
shall
the
Son
also
himself
be
subject
unto
him
that
put
all
things
under
him,
that
God
may
be
all
in
all.
015:029
Else
what
shall
they
do
which
are
baptized
for
the
dead,
if
the
dead
rise
not
at
all?
why
are
they
then
baptized
for
the
dead?
015:030
And
why
stand
we
in
jeopardy
every
hour?
015:031
I
protest
by
your
rejoicing
which
I
have
in
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord,
I
die
daily.
015:032
If
after
the
manner
of
men
I
have
fought
with
beasts
at
Ephesus,
what
advantageth
it
me,
if
the
dead
rise
not?
let
us
eat
and
drink;
for
to
morrow
we
die.
015:033
Be
not
deceived:
evil
communications
corrupt
good
manners.
015:034
Awake
to
righteousness,
and
sin
not;
for
some
have
not
the
knowledge
of
God:
I
speak
this
to
your
shame.
015:035
But
some
man
will
say,
How
are
the
dead
raised
up?
and
with
what
body
do
they
come?
015:036
Thou
fool,
that
which
thou
sowest
is
not
quickened,
except
it
die:
015:037
And
that
which
thou
sowest,
thou
sowest
not
that
body
that
shall
be,
but
bare
grain,
it
may
chance
of
wheat,
or
of
some
other
grain:
015:038
But
God
giveth
it
a
body
as
it
hath
pleased
him,
and
to
every
seed
his
own
body.
015:039
All
flesh
is
not
the
same
flesh:
but
there
is
one
kind
of
flesh
of
men,
another
flesh
of
beasts,
another
of
fishes,
and
another
of
birds.
015:040
There
are
also
celestial
bodies,
and
bodies
terrestrial:
but
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
one,
and
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
another.
015:041
There
is
one
glory
of
the
sun,
and
another
glory
of
the
moon,
and
another
glory
of
the
stars:
for
one
star
differeth
from
another
star
in
glory.
015:042
So
also
is
the
resurrection
of
the
dead.
It
is
sown
in
corruption;
it
is
raised
in
incorruption:
015:043
It
is
sown
in
dishonour;
it
is
raised
in
glory:
it
is
sown
in
weakness;
it
is
raised
in
power:
015:044
It
is
sown
a
natural
body;
it
is
raised
a
spiritual
body.
There
is
a
natural
body,
and
there
is
a
spiritual
body.
015:045
And
so
it
is
written,
The
first
man
Adam
was
made
a
living
soul;
the
last
Adam
was
made
a
quickening
spirit.
015:046
Howbeit
that
was
not
first
which
is
spiritual,
but
that
which
is
natural;
and
afterward
that
which
is
spiritual.
015:047
The
first
man
is
of
the
earth,
earthy;
the
second
man
is
the
Lord
from
heaven.
015:048
As
is
the
earthy,
such
are
they
also
that
are
earthy:
and
as
is
the
heavenly,
such
are
they
also
that
are
heavenly.
015:049
And
as
we
have
borne
the
image
of
the
earthy,
we
shall
also
bear
the
image
of
the
heavenly.
015:050
Now
this
I
say,
brethren,
that
flesh
and
blood
cannot
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God;
neither
doth
corruption
inherit
incorruption.
015:051
Behold,
I
shew
you
a
mystery;
We
shall
not
all
sleep,
but
we
shall
all
be
changed,
015:052
In
a
moment,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye,
at
the
last
trump:
for
the
trumpet
shall
sound,
and
the
dead
shall
be
raised
incorruptible,
and
we
shall
be
changed.
015:053
For
this
corruptible
must
put
on
incorruption,
and
this
mortal
must
put
on
immortality.
015:054
So
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption,
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality,
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
the
saying
that
is
written,
Death
is
swallowed
up
in
victory.
015:055
O
death,
where
is
thy
sting?
O
grave,
where
is
thy
victory?
015:056
The
sting
of
death
is
sin;
and
the
strength
of
sin
is
the
law.
015:057
But
thanks
be
to
God,
which
giveth
us
the
victory
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
015:058
Therefore,
my
beloved
brethren,
be
ye
stedfast,
unmoveable,
always
abounding
in
the
work
of
the
Lord,
forasmuch
as
ye
know
that
your
labour
is
not
in
vain
in
the
Lord.
016:001
Now
concerning
the
collection
for
the
saints,
as
I
have
given
order
to
the
churches
of
Galatia,
even
so
do
ye.
016:002
Upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
let
every
one
of
you
lay
by
him
in
store,
as
God
hath
prospered
him,
that
there
be
no
gatherings
when
I
come.
016:003
And
when
I
come,
whomsoever
ye
shall
approve
by
your
letters,
them
will
I
send
to
bring
your
liberality
unto
Jerusalem.
016:004
And
if
it
be
meet
that
I
go
also,
they
shall
go
with
me.
016:005
Now
I
will
come
unto
you,
when
I
shall
pass
through
Macedonia:
for
I
do
pass
through
Macedonia.
016:006
And
it
may
be
that
I
will
abide,
yea,
and
winter
with
you,
that
ye
may
bring
me
on
my
journey
whithersoever
I
go.
016:007
For
I
will
not
see
you
now
by
the
way;
but
I
trust
to
tarry
a
while
with
you,
if
the
Lord
permit.
016:008
But
I
will
tarry
at
Ephesus
until
Pentecost.
016:009
For
a
great
door
and
effectual
is
opened
unto
me,
and
there
are
many
adversaries.
016:010
Now
if
Timotheus
come,
see
that
he
may
be
with
you
without
fear:
for
he
worketh
the
work
of
the
Lord,
as
I
also
do.
016:011
Let
no
man
therefore
despise
him:
but
conduct
him
forth
in
peace,
that
he
may
come
unto
me:
for
I
look
for
him
with
the
brethren.
016:012
As
touching
our
brother
Apollos,
I
greatly
desired
him
to
come
unto
you
with
the
brethren:
but
his
will
was
not
at
all
to
come
at
this
time;
but
he
will
come
when
he
shall
have
convenient
time.
016:013
Watch
ye,
stand
fast
in
the
faith,
quit
you
like
men,
be
strong.
016:014
Let
all
your
things
be
done
with
charity.
016:015
I
beseech
you,
brethren,
(ye
know
the
house
of
Stephanas,
that
it
is
the
firstfruits
of
Achaia,
and
that
they
have
addicted
themselves
to
the
ministry
of
the
saints,)
016:016
That
ye
submit
yourselves
unto
such,
and
to
every
one
that
helpeth
with
us,
and
laboureth.
016:017
I
am
glad
of
the
coming
of
Stephanas
and
Fortunatus
and
Achaicus:
for
that
which
was
lacking
on
your
part
they
have
supplied.
016:018
For
they
have
refreshed
my
spirit
and
your's:
therefore
acknowledge
ye
them
that
are
such.
016:019
The
churches
of
Asia
salute
you.
Aquila
and
Priscilla
salute
you
much
in
the
Lord,
with
the
church
that
is
in
their
house.
016:020
All
the
brethren
greet
you.
Greet
ye
one
another
with
an
holy
kiss.
016:021
The
salutation
of
me
Paul
with
mine
own
hand.
016:022
If
any
man
love
not
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
let
him
be
Anathema
Maranatha.
016:023
The
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
you.
016:024
My
love
be
with
you
all
in
Christ
Jesus.
Amen.
Book
47	2
Corinthians
001:001
Paul,
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ
by
the
will
of
God,
and
Timothy
our
brother,
unto
the
church
of
God
which
is
at
Corinth,
with
all
the
saints
which
are
in
all
Achaia:
001:002
Grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
God
our
Father,
and
from
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
001:003
Blessed
be
God,
even
the
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
the
Father
of
mercies,
and
the
God
of
all
comfort;
001:004
Who
comforteth
us
in
all
our
tribulation,
that
we
may
be
able
to
comfort
them
which
are
in
any
trouble,
by
the
comfort
wherewith
we
ourselves
are
comforted
of
God.
001:005
For
as
the
sufferings
of
Christ
abound
in
us,
so
our
consolation
also
aboundeth
by
Christ.
001:006
And
whether
we
be
afflicted,
it
is
for
your
consolation
and
salvation,
which
is
effectual
in
the
enduring
of
the
same
sufferings
which
we
also
suffer:
or
whether
we
be
comforted,
it
is
for
your
consolation
and
salvation.
001:007
And
our
hope
of
you
is
stedfast,
knowing,
that
as
ye
are
partakers
of
the
sufferings,
so
shall
ye
be
also
of
the
consolation.
001:008
For
we
would
not,
brethren,
have
you
ignorant
of
our
trouble
which
came
to
us
in
Asia,
that
we
were
pressed
out
of
measure,
above
strength,
insomuch
that
we
despaired
even
of
life:
001:009
But
we
had
the
sentence
of
death
in
ourselves,
that
we
should
not
trust
in
ourselves,
but
in
God
which
raiseth
the
dead:
001:010
Who
delivered
us
from
so
great
a
death,
and
doth
deliver:
in
whom
we
trust
that
he
will
yet
deliver
us;
001:011
Ye
also
helping
together
by
prayer
for
us,
that
for
the
gift
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
means
of
many
persons
thanks
may
be
given
by
many
on
our
behalf.
001:012
For
our
rejoicing
is
this,
the
testimony
of
our
conscience,
that
in
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity,
not
with
fleshly
wisdom,
but
by
the
grace
of
God,
we
have
had
our
conversation
in
the
world,
and
more
abundantly
to
you-ward.
001:013
For
we
write
none
other
things
unto
you,
than
what
ye
read
or
acknowledge;
and
I
trust
ye
shall
acknowledge
even
to
the
end;
001:014
As
also
ye
have
acknowledged
us
in
part,
that
we
are
your
rejoicing,
even
as
ye
also
are
our's
in
the
day
of
the
Lord
Jesus.
001:015
And
in
this
confidence
I
was
minded
to
come
unto
you
before,
that
ye
might
have
a
second
benefit;
001:016
And
to
pass
by
you
into
Macedonia,
and
to
come
again
out
of
Macedonia
unto
you,
and
of
you
to
be
brought
on
my
way
toward
Judaea.
001:017
When
I
therefore
was
thus
minded,
did
I
use
lightness?
or
the
things
that
I
purpose,
do
I
purpose
according
to
the
flesh,
that
with
me
there
should
be
yea
yea,
and
nay
nay?
001:018
But
as
God
is
true,
our
word
toward
you
was
not
yea
and
nay.
001:019
For
the
Son
of
God,
Jesus
Christ,
who
was
preached
among
you
by
us,
even
by
me
and
Silvanus
and
Timotheus,
was
not
yea
and
nay,
but
in
him
was
yea.
001:020
For
all
the
promises
of
God
in
him
are
yea,
and
in
him
Amen,
unto
the
glory
of
God
by
us.
001:021
Now
he
which
stablisheth
us
with
you
in
Christ,
and
hath
anointed
us,
is
God;
001:022
Who
hath
also
sealed
us,
and
given
the
earnest
of
the
Spirit
in
our
hearts.
001:023
Moreover
I
call
God
for
a
record
upon
my
soul,
that
to
spare
