I
fear,
lest
by
any
means,
as
the
serpent
beguiled
Eve
through
his
subtilty,
so
your
minds
should
be
corrupted
from
the
simplicity
that
is
in
Christ.
011:004
For
if
he
that
cometh
preacheth
another
Jesus,
whom
we
have
not
preached,
or
if
ye
receive
another
spirit,
which
ye
have
not
received,
or
another
gospel,
which
ye
have
not
accepted,
ye
might
well
bear
with
him.
011:005
For
I
suppose
I
was
not
a
whit
behind
the
very
chiefest
apostles.
011:006
But
though
I
be
rude
in
speech,
yet
not
in
knowledge;
but
we
have
been
throughly
made
manifest
among
you
in
all
things.
011:007
Have
I
committed
an
offence
in
abasing
myself
that
ye
might
be
exalted,
because
I
have
preached
to
you
the
gospel
of
God
freely?
011:008
I
robbed
other
churches,
taking
wages
of
them,
to
do
you
service.
011:009
And
when
I
was
present
with
you,
and
wanted,
I
was
chargeable
to
no
man:
for
that
which
was
lacking
to
me
the
brethren
which
came
from
Macedonia
supplied:
and
in
all
things
I
have
kept
myself
from
being
burdensome
unto
you,
and
so
will
I
keep
myself.
011:010
As
the
truth
of
Christ
is
in
me,
no
man
shall
stop
me
of
this
boasting
in
the
regions
of
Achaia.
011:011
Wherefore?
because
I
love
you
not?
God
knoweth.
011:012
But
what
I
do,
that
I
will
do,
that
I
may
cut
off
occasion
from
them
which
desire
occasion;
that
wherein
they
glory,
they
may
be
found
even
as
we.
011:013
For
such
are
false
apostles,
deceitful
workers,
transforming
themselves
into
the
apostles
of
Christ.
011:014
And
no
marvel;
for
Satan
himself
is
transformed
into
an
angel
of
light.
011:015
Therefore
it
is
no
great
thing
if
his
ministers
also
be
transformed
as
the
ministers
of
righteousness;
whose
end
shall
be
according
to
their
works.
011:016
I
say
again,
Let
no
man
think
me
a
fool;
if
otherwise,
yet
as
a
fool
receive
me,
that
I
may
boast
myself
a
little.
011:017
That
which
I
speak,
I
speak
it
not
after
the
Lord,
but
as
it
were
foolishly,
in
this
confidence
of
boasting.
011:018
Seeing
that
many
glory
after
the
flesh,
I
will
glory
also.
011:019
For
ye
suffer
fools
gladly,
seeing
ye
yourselves
are
wise.
011:020
For
ye
suffer,
if
a
man
bring
you
into
bondage,
if
a
man
devour
you,
if
a
man
take
of
you,
if
a
man
exalt
himself,
if
a
man
smite
you
on
the
face.
011:021
I
speak
as
concerning
reproach,
as
though
we
had
been
weak.
Howbeit
whereinsoever
any
is
bold,
(I
speak
foolishly,)
I
am
bold
also.
011:022
Are
they
Hebrews?
so
am
I.
Are
they
Israelites?
so
am
I.
Are
they
the
seed
of
Abraham?
so
am
I.
011:023
Are
they
ministers
of
Christ?
(I
speak
as
a
fool)
I
am
more;
in
labours
more
abundant,
in
stripes
above
measure,
in
prisons
more
frequent,
in
deaths
oft.
011:024
Of
the
Jews
five
times
received
I
forty
stripes
save
one.
011:025
Thrice
was
I
beaten
with
rods,
once
was
I
stoned,
thrice
I
suffered
shipwreck,
a
night
and
a
day
I
have
been
in
the
deep;
011:026
In
journeyings
often,
in
perils
of
waters,
in
perils
of
robbers,
in
perils
by
mine
own
countrymen,
in
perils
by
the
heathen,
in
perils
in
the
city,
in
perils
in
the
wilderness,
in
perils
in
the
sea,
in
perils
among
false
brethren;
011:027
In
weariness
and
painfulness,
in
watchings
often,
in
hunger
and
thirst,
in
fastings
often,
in
cold
and
nakedness.
011:028
Beside
those
things
that
are
without,
that
which
cometh
upon
me
daily,
the
care
of
all
the
churches.
011:029
Who
is
weak,
and
I
am
not
weak?
who
is
offended,
and
I
burn
not?
011:030
If
I
must
needs
glory,
I
will
glory
of
the
things
which
concern
mine
infirmities.
011:031
The
God
and
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
which
is
blessed
for
evermore,
knoweth
that
I
lie
not.
011:032
In
Damascus
the
governor
under
Aretas
the
king
kept
the
city
of
the
Damascenes
with
a
garrison,
desirous
to
apprehend
me:
011:033
And
through
a
window
in
a
basket
was
I
let
down
by
the
wall,
and
escaped
his
hands.
012:001
It
is
not
expedient
for
me
doubtless
to
glory.
I
will
come
to
visions
and
revelations
of
the
Lord.
012:002
I
knew
a
man
in
Christ
above
fourteen
years
ago,
(whether
in
the
body,
I
cannot
tell;
or
whether
out
of
the
body,
I
cannot
tell:
God
knoweth;)
such
an
one
caught
up
to
the
third
heaven.
012:003
And
I
knew
such
a
man,
(whether
in
the
body,
or
out
of
the
body,
I
cannot
tell:
God
knoweth;)
012:004
How
that
he
was
caught
up
into
paradise,
and
heard
unspeakable
words,
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
utter.
012:005
Of
such
an
one
will
I
glory:
yet
of
myself
I
will
not
glory,
but
in
mine
infirmities.
012:006
For
though
I
would
desire
to
glory,
I
shall
not
be
a
fool;
for
I
will
say
the
truth:
but
now
I
forbear,
lest
any
man
should
think
of
me
above
that
which
he
seeth
me
to
be,
or
that
he
heareth
of
me.
012:007
And
lest
I
should
be
exalted
above
measure
through
the
abundance
of
the
revelations,
there
was
given
to
me
a
thorn
in
the
flesh,
the
messenger
of
Satan
to
buffet
me,
lest
I
should
be
exalted
above
measure.
012:008
For
this
thing
I
besought
the
Lord
thrice,
that
it
might
depart
from
me.
012:009
And
he
said
unto
me,
My
grace
is
sufficient
for
thee:
for
my
strength
is
made
perfect
in
weakness.
Most
gladly
therefore
will
I
rather
glory
in
my
infirmities,
that
the
power
of
Christ
may
rest
upon
me.
012:010
Therefore
I
take
pleasure
in
infirmities,
in
reproaches,
in
necessities,
in
persecutions,
in
distresses
for
Christ's
sake:
for
when
I
am
weak,
then
am
I
strong.
012:011
I
am
become
a
fool
in
glorying;
ye
have
compelled
me:
for
I
ought
to
have
been
commended
of
you:
for
in
nothing
am
I
behind
the
very
chiefest
apostles,
though
I
be
nothing.
012:012
Truly
the
signs
of
an
apostle
were
wrought
among
you
in
all
patience,
in
signs,
and
wonders,
and
mighty
deeds.
012:013
For
what
is
it
wherein
ye
were
inferior
to
other
churches,
except
it
be
that
I
myself
was
not
burdensome
to
you?
forgive
me
this
wrong.
012:014
Behold,
the
third
time
I
am
ready
to
come
to
you;
and
I
will
not
be
burdensome
to
you:
for
I
seek
not
your's
but
you:
for
the
children
ought
not
to
lay
up
for
the
parents,
but
the
parents
for
the
children.
012:015
And
I
will
very
gladly
spend
and
be
spent
for
you;
though
the
more
abundantly
I
love
you,
the
less
I
be
loved.
012:016
But
be
it
so,
I
did
not
burden
you:
nevertheless,
being
crafty,
I
caught
you
with
guile.
012:017
Did
I
make
a
gain
of
you
by
any
of
them
whom
I
sent
unto
you?
012:018
I
desired
Titus,
and
with
him
I
sent
a
brother.
Did
Titus
make
a
gain
of
you?
walked
we
not
in
the
same
spirit?
walked
we
not
in
the
same
steps?
012:019
Again,
think
ye
that
we
excuse
ourselves
unto
you?
we
speak
before
God
in
Christ:
but
we
do
all
things,
dearly
beloved,
for
your
edifying.
012:020
For
I
fear,
lest,
when
I
come,
I
shall
not
find
you
such
as
I
would,
and
that
I
shall
be
found
unto
you
such
as
ye
would
not:
lest
there
be
debates,
envyings,
wraths,
strifes,
backbitings,
whisperings,
swellings,
tumults:
012:021
And
lest,
when
I
come
again,
my
God
will
humble
me
among
you,
and
that
I
shall
bewail
many
which
have
sinned
already,
and
have
not
repented
of
the
uncleanness
and
fornication
and
lasciviousness
which
they
have
committed.
013:001
This
is
the
third
time
I
am
coming
to
you.
In
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
shall
every
word
be
established.
013:002
I
told
you
before,
and
foretell
you,
as
if
I
were
present,
the
second
time;
and
being
absent
now
I
write
to
them
which
heretofore
have
sinned,
and
to
all
other,
that,
if
I
come
again,
I
will
not
spare:
013:003
Since
ye
seek
a
proof
of
Christ
speaking
in
me,
which
to
you-ward
is
not
weak,
but
is
mighty
in
you.
013:004
For
though
he
was
crucified
through
weakness,
yet
he
liveth
by
the
power
of
God.
For
we
also
are
weak
in
him,
but
we
shall
live
with
him
by
the
power
of
God
toward
you.
013:005
Examine
yourselves,
whether
ye
be
in
the
faith;
prove
your
own
selves.
Know
ye
not
your
own
selves,
how
that
Jesus
Christ
is
in
you,
except
ye
be
reprobates?
013:006
But
I
trust
that
ye
shall
know
that
we
are
not
reprobates.
013:007
Now
I
pray
to
God
that
ye
do
no
evil;
not
that
we
should
appear
approved,
but
that
ye
should
do
that
which
is
honest,
though
we
be
as
reprobates.
013:008
For
we
can
do
nothing
against
the
truth,
but
for
the
truth.
013:009
For
we
are
glad,
when
we
are
weak,
and
ye
are
strong:
and
this
also
we
wish,
even
your
perfection.
013:010
Therefore
I
write
these
things
being
absent,
lest
being
present
I
should
use
sharpness,
according
to
the
power
which
the
Lord
hath
given
me
to
edification,
and
not
to
destruction.
013:011
Finally,
brethren,
farewell.
Be
perfect,
be
of
good
comfort,
be
of
one
mind,
live
in
peace;
and
the
God
of
love
and
peace
shall
be
with
you.
013:012
Greet
one
another
with
an
holy
kiss.
013:013
All
the
saints
salute
you.
013:014
The
grace
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
and
the
love
of
God,
and
the
communion
of
the
Holy
Ghost,
be
with
you
all.
Amen.
Book
48	Galatians
001:001
Paul,
an
apostle,
(not
of
men,
neither
by
man,
but
by
Jesus
Christ,
and
God
the
Father,
who
raised
him
from
the
dead;)
001:002
And
all
the
brethren
which
are
with
me,
unto
the
churches
of
Galatia:
001:003
Grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
God
the
Father,
and
from
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
001:004
Who
gave
himself
for
our
sins,
that
he
might
deliver
us
from
this
present
evil
world,
according
to
the
will
of
God
and
our
Father:
001:005
To
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever.
Amen.
001:006
I
marvel
that
ye
are
so
soon
removed
from
him
that
called
you
into
the
grace
of
Christ
unto
another
gospel:
001:007
Which
is
not
another;
but
there
be
some
that
trouble
you,
and
would
pervert
the
gospel
of
Christ.
001:008
But
though
we,
or
an
angel
from
heaven,
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
which
we
have
preached
unto
you,
let
him
be
accursed.
001:009
As
we
said
before,
so
say
I
now
again,
if
any
man
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
ye
have
received,
let
him
be
accursed.
001:010
For
do
I
now
persuade
men,
or
God?
or
do
I
seek
to
please
men?
for
if
I
yet
pleased
men,
I
should
not
be
the
servant
of
Christ.
001:011
But
I
certify
you,
brethren,
that
the
gospel
which
was
preached
of
me
is
not
after
man.
001:012
For
I
neither
received
it
of
man,
neither
was
I
taught
it,
but
by
the
revelation
of
Jesus
Christ.
001:013
For
ye
have
heard
of
my
conversation
in
time
past
in
the
Jews'
religion,
how
that
beyond
measure
I
persecuted
the
church
of
God,
and
wasted
it:
001:014
And
profited
in
the
Jews'
religion
above
many
my
equals
in
mine
own
nation,
being
more
exceedingly
zealous
of
the
traditions
of
my
fathers.
001:015
But
when
it
pleased
God,
who
separated
me
from
my
mother's
womb,
and
called
me
by
his
grace,
001:016
To
reveal
his
Son
in
me,
that
I
might
preach
him
among
the
heathen;
immediately
I
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
blood:
001:017
Neither
went
I
up
to
Jerusalem
to
them
which
were
apostles
before
me;
but
I
went
into
Arabia,
and
returned
again
unto
Damascus.
001:018
Then
after
three
years
I
went
up
to
Jerusalem
to
see
Peter,
and
abode
with
him
fifteen
days.
001:019
But
other
of
the
apostles
saw
I
none,
save
James
the
Lord's
brother.
001:020
Now
the
things
which
I
write
unto
you,
behold,
before
God,
I
lie
not.
001:021
Afterwards
I
came
into
the
regions
of
Syria
and
Cilicia;
001:022
And
was
unknown
by
face
unto
the
churches
of
Judaea
which
were
in
Christ:
001:023
But
they
had
heard
only,
That
he
which
persecuted
us
in
times
past
now
preacheth
the
faith
which
once
he
destroyed.
001:024
And
they
glorified
God
in
me.
002:001
Then
fourteen
years
after
I
went
up
again
to
Jerusalem
with
Barnabas,
and
took
Titus
with
me
also.
002:002
And
I
went
up
by
revelation,
and
communicated
unto
them
that
gospel
which
I
preach
among
the
Gentiles,
but
privately
to
them
which
were
of
reputation,
lest
by
any
means
I
should
run,
or
had
run,
in
vain.
002:003
But
neither
Titus,
who
was
with
me,
being
a
Greek,
was
compelled
to
be
circumcised:
002:004
And
that
because
of
false
brethren
unawares
brought
in,
who
came
in
privily
to
spy
out
our
liberty
which
we
have
in
Christ
Jesus,
that
they
might
bring
us
into
bondage:
002:005
To
whom
we
gave
place
by
subjection,
no,
not
for
an
hour;
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
might
continue
with
you.
002:006
But
of
these
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat,
(whatsoever
they
were,
it
maketh
no
matter
to
me:
God
accepteth
no
man's
person:)
for
they
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
in
conference
added
nothing
to
me:
002:007
But
contrariwise,
when
they
saw
that
the
gospel
of
the
uncircumcision
was
committed
unto
me,
as
the
gospel
of
the
circumcision
was
unto
Peter;
002:008
(For
he
that
wrought
effectually
in
Peter
to
the
apostleship
of
the
circumcision,
the
same
was
mighty
in
me
toward
the
Gentiles:)
002:009
And
when
James,
Cephas,
and
John,
who
seemed
to
be
pillars,
perceived
the
grace
that
was
given
unto
me,
they
gave
to
me
and
Barnabas
the
right
hands
of
fellowship;
that
we
should
go
unto
the
heathen,
and
they
unto
the
circumcision.
002:010
Only
they
would
that
we
should
remember
the
poor;
the
same
which
I
also
was
forward
to
do.
002:011
But
when
Peter
was
come
to
Antioch,
I
withstood
him
to
the
face,
because
he
was
to
be
blamed.
002:012
For
before
that
certain
came
from
James,
he
did
eat
with
the
Gentiles:
but
when
they
were
come,
he
withdrew
and
separated
himself,
fearing
them
which
were
of
the
circumcision.
002:013
And
the
other
Jews
dissembled
likewise
with
him;
insomuch
that
Barnabas
also
was
carried
away
with
their
dissimulation.
002:014
But
when
I
saw
that
they
walked
not
uprightly
according
to
the
truth
of
the
gospel,
I
said
unto
Peter
before
them
all,
If
thou,
being
a
Jew,
livest
after
the
manner
of
Gentiles,
and
not
as
do
the
Jews,
why
compellest
thou
the
Gentiles
to
live
as
do
the
Jews?
002:015
We
who
are
Jews
by
nature,
and
not
sinners
of
the
Gentiles,
002:016
Knowing
that
a
man
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law,
but
by
the
faith
of
Jesus
Christ,
even
we
have
believed
in
Jesus
Christ,
that
we
might
be
justified
by
the
faith
of
Christ,
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
law:
for
by
the
works
of
the
law
shall
no
flesh
be
justified.
002:017
But
if,
while
we
seek
to
be
justified
by
Christ,
we
ourselves
also
are
found
sinners,
is
therefore
Christ
the
minister
of
sin?
God
forbid.
002:018
For
if
I
build
again
the
things
which
I
destroyed,
I
make
myself
a
transgressor.
002:019
For
I
through
the
law
am
dead
to
the
law,
that
I
might
live
unto
God.
002:020
I
am
crucified
with
Christ:
neverthless
I
live;
yet
not
I,
but
Christ
liveth
in
me:
and
the
life
which
I
now
live
in
the
flesh
I
live
by
the
faith
of
the
Son
of
God,
who
loved
me,
and
gave
himself
for
me.
002:021
I
do
not
frustrate
the
grace
of
God:
for
if
righteousness
come
by
the
law,
then
Christ
is
dead
in
vain.
003:001
O
foolish
Galatians,
who
hath
bewitched
you,
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth,
before
whose
eyes
Jesus
Christ
hath
been
evidently
set
forth,
crucified
among
you?
003:002
This
only
would
I
learn
of
you,
Received
ye
the
Spirit
by
the
works
of
the
law,
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith?
003:003
Are
ye
so
foolish?
having
begun
in
the
Spirit,
are
ye
now
made
perfect
by
the
flesh?
003:004
Have
ye
suffered
so
many
things
in
vain?
if
it
be
yet
in
vain.
003:005
He
therefore
that
ministereth
to
you
the
Spirit,
and
worketh
miracles
among
you,
doeth
he
it
by
the
works
of
the
law,
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith?
003:006
Even
as
Abraham
believed
God,
and
it
was
accounted
to
him
for
righteousness.
003:007
Know
ye
therefore
that
they
which
are
of
faith,
the
same
are
the
children
of
Abraham.
003:008
And
the
scripture,
foreseeing
that
God
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith,
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
Abraham,
saying,
In
thee
shall
all
nations
be
blessed.
003:009
So
then
they
which
be
of
faith
are
blessed
with
faithful
Abraham.
003:010
For
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse:
for
it
is
written,
Cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them.
003:011
But
that
no
man
is
justified
by
the
law
in
the
sight
of
God,
it
is
evident:
for,
The
just
shall
live
by
faith.
003:012
And
the
law
is
not
of
faith:
but,
The
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
them.
003:013
Christ
hath
redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
law,
being
made
a
curse
for
us:
for
it
is
written,
Cursed
is
every
one
that
hangeth
on
a
tree:
003:014
That
the
blessing
of
Abraham
might
come
on
the
Gentiles
through
Jesus
Christ;
that
we
might
receive
the
promise
of
the
Spirit
through
faith.
003:015
Brethren,
I
speak
after
the
manner
of
men;
Though
it
be
but
a
man's
covenant,
yet
if
it
be
confirmed,
no
man
disannulleth,
or
addeth
thereto.
003:016
Now
to
Abraham
and
his
seed
were
the
promises
made.
He
saith
not,
And
to
seeds,
as
of
many;
but
as
of
one,
And
to
thy
seed,
which
is
Christ.
003:017
And
this
I
say,
that
the
covenant,
that
was
confirmed
before
of
God
in
Christ,
the
law,
which
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after,
cannot
disannul,
that
it
should
make
the
promise
of
none
effect.
003:018
For
if
the
inheritance
be
of
the
law,
it
is
no
more
of
promise:
but
God
gave
it
to
Abraham
by
promise.
003:019
Wherefore
then
serveth
the
law?
It
was
added
because
of
transgressions,
till
the
seed
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
made;
and
it
was
ordained
by
angels
in
the
hand
of
a
mediator.
003:020
Now
a
mediator
is
not
a
mediator
of
one,
but
God
is
one.
003:021
Is
the
law
then
against
the
promises
of
God?
God
forbid:
for
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
which
could
have
given
life,
verily
righteousness
should
have
been
by
the
law.
003:022
But
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
sin,
that
the
promise
by
faith
of
Jesus
Christ
might
be
given
to
them
that
believe.
003:023
But
before
faith
came,
we
were
kept
under
the
law,
shut
up
unto
the
faith
which
should
afterwards
be
revealed.
003:024
Wherefore
the
law
was
our
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
unto
Christ,
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith.
003:025
But
after
that
faith
is
come,
we
are
no
longer
under
a
schoolmaster.
003:026
For
ye
are
all
the
children
of
God
by
faith
in
Christ
Jesus.
003:027
For
as
many
of
you
as
have
been
baptized
into
Christ
have
put
on
Christ.
003:028
There
is
neither
Jew
nor
Greek,
there
is
neither
bond
nor
free,
there
is
neither
male
nor
female:
for
ye
are
all
one
in
Christ
Jesus.
003:029
And
if
ye
be
Christ's,
then
are
ye
Abraham's
seed,
and
heirs
according
to
the
promise.
004:001
Now
I
say,
That
the
heir,
as
long
as
he
is
a
child,
differeth
nothing
from
a
servant,
though
he
be
lord
of
all;
004:002
But
is
under
tutors
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
father.
004:003
Even
so
we,
when
we
were
children,
were
in
bondage
under
the
elements
of
the
world:
004:004
But
when
the
fulness
of
the
time
was
come,
God
sent
forth
his
Son,
made
of
a
woman,
made
under
the
law,
004:005
To
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law,
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
of
sons.
004:006
And
because
ye
are
sons,
God
hath
sent
forth
the
Spirit
of
his
Son
into
your
hearts,
crying,
Abba,
Father.
004:007
Wherefore
thou
art
no
more
a
servant,
but
a
son;
and
if
a
son,
then
an
heir
of
God
through
Christ.
004:008
Howbeit
then,
when
ye
knew
not
God,
ye
did
service
unto
them
which
by
nature
are
no
gods.
004:009
But
now,
after
that
ye
have
known
God,
or
rather
are
known
of
God,
how
turn
ye
again
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements,
whereunto
ye
desire
again
to
be
in
bondage?
004:010
Ye
observe
days,
and
months,
and
times,
and
years.
004:011
I
am
afraid
of
you,
lest
I
have
bestowed
upon
you
labour
in
vain.
004:012
Brethren,
I
beseech
you,
be
as
I
am;
for
I
am
as
ye
are:
ye
have
not
injured
me
at
all.
004:013
Ye
know
how
through
infirmity
of
the
flesh
I
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
at
the
first.
004:014
And
my
temptation
which
was
in
my
flesh
ye
despised
not,
nor
rejected;
but
received
me
as
an
angel
of
God,
even
as
Christ
Jesus.
004:015
Where
is
then
the
blessedness
ye
spake
of?
for
I
bear
you
record,
that,
if
it
had
been
possible,
ye
would
have
plucked
out
your
own
eyes,
and
have
given
them
to
me.
004:016
Am
I
therefore
become
your
enemy,
because
I
tell
you
the
truth?
004:017
They
zealously
affect
you,
but
not
well;
yea,
they
would
exclude
you,
that
ye
might
affect
them.
004:018
But
it
is
good
to
be
zealously
affected
always
in
a
good
thing,
and
not
only
when
I
am
present
with
you.
004:019
My
little
children,
of
whom
I
travail
in
birth
again
until
Christ
be
formed
in
you,
004:020
I
desire
to
be
present
with
you
now,
and
to
change
my
voice;
for
I
stand
in
doubt
of
you.
004:021
Tell
me,
ye
that
desire
to
be
under
the
law,
do
ye
not
hear
the
law?
004:022
For
it
is
written,
that
Abraham
had
two
sons,
the
one
by
a
bondmaid,
the
other
by
a
freewoman.
004:023
But
he
who
was
of
the
bondwoman
was
born
after
the
flesh;
but
he
of
the
freewoman
was
by
promise.
004:024
Which
things
are
an
allegory:
for
these
are
the
two
covenants;
the
one
from
the
mount
Sinai,
which
gendereth
to
bondage,
which
is
Agar.
004:025
For
this
Agar
is
mount
Sinai
in
Arabia,
and
answereth
to
Jerusalem
which
now
is,
and
is
in
bondage
with
her
children.
004:026
But
Jerusalem
which
is
above
is
free,
which
is
the
mother
of
us
all.
004:027
For
it
is
written,
Rejoice,
thou
barren
that
bearest
not;
break
forth
and
cry,
thou
that
travailest
not:
for
the
desolate
hath
many
more
children
than
she
which
hath
an
husband.
004:028
Now
we,
brethren,
as
Isaac
was,
are
the
children
of
promise.
004:029
But
as
then
he
that
was
born
after
the
flesh
persecuted
him
that
was
born
after
the
Spirit,
even
so
it
is
now.
004:030
Nevertheless
what
saith
the
scripture?
Cast
out
the
bondwoman
and
her
son:
for
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
the
son
of
the
freewoman.
004:031
So
then,
brethren,
we
are
not
children
of
the
bondwoman,
but
of
the
free.
005:001
Stand
fast
therefore
in
the
liberty
wherewith
Christ
hath
made
us
free,
and
be
not
entangled
again
with
the
yoke
of
bondage.
005:002
Behold,
I
Paul
say
unto
you,
that
if
ye
be
circumcised,
Christ
shall
profit
you
nothing.
005:003
For
I
testify
again
to
every
man
that
is
circumcised,
that
he
is
a
debtor
to
do
the
whole
law.
005:004
Christ
is
become
