sons
of
Aaron
shall
offer
it
before
the
LORD,
before
the
altar.
006:015
And
he
shall
take
of
it
his
handful,
of
the
flour
of
the
meat
offering,
and
of
the
oil
thereof,
and
all
the
frankincense
which
is
upon
the
meat
offering,
and
shall
burn
it
upon
the
altar
for
a
sweet
savour,
even
the
memorial
of
it,
unto
the
LORD.
006:016
And
the
remainder
thereof
shall
Aaron
and
his
sons
eat:
with
unleavened
bread
shall
it
be
eaten
in
the
holy
place;
in
the
court
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
they
shall
eat
it.
006:017
It
shall
not
be
baken
with
leaven.
I
have
given
it
unto
them
for
their
portion
of
my
offerings
made
by
fire;
it
is
most
holy,
as
is
the
sin
offering,
and
as
the
trespass
offering.
006:018
All
the
males
among
the
children
of
Aaron
shall
eat
of
it.
It
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
in
your
generations
concerning
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire:
every
one
that
toucheth
them
shall
be
holy.
006:019
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
006:020
This
is
the
offering
of
Aaron
and
of
his
sons,
which
they
shall
offer
unto
the
LORD
in
the
day
when
he
is
anointed;
the
tenth
part
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
for
a
meat
offering
perpetual,
half
of
it
in
the
morning,
and
half
thereof
at
night.
006:021
In
a
pan
it
shall
be
made
with
oil;
and
when
it
is
baken,
thou
shalt
bring
it
in:
and
the
baken
pieces
of
the
meat
offering
shalt
thou
offer
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
006:022
And
the
priest
of
his
sons
that
is
anointed
in
his
stead
shall
offer
it:
it
is
a
statute
for
ever
unto
the
LORD;
it
shall
be
wholly
burnt.
006:023
For
every
meat
offering
for
the
priest
shall
be
wholly
burnt:
it
shall
not
be
eaten.
006:024
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
006:025
Speak
unto
Aaron
and
to
his
sons,
saying,
This
is
the
law
of
the
sin
offering:
In
the
place
where
the
burnt
offering
is
killed
shall
the
sin
offering
be
killed
before
the
LORD:
it
is
most
holy.
006:026
The
priest
that
offereth
it
for
sin
shall
eat
it:
in
the
holy
place
shall
it
be
eaten,
in
the
court
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
006:027
Whatsoever
shall
touch
the
flesh
thereof
shall
be
holy:
and
when
there
is
sprinkled
of
the
blood
thereof
upon
any
garment,
thou
shalt
wash
that
whereon
it
was
sprinkled
in
the
holy
place.
006:028
But
the
earthen
vessel
wherein
it
is
sodden
shall
be
broken:
and
if
it
be
sodden
in
a
brasen
pot,
it
shall
be
both
scoured,
and
rinsed
in
water.
006:029
All
the
males
among
the
priests
shall
eat
thereof:
it
is
most
holy.
006:030
And
no
sin
offering,
whereof
any
of
the
blood
is
brought
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
to
reconcile
withal
in
the
holy
place,
shall
be
eaten:
it
shall
be
burnt
in
the
fire.
007:001
Likewise
this
is
the
law
of
the
trespass
offering:
it
is
most
holy.
007:002
In
the
place
where
they
kill
the
burnt
offering
shall
they
kill
the
trespass
offering:
and
the
blood
thereof
shall
he
sprinkle
round
about
upon
the
altar.
007:003
And
he
shall
offer
of
it
all
the
fat
thereof;
the
rump,
and
the
fat
that
covereth
the
inwards,
007:004
And
the
two
kidneys,
and
the
fat
that
is
on
them,
which
is
by
the
flanks,
and
the
caul
that
is
above
the
liver,
with
the
kidneys,
it
shall
he
take
away:
007:005
And
the
priest
shall
burn
them
upon
the
altar
for
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD:
it
is
a
trespass
offering.
007:006
Every
male
among
the
priests
shall
eat
thereof:
it
shall
be
eaten
in
the
holy
place:
it
is
most
holy.
007:007
As
the
sin
offering
is,
so
is
the
trespass
offering:
there
is
one
law
for
them:
the
priest
that
maketh
atonement
therewith
shall
have
it.
007:008
And
the
priest
that
offereth
any
man's
burnt
offering,
even
the
priest
shall
have
to
himself
the
skin
of
the
burnt
offering
which
he
hath
offered.
007:009
And
all
the
meat
offering
that
is
baken
in
the
oven,
and
all
that
is
dressed
in
the
fryingpan,
and
in
the
pan,
shall
be
the
priest's
that
offereth
it.
007:010
And
every
meat
offering,
mingled
with
oil,
and
dry,
shall
all
the
sons
of
Aaron
have,
one
as
much
as
another.
007:011
And
this
is
the
law
of
the
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings,
which
he
shall
offer
unto
the
LORD.
007:012
If
he
offer
it
for
a
thanksgiving,
then
he
shall
offer
with
the
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving
unleavened
cakes
mingled
with
oil,
and
unleavened
wafers
anointed
with
oil,
and
cakes
mingled
with
oil,
of
fine
flour,
fried.
007:013
Besides
the
cakes,
he
shall
offer
for
his
offering
leavened
bread
with
the
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving
of
his
peace
offerings.
007:014
And
of
it
he
shall
offer
one
out
of
the
whole
oblation
for
an
heave
offering
unto
the
LORD,
and
it
shall
be
the
priest's
that
sprinkleth
the
blood
of
the
peace
offerings.
007:015
And
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
of
his
peace
offerings
for
thanksgiving
shall
be
eaten
the
same
day
that
it
is
offered;
he
shall
not
leave
any
of
it
until
the
morning.
007:016
But
if
the
sacrifice
of
his
offering
be
a
vow,
or
a
voluntary
offering,
it
shall
be
eaten
the
same
day
that
he
offereth
his
sacrifice:
and
on
the
morrow
also
the
remainder
of
it
shall
be
eaten:
007:017
But
the
remainder
of
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
on
the
third
day
shall
be
burnt
with
fire.
007:018
And
if
any
of
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
of
his
peace
offerings
be
eaten
at
all
on
the
third
day,
it
shall
not
be
accepted,
neither
shall
it
be
imputed
unto
him
that
offereth
it:
it
shall
be
an
abomination,
and
the
soul
that
eateth
of
it
shall
bear
his
iniquity.
007:019
And
the
flesh
that
toucheth
any
unclean
thing
shall
not
be
eaten;
it
shall
be
burnt
with
fire:
and
as
for
the
flesh,
all
that
be
clean
shall
eat
thereof.
007:020
But
the
soul
that
eateth
of
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings,
that
pertain
unto
the
LORD,
having
his
uncleanness
upon
him,
even
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
people.
007:021
Moreover
the
soul
that
shall
touch
any
unclean
thing,
as
the
uncleanness
of
man,
or
any
unclean
beast,
or
any
abominable
unclean
thing,
and
eat
of
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings,
which
pertain
unto
the
LORD,
even
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
people.
007:022
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
007:023
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
Ye
shall
eat
no
manner
of
fat,
of
ox,
or
of
sheep,
or
of
goat.
007:024
And
the
fat
of
the
beast
that
dieth
of
itself,
and
the
fat
of
that
which
is
torn
with
beasts,
may
be
used
in
any
other
use:
but
ye
shall
in
no
wise
eat
of
it.
007:025
For
whosoever
eateth
the
fat
of
the
beast,
of
which
men
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD,
even
the
soul
that
eateth
it
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
people.
007:026
Moreover
ye
shall
eat
no
manner
of
blood,
whether
it
be
of
fowl
or
of
beast,
in
any
of
your
dwellings.
007:027
Whatsoever
soul
it
be
that
eateth
any
manner
of
blood,
even
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
people.
007:028
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
007:029
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
He
that
offereth
the
sacrifice
of
his
peace
offerings
unto
the
LORD
shall
bring
his
oblation
unto
the
LORD
of
the
sacrifice
of
his
peace
offerings.
007:030
His
own
hands
shall
bring
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire,
the
fat
with
the
breast,
it
shall
he
bring,
that
the
breast
may
be
waved
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD.
007:031
And
the
priest
shall
burn
the
fat
upon
the
altar:
but
the
breast
shall
be
Aaron's
and
his
sons'.
007:032
And
the
right
shoulder
shall
ye
give
unto
the
priest
for
an
heave
offering
of
the
sacrifices
of
your
peace
offerings.
007:033
He
among
the
sons
of
Aaron,
that
offereth
the
blood
of
the
peace
offerings,
and
the
fat,
shall
have
the
right
shoulder
for
his
part.
007:034
For
the
wave
breast
and
the
heave
shoulder
have
I
taken
of
the
children
of
Israel
from
off
the
sacrifices
of
their
peace
offerings,
and
have
given
them
unto
Aaron
the
priest
and
unto
his
sons
by
a
statute
for
ever
from
among
the
children
of
Israel.
007:035
This
is
the
portion
of
the
anointing
of
Aaron,
and
of
the
anointing
of
his
sons,
out
of
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire,
in
the
day
when
he
presented
them
to
minister
unto
the
LORD
in
the
priest's
office;
007:036
Which
the
LORD
commanded
to
be
given
them
of
the
children
of
Israel,
in
the
day
that
he
anointed
them,
by
a
statute
for
ever
throughout
their
generations.
007:037
This
is
the
law
of
the
burnt
offering,
of
the
meat
offering,
and
of
the
sin
offering,
and
of
the
trespass
offering,
and
of
the
consecrations,
and
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
peace
offerings;
007:038
Which
the
LORD
commanded
Moses
in
mount
Sinai,
in
the
day
that
he
commanded
the
children
of
Israel
to
offer
their
oblations
unto
the
LORD,
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai.
008:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
008:002
Take
Aaron
and
his
sons
with
him,
and
the
garments,
and
the
anointing
oil,
and
a
bullock
for
the
sin
offering,
and
two
rams,
and
a
basket
of
unleavened
bread;
008:003
And
gather
thou
all
the
congregation
together
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
008:004
And
Moses
did
as
the
LORD
commanded
him;
and
the
assembly
was
gathered
together
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
008:005
And
Moses
said
unto
the
congregation,
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
commanded
to
be
done.
008:006
And
Moses
brought
Aaron
and
his
sons,
and
washed
them
with
water.
008:007
And
he
put
upon
him
the
coat,
and
girded
him
with
the
girdle,
and
clothed
him
with
the
robe,
and
put
the
ephod
upon
him,
and
he
girded
him
with
the
curious
girdle
of
the
ephod,
and
bound
it
unto
him
therewith.
008:008
And
he
put
the
breastplate
upon
him:
also
he
put
in
the
breastplate
the
Urim
and
the
Thummim.
008:009
And
he
put
the
mitre
upon
his
head;
also
upon
the
mitre,
even
upon
his
forefront,
did
he
put
the
golden
plate,
the
holy
crown;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
008:010
And
Moses
took
the
anointing
oil,
and
anointed
the
tabernacle
and
all
that
was
therein,
and
sanctified
them.
008:011
And
he
sprinkled
thereof
upon
the
altar
seven
times,
and
anointed
the
altar
and
all
his
vessels,
both
the
laver
and
his
foot,
to
sanctify
them.
008:012
And
he
poured
of
the
anointing
oil
upon
Aaron's
head,
and
anointed
him,
to
sanctify
him.
008:013
And
Moses
brought
Aaron's
sons,
and
put
coats
upon
them,
and
girded
them
with
girdles,
and
put
bonnets
upon
them;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
008:014
And
he
brought
the
bullock
for
the
sin
offering:
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
laid
their
hands
upon
the
head
of
the
bullock
for
the
sin
offering.
008:015
And
he
slew
it;
and
Moses
took
the
blood,
and
put
it
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar
round
about
with
his
finger,
and
purified
the
altar,
and
poured
the
blood
at
the
bottom
of
the
altar,
and
sanctified
it,
to
make
reconciliation
upon
it.
008:016
And
he
took
all
the
fat
that
was
upon
the
inwards,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver,
and
the
two
kidneys,
and
their
fat,
and
Moses
burned
it
upon
the
altar.
008:017
But
the
bullock,
and
his
hide,
his
flesh,
and
his
dung,
he
burnt
with
fire
without
the
camp;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
008:018
And
he
brought
the
ram
for
the
burnt
offering:
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
laid
their
hands
upon
the
head
of
the
ram.
008:019
And
he
killed
it;
and
Moses
sprinkled
the
blood
upon
the
altar
round
about.
008:020
And
he
cut
the
ram
into
pieces;
and
Moses
burnt
the
head,
and
the
pieces,
and
the
fat.
008:021
And
he
washed
the
inwards
and
the
legs
in
water;
and
Moses
burnt
the
whole
ram
upon
the
altar:
it
was
a
burnt
sacrifice
for
a
sweet
savour,
and
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
008:022
And
he
brought
the
other
ram,
the
ram
of
consecration:
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
laid
their
hands
upon
the
head
of
the
ram.
008:023
And
he
slew
it;
and
Moses
took
of
the
blood
of
it,
and
put
it
upon
the
tip
of
Aaron's
right
ear,
and
upon
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand,
and
upon
the
great
toe
of
his
right
foot.
008:024
And
he
brought
Aaron's
sons,
and
Moses
put
of
the
blood
upon
the
tip
of
their
right
ear,
and
upon
the
thumbs
of
their
right
hands,
and
upon
the
great
toes
of
their
right
feet:
and
Moses
sprinkled
the
blood
upon
the
altar
round
about.
008:025
And
he
took
the
fat,
and
the
rump,
and
all
the
fat
that
was
upon
the
inwards,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver,
and
the
two
kidneys,
and
their
fat,
and
the
right
shoulder:
008:026
And
out
of
the
basket
of
unleavened
bread,
that
was
before
the
LORD,
he
took
one
unleavened
cake,
and
a
cake
of
oiled
bread,
and
one
wafer,
and
put
them
on
the
fat,
and
upon
the
right
shoulder:
008:027
And
he
put
all
upon
Aaron's
hands,
and
upon
his
sons'
hands,
and
waved
them
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD.
008:028
And
Moses
took
them
from
off
their
hands,
and
burnt
them
on
the
altar
upon
the
burnt
offering:
they
were
consecrations
for
a
sweet
savour:
it
is
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
008:029
And
Moses
took
the
breast,
and
waved
it
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD:
for
of
the
ram
of
consecration
it
was
Moses'
part;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
008:030
And
Moses
took
of
the
anointing
oil,
and
of
the
blood
which
was
upon
the
altar,
and
sprinkled
it
upon
Aaron,
and
upon
his
garments,
and
upon
his
sons,
and
upon
his
sons'
garments
with
him;
and
sanctified
Aaron,
and
his
garments,
and
his
sons,
and
his
sons'
garments
with
him.
008:031
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron
and
to
his
sons,
Boil
the
flesh
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
there
eat
it
with
the
bread
that
is
in
the
basket
of
consecrations,
as
I
commanded,
saying,
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
eat
it.
008:032
And
that
which
remaineth
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
bread
shall
ye
burn
with
fire.
008:033
And
ye
shall
not
go
out
of
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
in
seven
days,
until
the
days
of
your
consecration
be
at
an
end:
for
seven
days
shall
he
consecrate
you.
008:034
As
he
hath
done
this
day,
so
the
LORD
hath
commanded
to
do,
to
make
an
atonement
for
you.
008:035
Therefore
shall
ye
abide
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
day
and
night
seven
days,
and
keep
the
charge
of
the
LORD,
that
ye
die
not:
for
so
I
am
commanded.
008:036
So
Aaron
and
his
sons
did
all
things
which
the
LORD
commanded
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
009:001
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
eighth
day,
that
Moses
called
Aaron
and
his
sons,
and
the
elders
of
Israel;
009:002
And
he
said
unto
Aaron,
Take
thee
a
young
calf
for
a
sin
offering,
and
a
ram
for
a
burnt
offering,
without
blemish,
and
offer
them
before
the
LORD.
009:003
And
unto
the
children
of
Israel
thou
shalt
speak,
saying,
Take
ye
a
kid
of
the
goats
for
a
sin
offering;
and
a
calf
and
a
lamb,
both
of
the
first
year,
without
blemish,
for
a
burnt
offering;
009:004
Also
a
bullock
and
a
ram
for
peace
offerings,
to
sacrifice
before
the
LORD;
and
a
meat
offering
mingled
with
oil:
for
to
day
the
LORD
will
appear
unto
you.
009:005
And
they
brought
that
which
Moses
commanded
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
all
the
congregation
drew
near
and
stood
before
the
LORD.
009:006
And
Moses
said,
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
commanded
that
ye
should
do:
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
shall
appear
unto
you.
009:007
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron,
Go
unto
the
altar,
and
offer
thy
sin
offering,
and
thy
burnt
offering,
and
make
an
atonement
for
thyself,
and
for
the
people:
and
offer
the
offering
of
the
people,
and
make
an
atonement
for
them;
as
the
LORD
commanded.
009:008
Aaron
therefore
went
unto
the
altar,
and
slew
the
calf
of
the
sin
offering,
which
was
for
himself.
009:009
And
the
sons
of
Aaron
brought
the
blood
unto
him:
and
he
dipped
his
finger
in
the
blood,
and
put
it
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar,
and
poured
out
the
blood
at
the
bottom
of
the
altar:
009:010
But
the
fat,
and
the
kidneys,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver
of
the
sin
offering,
he
burnt
upon
the
altar;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
009:011
And
the
flesh
and
the
hide
he
burnt
with
fire
without
the
camp.
009:012
And
he
slew
the
burnt
offering;
and
Aaron's
sons
presented
unto
him
the
blood,
which
he
sprinkled
round
about
upon
the
altar.
009:013
And
they
presented
the
burnt
offering
unto
him,
with
the
pieces
thereof,
and
the
head:
and
he
burnt
them
upon
the
altar.
009:014
And
he
did
wash
the
inwards
and
the
legs,
and
burnt
them
upon
the
burnt
offering
on
the
altar.
009:015
And
he
brought
the
people's
offering,
and
took
the
goat,
which
was
the
sin
offering
for
the
people,
and
slew
it,
and
offered
it
for
sin,
as
the
first.
009:016
And
he
brought
the
burnt
offering,
and
offered
it
according
to
the
manner.
009:017
And
he
brought
the
meat
offering,
and
took
an
handful
thereof,
and
burnt
it
upon
the
altar,
beside
the
burnt
sacrifice
of
the
morning.
009:018
He
slew
also
the
bullock
and
the
ram
for
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings,
which
was
for
the
people:
and
Aaron's
sons
presented
unto
him
the
blood,
which
he
sprinkled
upon
the
altar
round
about,
009:019
And
the
fat
of
the
bullock
and
of
the
ram,
the
rump,
and
that
which
covereth
the
inwards,
and
the
kidneys,
and
the
caul
above
the
liver:
009:020
And
they
put
the
fat
upon
the
breasts,
and
he
burnt
the
fat
upon
the
altar:
009:021
And
the
breasts
and
the
right
shoulder
Aaron
waved
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD;
as
Moses
commanded.
009:022
And
Aaron
lifted
up
his
hand
toward
the
people,
and
blessed
them,
and
came
down
from
offering
of
the
sin
offering,
and
the
burnt
offering,
and
peace
offerings.
009:023
And
Moses
and
Aaron
went
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
came
out,
and
blessed
the
people:
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
all
the
people.
009:024
And
there
came
a
fire
out
from
before
the
LORD,
and
consumed
upon
the
altar
the
burnt
offering
and
the
fat:
which
when
all
the
people
saw,
they
shouted,
and
fell
on
their
faces.
010:001
And
Nadab
and
Abihu,
the
sons
of
Aaron,
took
either
of
them
his
censer,
and
put
fire
therein,
and
put
incense
thereon,
and
offered
strange
fire
before
the
LORD,
which
he
commanded
them
not.
010:002
And
there
went
out
fire
from
the
LORD,
and
devoured
them,
and
they
died
before
the
LORD.
010:003
Then
Moses
said
unto
Aaron,
This
is
it
that
the
LORD
spake,
saying,
I
will
be
sanctified
in
them
that
come
nigh
me,
and
before
all
the
people
I
will
be
glorified.
And
Aaron
held
his
peace.
010:004
And
Moses
called
Mishael
and
Elzaphan,
the
sons
of
Uzziel
the
uncle
of
Aaron,
and
said
unto
them,
Come
near,
carry
your
brethren
from
before
the
sanctuary
out
of
the
camp.
010:005
So
they
went
near,
and
carried
them
in
their
coats
out
of
the
camp;
as
Moses
had
said.
010:006
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron,
and
unto
Eleazar
and
unto
Ithamar,
his
sons,
Uncover
not
your
heads,
neither
rend
your
clothes;
lest
ye
die,
and
lest
wrath
come
upon
all
the
people:
but
let
your
brethren,
the
whole
house
of
Israel,
bewail
the
burning
which
the
LORD
hath
kindled.
010:007
And
ye
shall
not
go
out
from
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
lest
ye
die:
for
the
anointing
oil
of
the
LORD
is
upon
you.
And
they
did
according
to
the
word
of
Moses.
010:008
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Aaron,
saying,
010:009
Do
not
drink
wine
nor
strong
drink,
thou,
nor
thy
sons
with
thee,
when
ye
go
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
lest
ye
die:
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
throughout
your
generations:
010:010
And
that
ye
may
put
difference
between
holy
and
unholy,
and
between
unclean
and
clean;
010:011
And
that
ye
may
teach
the
children
of
Israel
all
the
statutes
which
the
LORD
hath
spoken
unto
them
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
010:012
And
Moses
spake
unto
Aaron,
and
unto
Eleazar
and
unto
Ithamar,
his
sons
that
were
left,
Take
the
meat
offering
that
remaineth
of
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire,
and
eat
it
without
leaven
beside
the
altar:
for
it
is
most
holy:
010:013
And
ye
shall
eat
it
in
the
holy
place,
because
it
is
thy
due,
and
thy
sons'
due,
of
the
sacrifices
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire:
for
so
I
am
commanded.
010:014
And
the
wave
breast
and
heave
shoulder
shall
ye
eat
in
a
clean
place;
thou,
and
thy
sons,
and
thy
daughters
with
thee:
for
they
be
thy
due,
and
thy
sons'
due,
which
are
given
out
of
the
sacrifices
of
peace
offerings
of
the
children
of
Israel.
010:015
The
heave
shoulder
and
the
wave
breast
shall
they
bring
with
the
offerings
made
by
fire
of
the
fat,
to
wave
it
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD;
and
it
shall
be
thine,
and
thy
sons'
with
thee,
by
a
statute
for
ever;
as
the
LORD
hath
commanded.
010:016
And
Moses
diligently
sought
the
goat
of
the
sin
offering,
and,
behold,
it
was
burnt:
and
he
was
angry
with
Eleazar
and
Ithamar,
the
sons
of
Aaron
which
were
left
alive,
saying,
010:017
Wherefore
have
ye
not
eaten
the
sin
offering
in
the
holy
place,
seeing
it
is
most
holy,
and
God
hath
given
it
you
to
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
congregation,
to
make
atonement
for
them
before
the
LORD?
010:018
Behold,
the
blood
of
it
was
not
brought
in
within
the
holy
place:
ye
should
indeed
have
eaten
it
in
the
holy
place,
as
I
commanded.
010:019
And
Aaron
said
unto
Moses,
Behold,
this
day
have
they
offered
their
sin
offering
and
their
burnt
offering
before
the
LORD;
and
such
things
have
befallen
me:
and
if
I
had
eaten
the
sin
offering
to
day,
should
it
have
been
accepted
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD?
010:020
And
when
Moses
heard
that,
he
was
content.
011:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
to
Aaron,
saying
unto
them,
011:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
These
are
the
beasts
which
ye
shall
eat
among
all
the
beasts
that
are
on
the
earth.
011:003
Whatsoever
parteth
the
hoof,
and
is
clovenfooted,
and
cheweth
the
cud,
among
the
beasts,
that
shall
ye
eat.
011:004
Nevertheless
these
shall
ye
not
eat
of
them
that
chew
the
cud,
or
of
them
that
divide
the
hoof:
as
the
camel,
because
he
cheweth
the
cud,
but
divideth
not
the
hoof;
he
is
unclean
unto
you.
011:005
And
the
coney,
because
he
cheweth
the
cud,
but
divideth
not
the
hoof;
he
is
unclean
unto
you.
011:006
And
the
hare,
because
he
cheweth
the
cud,
but
divideth
not
the
hoof;
he
is
unclean
unto
you.
011:007
And
the
swine,
though
he
divide
the
hoof,
and
be
clovenfooted,
yet
he
cheweth
not
the
cud;
he
is
unclean
to
you.
011:008
Of
their
flesh
shall
ye
not
eat,
and
their
carcase
shall
ye
not
touch;
they
are
unclean
to
you.
011:009
