in
the
faith
which
is
in
Christ
Jesus.
003:014
These
things
write
I
unto
thee,
hoping
to
come
unto
thee
shortly:
003:015
But
if
I
tarry
long,
that
thou
mayest
know
how
thou
oughtest
to
behave
thyself
in
the
house
of
God,
which
is
the
church
of
the
living
God,
the
pillar
and
ground
of
the
truth.
003:016
And
without
controversy
great
is
the
mystery
of
godliness:
God
was
manifest
in
the
flesh,
justified
in
the
Spirit,
seen
of
angels,
preached
unto
the
Gentiles,
believed
on
in
the
world,
received
up
into
glory.
004:001
Now
the
Spirit
speaketh
expressly,
that
in
the
latter
times
some
shall
depart
from
the
faith,
giving
heed
to
seducing
spirits,
and
doctrines
of
devils;
004:002
Speaking
lies
in
hypocrisy;
having
their
conscience
seared
with
a
hot
iron;
004:003
Forbidding
to
marry,
and
commanding
to
abstain
from
meats,
which
God
hath
created
to
be
received
with
thanksgiving
of
them
which
believe
and
know
the
truth.
004:004
For
every
creature
of
God
is
good,
and
nothing
to
be
refused,
if
it
be
received
with
thanksgiving:
004:005
For
it
is
sanctified
by
the
word
of
God
and
prayer.
004:006
If
thou
put
the
brethren
in
remembrance
of
these
things,
thou
shalt
be
a
good
minister
of
Jesus
Christ,
nourished
up
in
the
words
of
faith
and
of
good
doctrine,
whereunto
thou
hast
attained.
004:007
But
refuse
profane
and
old
wives'
fables,
and
exercise
thyself
rather
unto
godliness.
004:008
For
bodily
exercise
profiteth
little:
but
godliness
is
profitable
unto
all
things,
having
promise
of
the
life
that
now
is,
and
of
that
which
is
to
come.
004:009
This
is
a
faithful
saying
and
worthy
of
all
acceptation.
004:010
For
therefore
we
both
labour
and
suffer
reproach,
because
we
trust
in
the
living
God,
who
is
the
Saviour
of
all
men,
specially
of
those
that
believe.
004:011
These
things
command
and
teach.
004:012
Let
no
man
despise
thy
youth;
but
be
thou
an
example
of
the
believers,
in
word,
in
conversation,
in
charity,
in
spirit,
in
faith,
in
purity.
004:013
Till
I
come,
give
attendance
to
reading,
to
exhortation,
to
doctrine.
004:014
Neglect
not
the
gift
that
is
in
thee,
which
was
given
thee
by
prophecy,
with
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
the
presbytery.
004:015
Meditate
upon
these
things;
give
thyself
wholly
to
them;
that
thy
profiting
may
appear
to
all.
004:016
Take
heed
unto
thyself,
and
unto
the
doctrine;
continue
in
them:
for
in
doing
this
thou
shalt
both
save
thyself,
and
them
that
hear
thee.
005:001
Rebuke
not
an
elder,
but
intreat
him
as
a
father;
and
the
younger
men
as
brethren;
005:002
The
elder
women
as
mothers;
the
younger
as
sisters,
with
all
purity.
005:003
Honour
widows
that
are
widows
indeed.
005:004
But
if
any
widow
have
children
or
nephews,
let
them
learn
first
to
shew
piety
at
home,
and
to
requite
their
parents:
for
that
is
good
and
acceptable
before
God.
005:005
Now
she
that
is
a
widow
indeed,
and
desolate,
trusteth
in
God,
and
continueth
in
supplications
and
prayers
night
and
day.
005:006
But
she
that
liveth
in
pleasure
is
dead
while
she
liveth.
005:007
And
these
things
give
in
charge,
that
they
may
be
blameless.
005:008
But
if
any
provide
not
for
his
own,
and
specially
for
those
of
his
own
house,
he
hath
denied
the
faith,
and
is
worse
than
an
infidel.
005:009
Let
not
a
widow
be
taken
into
the
number
under
threescore
years
old,
having
been
the
wife
of
one
man.
005:010
Well
reported
of
for
good
works;
if
she
have
brought
up
children,
if
she
have
lodged
strangers,
if
she
have
washed
the
saints'
feet,
if
she
have
relieved
the
afflicted,
if
she
have
diligently
followed
every
good
work.
005:011
But
the
younger
widows
refuse:
for
when
they
have
begun
to
wax
wanton
against
Christ,
they
will
marry;
005:012
Having
damnation,
because
they
have
cast
off
their
first
faith.
005:013
And
withal
they
learn
to
be
idle,
wandering
about
from
house
to
house;
and
not
only
idle,
but
tattlers
also
and
busybodies,
speaking
things
which
they
ought
not.
005:014
I
will
therefore
that
the
younger
women
marry,
bear
children,
guide
the
house,
give
none
occasion
to
the
adversary
to
speak
reproachfully.
005:015
For
some
are
already
turned
aside
after
Satan.
005:016
If
any
man
or
woman
that
believeth
have
widows,
let
them
relieve
them,
and
let
not
the
church
be
charged;
that
it
may
relieve
them
that
are
widows
indeed.
005:017
Let
the
elders
that
rule
well
be
counted
worthy
of
double
honour,
especially
they
who
labour
in
the
word
and
doctrine.
005:018
For
the
scripture
saith,
Thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn.
And,
The
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
reward.
005:019
Against
an
elder
receive
not
an
accusation,
but
before
two
or
three
witnesses.
005:020
Them
that
sin
rebuke
before
all,
that
others
also
may
fear.
005:021
I
charge
thee
before
God,
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
and
the
elect
angels,
that
thou
observe
these
things
without
preferring
one
before
another,
doing
nothing
by
partiality.
005:022
Lay
hands
suddenly
on
no
man,
neither
be
partaker
of
other
men's
sins:
keep
thyself
pure.
005:023
Drink
no
longer
water,
but
use
a
little
wine
for
thy
stomach's
sake
and
thine
often
infirmities.
005:024
Some
men's
sins
are
open
beforehand,
going
before
to
judgment;
and
some
men
they
follow
after.
005:025
Likewise
also
the
good
works
of
some
are
manifest
beforehand;
and
they
that
are
otherwise
cannot
be
hid.
006:001
Let
as
many
servants
as
are
under
the
yoke
count
their
own
masters
worthy
of
all
honour,
that
the
name
of
God
and
his
doctrine
be
not
blasphemed.
006:002
And
they
that
have
believing
masters,
let
them
not
despise
them,
because
they
are
brethren;
but
rather
do
them
service,
because
they
are
faithful
and
beloved,
partakers
of
the
benefit.
These
things
teach
and
exhort.
006:003
If
any
man
teach
otherwise,
and
consent
not
to
wholesome
words,
even
the
words
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
and
to
the
doctrine
which
is
according
to
godliness;
006:004
He
is
proud,
knowing
nothing,
but
doting
about
questions
and
strifes
of
words,
whereof
cometh
envy,
strife,
railings,
evil
surmisings,
006:005
Perverse
disputings
of
men
of
corrupt
minds,
and
destitute
of
the
truth,
supposing
that
gain
is
godliness:
from
such
withdraw
thyself.
006:006
But
godliness
with
contentment
is
great
gain.
006:007
For
we
brought
nothing
into
this
world,
and
it
is
certain
we
can
carry
nothing
out.
006:008
And
having
food
and
raiment
let
us
be
therewith
content.
006:009
But
they
that
will
be
rich
fall
into
temptation
and
a
snare,
and
into
many
foolish
and
hurtful
lusts,
which
drown
men
in
destruction
and
perdition.
006:010
For
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil:
which
while
some
coveted
after,
they
have
erred
from
the
faith,
and
pierced
themselves
through
with
many
sorrows.
006:011
But
thou,
O
man
of
God,
flee
these
things;
and
follow
after
righteousness,
godliness,
faith,
love,
patience,
meekness.
006:012
Fight
the
good
fight
of
faith,
lay
hold
on
eternal
life,
whereunto
thou
art
also
called,
and
hast
professed
a
good
profession
before
many
witnesses.
006:013
I
give
thee
charge
in
the
sight
of
God,
who
quickeneth
all
things,
and
before
Christ
Jesus,
who
before
Pontius
Pilate
witnessed
a
good
confession;
006:014
That
thou
keep
this
commandment
without
spot,
unrebukable,
until
the
appearing
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ:
006:015
Which
in
his
times
he
shall
shew,
who
is
the
blessed
and
only
Potentate,
the
King
of
kings,
and
Lord
of
lords;
006:016
Who
only
hath
immortality,
dwelling
in
the
light
which
no
man
can
approach
unto;
whom
no
man
hath
seen,
nor
can
see:
to
whom
be
honour
and
power
everlasting.
Amen.
006:017
Charge
them
that
are
rich
in
this
world,
that
they
be
not
highminded,
nor
trust
in
uncertain
riches,
but
in
the
living
God,
who
giveth
us
richly
all
things
to
enjoy;
006:018
That
they
do
good,
that
they
be
rich
in
good
works,
ready
to
distribute,
willing
to
communicate;
006:019
Laying
up
in
store
for
themselves
a
good
foundation
against
the
time
to
come,
that
they
may
lay
hold
on
eternal
life.
006:020
O
Timothy,
keep
that
which
is
committed
to
thy
trust,
avoiding
profane
and
vain
babblings,
and
oppositions
of
science
falsely
so
called:
006:021
Which
some
professing
have
erred
concerning
the
faith.
Grace
be
with
thee.
Amen.
Book
55	2
Timothy
001:001
Paul,
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ
by
the
will
of
God,
according
to
the
promise
of
life
which
is
in
Christ
Jesus,
001:002
To
Timothy,
my
dearly
beloved
son:
Grace,
mercy,
and
peace,
from
God
the
Father
and
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord.
001:003
I
thank
God,
whom
I
serve
from
my
forefathers
with
pure
conscience,
that
without
ceasing
I
have
remembrance
of
thee
in
my
prayers
night
and
day;
001:004
Greatly
desiring
to
see
thee,
being
mindful
of
thy
tears,
that
I
may
be
filled
with
joy;
001:005
When
I
call
to
remembrance
the
unfeigned
faith
that
is
in
thee,
which
dwelt
first
in
thy
grandmother
Lois,
and
thy
mother
Eunice;
and
I
am
persuaded
that
in
thee
also.
001:006
Wherefore
I
put
thee
in
remembrance
that
thou
stir
up
the
gift
of
God,
which
is
in
thee
by
the
putting
on
of
my
hands.
001:007
For
God
hath
not
given
us
the
spirit
of
fear;
but
of
power,
and
of
love,
and
of
a
sound
mind.
001:008
Be
not
thou
therefore
ashamed
of
the
testimony
of
our
Lord,
nor
of
me
his
prisoner:
but
be
thou
partaker
of
the
afflictions
of
the
gospel
according
to
the
power
of
God;
001:009
Who
hath
saved
us,
and
called
us
with
an
holy
calling,
not
according
to
our
works,
but
according
to
his
own
purpose
and
grace,
which
was
given
us
in
Christ
Jesus
before
the
world
began,
001:010
But
is
now
made
manifest
by
the
appearing
of
our
Saviour
Jesus
Christ,
who
hath
abolished
death,
and
hath
brought
life
and
immortality
to
light
through
the
gospel:
001:011
Whereunto
I
am
appointed
a
preacher,
and
an
apostle,
and
a
teacher
of
the
Gentiles.
001:012
For
the
which
cause
I
also
suffer
these
things:
nevertheless
I
am
not
ashamed:
for
I
know
whom
I
have
believed,
and
am
persuaded
that
he
is
able
to
keep
that
which
I
have
committed
unto
him
against
that
day.
001:013
Hold
fast
the
form
of
sound
words,
which
thou
hast
heard
of
me,
in
faith
and
love
which
is
in
Christ
Jesus.
001:014
That
good
thing
which
was
committed
unto
thee
keep
by
the
Holy
Ghost
which
dwelleth
in
us.
001:015
This
thou
knowest,
that
all
they
which
are
in
Asia
be
turned
away
from
me;
of
whom
are
Phygellus
and
Hermogenes.
001:016
The
Lord
give
mercy
unto
the
house
of
Onesiphorus;
for
he
oft
refreshed
me,
and
was
not
ashamed
of
my
chain:
001:017
But,
when
he
was
in
Rome,
he
sought
me
out
very
diligently,
and
found
me.
001:018
The
Lord
grant
unto
him
that
he
may
find
mercy
of
the
Lord
in
that
day:
and
in
how
many
things
he
ministered
unto
me
at
Ephesus,
thou
knowest
very
well.
002:001
Thou
therefore,
my
son,
be
strong
in
the
grace
that
is
in
Christ
Jesus.
002:002
And
the
things
that
thou
hast
heard
of
me
among
many
witnesses,
the
same
commit
thou
to
faithful
men,
who
shall
be
able
to
teach
others
also.
002:003
Thou
therefore
endure
hardness,
as
a
good
soldier
of
Jesus
Christ.
002:004
No
man
that
warreth
entangleth
himself
with
the
affairs
of
this
life;
that
he
may
please
him
who
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
soldier.
002:005
And
if
a
man
also
strive
for
masteries,
yet
is
he
not
crowned,
except
he
strive
lawfully.
002:006
The
husbandman
that
laboureth
must
be
first
partaker
of
the
fruits.
002:007
Consider
what
I
say;
and
the
Lord
give
thee
understanding
in
all
things.
002:008
Remember
that
Jesus
Christ
of
the
seed
of
David
was
raised
from
the
dead
according
to
my
gospel:
002:009
Wherein
I
suffer
trouble,
as
an
evil
doer,
even
unto
bonds;
but
the
word
of
God
is
not
bound.
002:010
Therefore
I
endure
all
things
for
the
elect's
sakes,
that
they
may
also
obtain
the
salvation
which
is
in
Christ
Jesus
with
eternal
glory.
002:011
It
is
a
faithful
saying:
For
if
we
be
dead
with
him,
we
shall
also
live
with
him:
002:012
If
we
suffer,
we
shall
also
reign
with
him:
if
we
deny
him,
he
also
will
deny
us:
002:013
If
we
believe
not,
yet
he
abideth
faithful:
he
cannot
deny
himself.
002:014
Of
these
things
put
them
in
remembrance,
charging
them
before
the
Lord
that
they
strive
not
about
words
to
no
profit,
but
to
the
subverting
of
the
hearers.
002:015
Study
to
shew
thyself
approved
unto
God,
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed,
rightly
dividing
the
word
of
truth.
002:016
But
shun
profane
and
vain
babblings:
for
they
will
increase
unto
more
ungodliness.
002:017
And
their
word
will
eat
as
doth
a
canker:
of
whom
is
Hymenaeus
and
Philetus;
002:018
Who
concerning
the
truth
have
erred,
saying
that
the
resurrection
is
past
already;
and
overthrow
the
faith
of
some.
002:019
Nevertheless
the
foundation
of
God
standeth
sure,
having
this
seal,
The
Lord
knoweth
them
that
are
his.
And,
Let
every
one
that
nameth
the
name
of
Christ
depart
from
iniquity.
002:020
But
in
a
great
house
there
are
not
only
vessels
of
gold
and
of
silver,
but
also
of
wood
and
of
earth;
and
some
to
honour,
and
some
to
dishonour.
002:021
If
a
man
therefore
purge
himself
from
these,
he
shall
be
a
vessel
unto
honour,
sanctified,
and
meet
for
the
master's
use,
and
prepared
unto
every
good
work.
002:022
Flee
also
youthful
lusts:
but
follow
righteousness,
faith,
charity,
peace,
with
them
that
call
on
the
Lord
out
of
a
pure
heart.
002:023
But
foolish
and
unlearned
questions
avoid,
knowing
that
they
do
gender
strifes.
002:024
And
the
servant
of
the
Lord
must
not
strive;
but
be
gentle
unto
all
men,
apt
to
teach,
patient,
002:025
In
meekness
instructing
those
that
oppose
themselves;
if
God
peradventure
will
give
them
repentance
to
the
acknowledging
of
the
truth;
002:026
And
that
they
may
recover
themselves
out
of
the
snare
of
the
devil,
who
are
taken
captive
by
him
at
his
will.
003:001
This
know
also,
that
in
the
last
days
perilous
times
shall
come.
003:002
For
men
shall
be
lovers
of
their
own
selves,
covetous,
boasters,
proud,
blasphemers,
disobedient
to
parents,
unthankful,
unholy,
003:003
Without
natural
affection,
trucebreakers,
false
accusers,
incontinent,
fierce,
despisers
of
those
that
are
good,
003:004
Traitors,
heady,
highminded,
lovers
of
pleasures
more
than
lovers
of
God;
003:005
Having
a
form
of
godliness,
but
denying
the
power
thereof:
from
such
turn
away.
003:006
For
of
this
sort
are
they
which
creep
into
houses,
and
lead
captive
silly
women
laden
with
sins,
led
away
with
divers
lusts,
003:007
Ever
learning,
and
never
able
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth.
003:008
Now
as
Jannes
and
Jambres
withstood
Moses,
so
do
these
also
resist
the
truth:
men
of
corrupt
minds,
reprobate
concerning
the
faith.
003:009
But
they
shall
proceed
no
further:
for
their
folly
shall
be
manifest
unto
all
men,
as
their's
also
was.
003:010
But
thou
hast
fully
known
my
doctrine,
manner
of
life,
purpose,
faith,
longsuffering,
charity,
patience,
003:011
Persecutions,
afflictions,
which
came
unto
me
at
Antioch,
at
Iconium,
at
Lystra;
what
persecutions
I
endured:
but
out
of
them
all
the
Lord
delivered
me.
003:012
Yea,
and
all
that
will
live
godly
in
Christ
Jesus
shall
suffer
persecution.
003:013
But
evil
men
and
seducers
shall
wax
worse
and
worse,
deceiving,
and
being
deceived.
003:014
But
continue
thou
in
the
things
which
thou
hast
learned
and
hast
been
assured
of,
knowing
of
whom
thou
hast
learned
them;
003:015
And
that
from
a
child
thou
hast
known
the
holy
scriptures,
which
are
able
to
make
thee
wise
unto
salvation
through
faith
which
is
in
Christ
Jesus.
003:016
All
scripture
is
given
by
inspiration
of
God,
and
is
profitable
for
doctrine,
for
reproof,
for
correction,
for
instruction
in
righteousness:
003:017
That
the
man
of
God
may
be
perfect,
throughly
furnished
unto
all
good
works.
004:001
I
charge
thee
therefore
before
God,
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
who
shall
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
at
his
appearing
and
his
kingdom;
004:002
Preach
the
word;
be
instant
in
season,
out
of
season;
reprove,
rebuke,
exhort
with
all
longsuffering
and
doctrine.
004:003
For
the
time
will
come
when
they
will
not
endure
sound
doctrine;
but
after
their
own
lusts
shall
they
heap
to
themselves
teachers,
having
itching
ears;
004:004
And
they
shall
turn
away
their
ears
from
the
truth,
and
shall
be
turned
unto
fables.
004:005
But
watch
thou
in
all
things,
endure
afflictions,
do
the
work
of
an
evangelist,
make
full
proof
of
thy
ministry.
004:006
For
I
am
now
ready
to
be
offered,
and
the
time
of
my
departure
is
at
hand.
004:007
I
have
fought
a
good
fight,
I
have
finished
my
course,
I
have
kept
the
faith:
004:008
Henceforth
there
is
laid
up
for
me
a
crown
of
righteousness,
which
the
Lord,
the
righteous
judge,
shall
give
me
at
that
day:
and
not
to
me
only,
but
unto
all
them
also
that
love
his
appearing.
004:009
Do
thy
diligence
to
come
shortly
unto
me:
004:010
For
Demas
hath
forsaken
me,
having
loved
this
present
world,
and
is
departed
unto
Thessalonica;
Crescens
to
Galatia,
Titus
unto
Dalmatia.
004:011
Only
Luke
is
with
me.
Take
Mark,
and
bring
him
with
thee:
for
he
is
profitable
to
me
for
the
ministry.
004:012
And
Tychicus
have
I
sent
to
Ephesus.
004:013
The
cloke
that
I
left
at
Troas
with
Carpus,
when
thou
comest,
bring
with
thee,
and
the
books,
but
especially
the
parchments.
004:014
Alexander
the
coppersmith
did
me
much
evil:
the
Lord
reward
him
according
to
his
works:
004:015
Of
whom
be
thou
ware
also;
for
he
hath
greatly
withstood
our
words.
004:016
At
my
first
answer
no
man
stood
with
me,
but
all
men
forsook
me:
I
pray
God
that
it
may
not
be
laid
to
their
charge.
004:017
Notwithstanding
the
Lord
stood
with
me,
and
strengthened
me;
that
by
me
the
preaching
might
be
fully
known,
and
that
all
the
Gentiles
might
hear:
and
I
was
delivered
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lion.
004:018
And
the
Lord
shall
deliver
me
from
every
evil
work,
and
will
preserve
me
unto
his
heavenly
kingdom:
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever.
Amen.
004:019
Salute
Prisca
and
Aquila,
and
the
household
of
Onesiphorus.
004:020
Erastus
abode
at
Corinth:
but
Trophimus
have
I
left
at
Miletum
sick.
004:021
Do
thy
diligence
to
come
before
winter.
Eubulus
greeteth
thee,
and
Pudens,
and
Linus,
and
Claudia,
and
all
the
brethren.
004:022
The
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
thy
spirit.
Grace
be
with
you.
Amen.
Book
56	Titus
001:001
Paul,
a
servant
of
God,
and
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ,
according
to
the
faith
of
God's
elect,
and
the
acknowledging
of
the
truth
which
is
after
godliness;
001:002
In
hope
of
eternal
life,
which
God,
that
cannot
lie,
promised
before
the
world
began;
001:003
But
hath
in
due
times
manifested
his
word
through
preaching,
which
is
committed
unto
me
according
to
the
commandment
of
God
our
Saviour;
001:004
To
Titus,
mine
own
son
after
the
common
faith:
Grace,
mercy,
and
peace,
from
God
the
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
our
Saviour.
001:005
For
this
cause
left
I
thee
in
Crete,
that
thou
shouldest
set
in
order
the
things
that
are
wanting,
and
ordain
elders
in
every
city,
as
I
had
appointed
thee:
001:006
If
any
be
blameless,
the
husband
of
one
wife,
having
faithful
children
not
accused
of
riot
or
unruly.
001:007
For
a
bishop
must
be
blameless,
as
the
steward
of
God;
not
selfwilled,
not
soon
angry,
not
given
to
wine,
no
striker,
not
given
to
filthy
lucre;
001:008
But
a
lover
of
hospitality,
a
lover
of
good
men,
sober,
just,
holy,
temperate;
001:009
Holding
fast
the
faithful
word
as
he
hath
been
taught,
that
he
may
be
able
by
sound
doctrine
both
to
exhort
and
to
convince
the
gainsayers.
001:010
For
there
are
many
unruly
and
vain
talkers
and
deceivers,
specially
they
of
the
circumcision:
001:011
Whose
mouths
must
be
stopped,
who
subvert
whole
houses,
teaching
things
which
they
ought
not,
for
filthy
lucre's
sake.
001:012
One
of
themselves,
even
a
prophet
of
their
own,
said,
The
Cretians
are
alway
liars,
evil
beasts,
slow
bellies.
001:013
This
witness
is
true.
Wherefore
rebuke
them
sharply,
that
they
may
be
sound
in
the
faith;
001:014
Not
giving
heed
to
Jewish
fables,
and
commandments
of
men,
that
turn
from
the
truth.
001:015
Unto
the
pure
all
things
are
pure:
but
unto
them
that
are
defiled
and
unbelieving
is
nothing
pure;
but
even
their
mind
and
conscience
is
defiled.
001:016
They
profess
that
they
know
God;
but
in
works
they
deny
him,
being
abominable,
and
disobedient,
and
unto
every
good
work
reprobate.
002:001
But
speak
thou
the
things
which
become
sound
doctrine:
002:002
That
the
aged
men
be
sober,
grave,
temperate,
sound
in
faith,
in
charity,
in
patience.
002:003
The
aged
women
likewise,
that
they
be
in
behaviour
as
becometh
holiness,
not
false
accusers,
not
given
to
much
wine,
teachers
of
good
things;
002:004
That
they
may
teach
the
young
women
to
be
sober,
to
love
their
husbands,
to
love
their
children,
002:005
To
be
discreet,
chaste,
keepers
at
home,
good,
obedient
to
their
own
husbands,
that
the
word
of
God
be
not
blasphemed.
002:006
Young
men
likewise
exhort
to
be
sober
minded.
002:007
In
all
things
shewing
thyself
a
pattern
of
good
works:
in
doctrine
shewing
uncorruptness,
gravity,
sincerity,
002:008
Sound
speech,
that
cannot
be
condemned;
that
he
that
is
of
the
contrary
part
may
be
ashamed,
having
no
evil
thing
to
say
of
you.
002:009
Exhort
servants
to
be
obedient
unto
their
own
masters,
and
to
please
them
well
in
all
things;
not
answering
again;
002:010
Not
purloining,
but
shewing
all
good
fidelity;
that
they
may
adorn
the
doctrine
of
God
our
Saviour
in
all
things.
002:011
For
the
grace
of
God
that
bringeth
salvation
hath
appeared
to
all
men,
002:012
Teaching
us
that,
denying
ungodliness
and
worldly
lusts,
we
should
live
soberly,
righteously,
and
godly,
in
this
present
world;
002:013
Looking
for
that
blessed
hope,
and
the
glorious
appearing
of
the
great
God
and
our
Saviour
Jesus
Christ;
002:014
Who
gave
himself
for
us,
that
he
might
redeem
us
from
all
iniquity,
and
purify
unto
himself
a
peculiar
people,
zealous
of
good
works.
002:015
These
things
speak,
and
exhort,
and
rebuke
with
all
authority.
Let
no
man
despise
thee.
003:001
Put
them
in
mind
to
be
subject
to
principalities
and
powers,
to
obey
magistrates,
to
be
ready
to
every
good
work,
003:002
To
speak
evil
of
no
man,
to
be
no
brawlers,
but
gentle,
shewing
all
meekness
unto
all
men.
003:003
For
we
ourselves
also
were
sometimes
foolish,
disobedient,
deceived,
serving
divers
lusts
and
pleasures,
living
in
malice
and
envy,
hateful,
and
hating
one
another.
003:004
But
after
that
the
kindness
and
love
of
God
our
Saviour
toward
man
appeared,
003:005
Not
by
works
of
righteousness
which
we
have
done,
but
according
to
his
mercy
he
saved
us,
by
the
washing
of
regeneration,
and
renewing
of
the
Holy
Ghost;
003:006
Which
he
shed
on
us
abundantly
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Saviour;
003:007
That
being
justified
by
his
grace,
we
should
be
made
heirs
according
to
the
hope
of
eternal
life.
003:008
This
is
a
faithful
saying,
and
these
things
I
will
that
thou
affirm
constantly,
that
they
which
have
believed
in
God
might
be
careful
to
maintain
good
works.
These
things
are
good
and
profitable
unto
men.
003:009
But
avoid
foolish
questions,
and
genealogies,
and
contentions,
and
strivings
about
the
law;
for
they
are
unprofitable
and
vain.
003:010
A
man
that
is
an
heretick
after
the
first
and
second
admonition
reject;
003:011
Knowing
that
he
that
is
such
is
subverted,
and
sinneth,
being
condemned
of
himself.
003:012
When
I
shall
send
Artemas
unto
thee,
or
Tychicus,
be
diligent
to
come
unto
me
to
Nicopolis:
for
I
have
determined
there
to
winter.
003:013
Bring
Zenas
the
lawyer
and
Apollos
on
their
journey
diligently,
that
nothing
be
wanting
unto
them.
003:014
And
let
our's
also
learn
to
maintain
good
works
for
necessary
uses,
that
they
be
not
unfruitful.
003:015
All
that
are
with
me
salute
thee.
Greet
them
that
love
us
in
the
faith.
Grace
be
with
you
all.
Amen.

Paul,
