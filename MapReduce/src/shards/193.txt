a
prisoner
of
Jesus
Christ,
and
Timothy
our
brother,
unto
Philemon
our
dearly
beloved,
and
fellowlabourer,
001:002
And
to
our
beloved
Apphia,
and
Archippus
our
fellowsoldier,
and
to
the
church
in
thy
house:
001:003
Grace
to
you,
and
peace,
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
001:004
I
thank
my
God,
making
mention
of
thee
always
in
my
prayers,
001:005
Hearing
of
thy
love
and
faith,
which
thou
hast
toward
the
Lord
Jesus,
and
toward
all
saints;
001:006
That
the
communication
of
thy
faith
may
become
effectual
by
the
acknowledging
of
every
good
thing
which
is
in
you
in
Christ
Jesus.
001:007
For
we
have
great
joy
and
consolation
in
thy
love,
because
the
bowels
of
the
saints
are
refreshed
by
thee,
brother.
001:008
Wherefore,
though
I
might
be
much
bold
in
Christ
to
enjoin
thee
that
which
is
convenient,
001:009
Yet
for
love's
sake
I
rather
beseech
thee,
being
such
an
one
as
Paul
the
aged,
and
now
also
a
prisoner
of
Jesus
Christ.
001:010
I
beseech
thee
for
my
son
Onesimus,
whom
I
have
begotten
in
my
bonds:
001:011
Which
in
time
past
was
to
thee
unprofitable,
but
now
profitable
to
thee
and
to
me:
001:012
Whom
I
have
sent
again:
thou
therefore
receive
him,
that
is,
mine
own
bowels:
001:013
Whom
I
would
have
retained
with
me,
that
in
thy
stead
he
might
have
ministered
unto
me
in
the
bonds
of
the
gospel:
001:014
But
without
thy
mind
would
I
do
nothing;
that
thy
benefit
should
not
be
as
it
were
of
necessity,
but
willingly.
001:015
For
perhaps
he
therefore
departed
for
a
season,
that
thou
shouldest
receive
him
for
ever;
001:016
Not
now
as
a
servant,
but
above
a
servant,
a
brother
beloved,
specially
to
me,
but
how
much
more
unto
thee,
both
in
the
flesh,
and
in
the
Lord?
001:017
If
thou
count
me
therefore
a
partner,
receive
him
as
myself.
001:018
If
he
hath
wronged
thee,
or
oweth
thee
ought,
put
that
on
mine
account;
001:019
I
Paul
have
written
it
with
mine
own
hand,
I
will
repay
it:
albeit
I
do
not
say
to
thee
how
thou
owest
unto
me
even
thine
own
self
besides.
001:020
Yea,
brother,
let
me
have
joy
of
thee
in
the
Lord:
refresh
my
bowels
in
the
Lord.
001:021
Having
confidence
in
thy
obedience
I
wrote
unto
thee,
knowing
that
thou
wilt
also
do
more
than
I
say.
001:022
But
withal
prepare
me
also
a
lodging:
for
I
trust
that
through
your
prayers
I
shall
be
given
unto
you.
001:023
There
salute
thee
Epaphras,
my
fellowprisoner
in
Christ
Jesus;
001:024
Marcus,
Aristarchus,
Demas,
Lucas,
my
fellowlabourers.
001:025
The
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
your
spirit.
Amen.
Book
58	Hebrews
001:001
God,
who
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
spake
in
time
past
unto
the
fathers
by
the
prophets,
001:002
Hath
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
his
Son,
whom
he
hath
appointed
heir
of
all
things,
by
whom
also
he
made
the
worlds;
001:003
Who
being
the
brightness
of
his
glory,
and
the
express
image
of
his
person,
and
upholding
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
power,
when
he
had
by
himself
purged
our
sins,
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
Majesty
on
high:
001:004
Being
made
so
much
better
than
the
angels,
as
he
hath
by
inheritance
obtained
a
more
excellent
name
than
they.
001:005
For
unto
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
time,
Thou
art
my
Son,
this
day
have
I
begotten
thee?
And
again,
I
will
be
to
him
a
Father,
and
he
shall
be
to
me
a
Son?
001:006
And
again,
when
he
bringeth
in
the
firstbegotten
into
the
world,
he
saith,
And
let
all
the
angels
of
God
worship
him.
001:007
And
of
the
angels
he
saith,
Who
maketh
his
angels
spirits,
and
his
ministers
a
flame
of
fire.
001:008
But
unto
the
Son
he
saith,
Thy
throne,
O
God,
is
for
ever
and
ever:
a
sceptre
of
righteousness
is
the
sceptre
of
thy
kingdom.
001:009
Thou
hast
loved
righteousness,
and
hated
iniquity;
therefore
God,
even
thy
God,
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
fellows.
001:010
And,
Thou,
Lord,
in
the
beginning
hast
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth;
and
the
heavens
are
the
works
of
thine
hands:
001:011
They
shall
perish;
but
thou
remainest;
and
they
all
shall
wax
old
as
doth
a
garment;
001:012
And
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
fold
them
up,
and
they
shall
be
changed:
but
thou
art
the
same,
and
thy
years
shall
not
fail.
001:013
But
to
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
time,
Sit
on
my
right
hand,
until
I
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool?
001:014
Are
they
not
all
ministering
spirits,
sent
forth
to
minister
for
them
who
shall
be
heirs
of
salvation?
002:001
Therefore
we
ought
to
give
the
more
earnest
heed
to
the
things
which
we
have
heard,
lest
at
any
time
we
should
let
them
slip.
002:002
For
if
the
word
spoken
by
angels
was
stedfast,
and
every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
a
just
recompence
of
reward;
002:003
How
shall
we
escape,
if
we
neglect
so
great
salvation;
which
at
the
first
began
to
be
spoken
by
the
Lord,
and
was
confirmed
unto
us
by
them
that
heard
him;
002:004
God
also
bearing
them
witness,
both
with
signs
and
wonders,
and
with
divers
miracles,
and
gifts
of
the
Holy
Ghost,
according
to
his
own
will?
002:005
For
unto
the
angels
hath
he
not
put
in
subjection
the
world
to
come,
whereof
we
speak.
002:006
But
one
in
a
certain
place
testified,
saying,
What
is
man,
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him?
or
the
son
of
man
that
thou
visitest
him?
002:007
Thou
madest
him
a
little
lower
than
the
angels;
thou
crownedst
him
with
glory
and
honour,
and
didst
set
him
over
the
works
of
thy
hands:
002:008
Thou
hast
put
all
things
in
subjection
under
his
feet.
For
in
that
he
put
all
in
subjection
under
him,
he
left
nothing
that
is
not
put
under
him.
But
now
we
see
not
yet
all
things
put
under
him.
002:009
But
we
see
Jesus,
who
was
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
for
the
suffering
of
death,
crowned
with
glory
and
honour;
that
he
by
the
grace
of
God
should
taste
death
for
every
man.
002:010
For
it
became
him,
for
whom
are
all
things,
and
by
whom
are
all
things,
in
bringing
many
sons
unto
glory,
to
make
the
captain
of
their
salvation
perfect
through
sufferings.
002:011
For
both
he
that
sanctifieth
and
they
who
are
sanctified
are
all
of
one:
for
which
cause
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
them
brethren,
002:012
Saying,
I
will
declare
thy
name
unto
my
brethren,
in
the
midst
of
the
church
will
I
sing
praise
unto
thee.
002:013
And
again,
I
will
put
my
trust
in
him.
And
again,
Behold
I
and
the
children
which
God
hath
given
me.
002:014
Forasmuch
then
as
the
children
are
partakers
of
flesh
and
blood,
he
also
himself
likewise
took
part
of
the
same;
that
through
death
he
might
destroy
him
that
had
the
power
of
death,
that
is,
the
devil;
002:015
And
deliver
them
who
through
fear
of
death
were
all
their
lifetime
subject
to
bondage.
002:016
For
verily
he
took
not
on
him
the
nature
of
angels;
but
he
took
on
him
the
seed
of
Abraham.
002:017
Wherefore
in
all
things
it
behoved
him
to
be
made
like
unto
his
brethren,
that
he
might
be
a
merciful
and
faithful
high
priest
in
things
pertaining
to
God,
to
make
reconciliation
for
the
sins
of
the
people.
002:018
For
in
that
he
himself
hath
suffered
being
tempted,
he
is
able
to
succour
them
that
are
tempted.
003:001
Wherefore,
holy
brethren,
partakers
of
the
heavenly
calling,
consider
the
Apostle
and
High
Priest
of
our
profession,
Christ
Jesus;
003:002
Who
was
faithful
to
him
that
appointed
him,
as
also
Moses
was
faithful
in
all
his
house.
003:003
For
this
man
was
counted
worthy
of
more
glory
than
Moses,
inasmuch
as
he
who
hath
builded
the
house
hath
more
honour
than
the
house.
003:004
For
every
house
is
builded
by
some
man;
but
he
that
built
all
things
is
God.
003:005
And
Moses
verily
was
faithful
in
all
his
house,
as
a
servant,
for
a
testimony
of
those
things
which
were
to
be
spoken
after;
003:006
But
Christ
as
a
son
over
his
own
house;
whose
house
are
we,
if
we
hold
fast
the
confidence
and
the
rejoicing
of
the
hope
firm
unto
the
end.
003:007
Wherefore
(as
the
Holy
Ghost
saith,
To
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice,
003:008
Harden
not
your
hearts,
as
in
the
provocation,
in
the
day
of
temptation
in
the
wilderness:
003:009
When
your
fathers
tempted
me,
proved
me,
and
saw
my
works
forty
years.
003:010
Wherefore
I
was
grieved
with
that
generation,
and
said,
They
do
alway
err
in
their
heart;
and
they
have
not
known
my
ways.
003:011
So
I
sware
in
my
wrath,
They
shall
not
enter
into
my
rest.)
003:012
Take
heed,
brethren,
lest
there
be
in
any
of
you
an
evil
heart
of
unbelief,
in
departing
from
the
living
God.
003:013
But
exhort
one
another
daily,
while
it
is
called
To
day;
lest
any
of
you
be
hardened
through
the
deceitfulness
of
sin.
003:014
For
we
are
made
partakers
of
Christ,
if
we
hold
the
beginning
of
our
confidence
stedfast
unto
the
end;
003:015
While
it
is
said,
To
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice,
harden
not
your
hearts,
as
in
the
provocation.
003:016
For
some,
when
they
had
heard,
did
provoke:
howbeit
not
all
that
came
out
of
Egypt
by
Moses.
003:017
But
with
whom
was
he
grieved
forty
years?
was
it
not
with
them
that
had
sinned,
whose
carcases
fell
in
the
wilderness?
003:018
And
to
whom
sware
he
that
they
should
not
enter
into
his
rest,
but
to
them
that
believed
not?
003:019
So
we
see
that
they
could
not
enter
in
because
of
unbelief.
004:001
Let
us
therefore
fear,
lest,
a
promise
being
left
us
of
entering
into
his
rest,
any
of
you
should
seem
to
come
short
of
it.
004:002
For
unto
us
was
the
gospel
preached,
as
well
as
unto
them:
but
the
word
preached
did
not
profit
them,
not
being
mixed
with
faith
in
them
that
heard
it.
004:003
For
we
which
have
believed
do
enter
into
rest,
as
he
said,
As
I
have
sworn
in
my
wrath,
if
they
shall
enter
into
my
rest:
although
the
works
were
finished
from
the
foundation
of
the
world.
004:004
For
he
spake
in
a
certain
place
of
the
seventh
day
on
this
wise,
And
God
did
rest
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
works.
004:005
And
in
this
place
again,
If
they
shall
enter
into
my
rest.
004:006
Seeing
therefore
it
remaineth
that
some
must
enter
therein,
and
they
to
whom
it
was
first
preached
entered
not
in
because
of
unbelief:
004:007
Again,
he
limiteth
a
certain
day,
saying
in
David,
To
day,
after
so
long
a
time;
as
it
is
said,
To
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice,
harden
not
your
hearts.
004:008
For
if
Jesus
had
given
them
rest,
then
would
he
not
afterward
have
spoken
of
another
day.
004:009
There
remaineth
therefore
a
rest
to
the
people
of
God.
004:010
For
he
that
is
entered
into
his
rest,
he
also
hath
ceased
from
his
own
works,
as
God
did
from
his.
004:011
Let
us
labour
therefore
to
enter
into
that
rest,
lest
any
man
fall
after
the
same
example
of
unbelief.
004:012
For
the
word
of
God
is
quick,
and
powerful,
and
sharper
than
any
twoedged
sword,
piercing
even
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
soul
and
spirit,
and
of
the
joints
and
marrow,
and
is
a
discerner
of
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
heart.
004:013
Neither
is
there
any
creature
that
is
not
manifest
in
his
sight:
but
all
things
are
naked
and
opened
unto
the
eyes
of
him
with
whom
we
have
to
do.
004:014
Seeing
then
that
we
have
a
great
high
priest,
that
is
passed
into
the
heavens,
Jesus
the
Son
of
God,
let
us
hold
fast
our
profession.
004:015
For
we
have
not
an
high
priest
which
cannot
be
touched
with
the
feeling
of
our
infirmities;
but
was
in
all
points
tempted
like
as
we
are,
yet
without
sin.
004:016
Let
us
therefore
come
boldly
unto
the
throne
of
grace,
that
we
may
obtain
mercy,
and
find
grace
to
help
in
time
of
need.
005:001
For
every
high
priest
taken
from
among
men
is
ordained
for
men
in
things
pertaining
to
God,
that
he
may
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
for
sins:
005:002
Who
can
have
compassion
on
the
ignorant,
and
on
them
that
are
out
of
the
way;
for
that
he
himself
also
is
compassed
with
infirmity.
005:003
And
by
reason
hereof
he
ought,
as
for
the
people,
so
also
for
himself,
to
offer
for
sins.
005:004
And
no
man
taketh
this
honour
unto
himself,
but
he
that
is
called
of
God,
as
was
Aaron.
005:005
So
also
Christ
glorified
not
himself
to
be
made
an
high
priest;
but
he
that
said
unto
him,
Thou
art
my
Son,
to
day
have
I
begotten
thee.
005:006
As
he
saith
also
in
another
place,
Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec.
005:007
Who
in
the
days
of
his
flesh,
when
he
had
offered
up
prayers
and
supplications
with
strong
crying
and
tears
unto
him
that
was
able
to
save
him
from
death,
and
was
heard
in
that
he
feared;
005:008
Though
he
were
a
Son,
yet
learned
he
obedience
by
the
things
which
he
suffered;
005:009
And
being
made
perfect,
he
became
the
author
of
eternal
salvation
unto
all
them
that
obey
him;
005:010
Called
of
God
an
high
priest
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec.
005:011
Of
whom
we
have
many
things
to
say,
and
hard
to
be
uttered,
seeing
ye
are
dull
of
hearing.
005:012
For
when
for
the
time
ye
ought
to
be
teachers,
ye
have
need
that
one
teach
you
again
which
be
the
first
principles
of
the
oracles
of
God;
and
are
become
such
as
have
need
of
milk,
and
not
of
strong
meat.
005:013
For
every
one
that
useth
milk
is
unskilful
in
the
word
of
righteousness:
for
he
is
a
babe.
005:014
But
strong
meat
belongeth
to
them
that
are
of
full
age,
even
those
who
by
reason
of
use
have
their
senses
exercised
to
discern
both
good
and
evil.
006:001
Therefore
leaving
the
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
Christ,
let
us
go
on
unto
perfection;
not
laying
again
the
foundation
of
repentance
from
dead
works,
and
of
faith
toward
God,
006:002
Of
the
doctrine
of
baptisms,
and
of
laying
on
of
hands,
and
of
resurrection
of
the
dead,
and
of
eternal
judgment.
006:003
And
this
will
we
do,
if
God
permit.
006:004
For
it
is
impossible
for
those
who
were
once
enlightened,
and
have
tasted
of
the
heavenly
gift,
and
were
made
partakers
of
the
Holy
Ghost,
006:005
And
have
tasted
the
good
word
of
God,
and
the
powers
of
the
world
to
come,
006:006
If
they
shall
fall
away,
to
renew
them
again
unto
repentance;
seeing
they
crucify
to
themselves
the
Son
of
God
afresh,
and
put
him
to
an
open
shame.
006:007
For
the
earth
which
drinketh
in
the
rain
that
cometh
oft
upon
it,
and
bringeth
forth
herbs
meet
for
them
by
whom
it
is
dressed,
receiveth
blessing
from
God:
006:008
But
that
which
beareth
thorns
and
briers
is
rejected,
and
is
nigh
unto
cursing;
whose
end
is
to
be
burned.
006:009
But,
beloved,
we
are
persuaded
better
things
of
you,
and
things
that
accompany
salvation,
though
we
thus
speak.
006:010
For
God
is
not
unrighteous
to
forget
your
work
and
labour
of
love,
which
ye
have
shewed
toward
his
name,
in
that
ye
have
ministered
to
the
saints,
and
do
minister.
006:011
And
we
desire
that
every
one
of
you
do
shew
the
same
diligence
to
the
full
assurance
of
hope
unto
the
end:
006:012
That
ye
be
not
slothful,
but
followers
of
them
who
through
faith
and
patience
inherit
the
promises.
006:013
For
when
God
made
promise
to
Abraham,
because
he
could
swear
by
no
greater,
he
sware
by
himself,
006:014
Saying,
Surely
blessing
I
will
bless
thee,
and
multiplying
I
will
multiply
thee.
006:015
And
so,
after
he
had
patiently
endured,
he
obtained
the
promise.
006:016
For
men
verily
swear
by
the
greater:
and
an
oath
for
confirmation
is
to
them
an
end
of
all
strife.
006:017
Wherein
God,
willing
more
abundantly
to
shew
unto
the
heirs
of
promise
the
immutability
of
his
counsel,
confirmed
it
by
an
oath:
006:018
That
by
two
immutable
things,
in
which
it
was
impossible
for
God
to
lie,
we
might
have
a
strong
consolation,
who
have
fled
for
refuge
to
lay
hold
upon
the
hope
set
before
us:
006:019
Which
hope
we
have
as
an
anchor
of
the
soul,
both
sure
and
stedfast,
and
which
entereth
into
that
within
the
veil;
006:020
Whither
the
forerunner
is
for
us
entered,
even
Jesus,
made
an
high
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec.
007:001
For
this
Melchisedec,
king
of
Salem,
priest
of
the
most
high
God,
who
met
Abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
of
the
kings,
and
blessed
him;
007:002
To
whom
also
Abraham
gave
a
tenth
part
of
all;
first
being
by
interpretation
King
of
righteousness,
and
after
that
also
King
of
Salem,
which
is,
King
of
peace;
007:003
Without
father,
without
mother,
without
descent,
having
neither
beginning
of
days,
nor
end
of
life;
but
made
like
unto
the
Son
of
God;
abideth
a
priest
continually.
007:004
Now
consider
how
great
this
man
was,
unto
whom
even
the
patriarch
Abraham
gave
the
tenth
of
the
spoils.
007:005
And
verily
they
that
are
of
the
sons
of
Levi,
who
receive
the
office
of
the
priesthood,
have
a
commandment
to
take
tithes
of
the
people
according
to
the
law,
that
is,
of
their
brethren,
though
they
come
out
of
the
loins
of
Abraham:
007:006
But
he
whose
descent
is
not
counted
from
them
received
tithes
of
Abraham,
and
blessed
him
that
had
the
promises.
007:007
And
without
all
contradiction
the
less
is
blessed
of
the
better.
007:008
And
here
men
that
die
receive
tithes;
but
there
he
receiveth
them,
of
whom
it
is
witnessed
that
he
liveth.
007:009
And
as
I
may
so
say,
Levi
also,
who
receiveth
tithes,
payed
tithes
in
Abraham.
007:010
For
he
was
yet
in
the
loins
of
his
father,
when
Melchisedec
met
him.
007:011
If
therefore
perfection
were
by
the
Levitical
priesthood,
(for
under
it
the
people
received
the
law,)
what
further
need
was
there
that
another
priest
should
rise
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec,
and
not
be
called
after
the
order
of
Aaron?
007:012
For
the
priesthood
being
changed,
there
is
made
of
necessity
a
change
also
of
the
law.
007:013
For
he
of
whom
these
things
are
spoken
pertaineth
to
another
tribe,
of
which
no
man
gave
attendance
at
the
altar.
007:014
For
it
is
evident
that
our
Lord
sprang
out
of
Juda;
of
which
tribe
Moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priesthood.
007:015
And
it
is
yet
far
more
evident:
for
that
after
the
similitude
of
Melchisedec
there
ariseth
another
priest,
007:016
Who
is
made,
not
after
the
law
of
a
carnal
commandment,
but
after
the
power
of
an
endless
life.
007:017
For
he
testifieth,
Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec.
007:018
For
there
is
verily
a
disannulling
of
the
commandment
going
before
for
the
weakness
and
unprofitableness
thereof.
007:019
For
the
law
made
nothing
perfect,
but
the
bringing
in
of
a
better
hope
did;
by
the
which
we
draw
nigh
unto
God.
007:020
And
inasmuch
as
not
without
an
oath
he
was
made
priest:
007:021
(For
those
priests
were
made
without
an
oath;
but
this
with
an
oath
by
him
that
said
unto
him,
The
Lord
sware
and
will
not
repent,
Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec:)
007:022
By
so
much
was
Jesus
made
a
surety
of
a
better
testament.
007:023
And
they
truly
were
many
priests,
because
they
were
not
suffered
to
continue
by
reason
of
death:
007:024
But
this
man,
because
he
continueth
ever,
hath
an
unchangeable
priesthood.
007:025
Wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
come
unto
God
by
him,
seeing
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercession
for
them.
007:026
For
such
an
high
priest
became
us,
who
is
holy,
harmless,
undefiled,
separate
from
sinners,
and
made
higher
than
the
heavens;
007:027
Who
needeth
not
daily,
as
those
high
priests,
to
offer
up
sacrifice,
first
for
his
own
sins,
and
then
for
the
people's:
for
this
he
did
once,
when
he
offered
up
himself.
007:028
For
the
law
maketh
men
high
priests
which
have
infirmity;
but
the
word
of
the
oath,
which
was
since
the
law,
maketh
the
Son,
who
is
consecrated
for
evermore.
008:001
Now
of
the
things
which
we
have
spoken
this
is
the
sum:
We
have
such
an
high
priest,
who
is
set
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
the
Majesty
in
the
heavens;
008:002
A
minister
of
the
sanctuary,
and
of
the
true
tabernacle,
which
the
Lord
pitched,
and
not
man.
008:003
For
every
high
priest
is
ordained
to
offer
gifts
and
sacrifices:
wherefore
it
is
of
necessity
that
this
man
have
somewhat
also
to
offer.
008:004
For
if
he
were
on
earth,
he
should
not
be
a
priest,
seeing
that
there
are
priests
that
offer
gifts
according
to
the
law:
008:005
Who
serve
unto
the
example
and
shadow
of
heavenly
things,
as
Moses
was
admonished
of
God
when
he
was
about
to
make
the
tabernacle:
for,
See,
saith
he,
that
thou
make
all
things
according
to
the
pattern
shewed
to
thee
in
the
mount.
008:006
But
now
hath
he
obtained
a
more
excellent
ministry,
by
how
much
also
he
is
the
mediator
of
a
better
covenant,
which
was
established
upon
better
promises.
008:007
For
if
that
first
covenant
had
been
faultless,
then
should
no
place
have
been
sought
for
the
second.
008:008
For
finding
fault
with
them,
he
saith,
Behold,
the
days
come,
saith
the
Lord,
when
I
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
Israel
and
with
the
house
of
Judah:
008:009
Not
according
to
the
covenant
that
I
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
when
I
took
them
by
the
hand
to
lead
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt;
because
they
continued
not
in
my
covenant,
and
I
regarded
them
not,
saith
the
Lord.
008:010
For
this
is
the
covenant
that
I
will
make
with
the
house
of
Israel
after
those
days,
saith
the
Lord;
I
will
put
my
laws
into
their
mind,
and
write
them
in
their
hearts:
and
I
will
be
to
them
a
God,
and
they
shall
be
to
me
a
people:
008:011
And
they
shall
not
teach
every
man
his
neighbour,
and
every
man
his
brother,
saying,
Know
the
Lord:
for
all
shall
know
me,
from
the
least
to
the
greatest.
008:012
For
I
will
be
merciful
to
their
unrighteousness,
and
their
sins
and
their
iniquities
will
I
remember
no
more.
008:013
In
that
he
saith,
A
new
covenant,
he
hath
made
the
first
old.
Now
that
which
decayeth
and
waxeth
old
is
ready
to
vanish
away.
009:001
Then
verily
the
first
covenant
had
also
ordinances
of
divine
service,
and
a
worldly
sanctuary.
009:002
For
there
was
a
tabernacle
made;
the
first,
wherein
was
the
candlestick,
and
the
table,
and
the
shewbread;
which
is
called
the
sanctuary.
009:003
And
after
the
second
veil,
the
tabernacle
which
is
called
the
Holiest
of
all;
009:004
Which
had
the
golden
censer,
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
overlaid
round
about
with
gold,
wherein
was
the
golden
pot
that
had
manna,
and
Aaron's
rod
that
budded,
and
the
tables
of
the
covenant;
009:005
And
over
it
the
cherubims
of
glory
shadowing
the
mercyseat;
of
which
we
cannot
now
speak
particularly.
009:006
Now
when
these
things
were
thus
ordained,
the
priests
went
always
into
the
first
tabernacle,
accomplishing
the
service
of
God.
009:007
But
into
the
second
went
the
high
priest
alone
once
every
year,
not
without
blood,
which
he
offered
for
himself,
and
for
the
errors
of
the
people:
009:008
The
Holy
Ghost
this
signifying,
that
the
way
into
the
holiest
of
all
was
not
yet
made
manifest,
while
as
the
first
tabernacle
was
