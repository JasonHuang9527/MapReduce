yet
standing:
009:009
Which
was
a
figure
for
the
time
then
present,
in
which
were
offered
both
gifts
and
sacrifices,
that
could
not
make
him
that
did
the
service
perfect,
as
pertaining
to
the
conscience;
009:010
Which
stood
only
in
meats
and
drinks,
and
divers
washings,
and
carnal
ordinances,
imposed
on
them
until
the
time
of
reformation.
009:011
But
Christ
being
come
an
high
priest
of
good
things
to
come,
by
a
greater
and
more
perfect
tabernacle,
not
made
with
hands,
that
is
to
say,
not
of
this
building;
009:012
Neither
by
the
blood
of
goats
and
calves,
but
by
his
own
blood
he
entered
in
once
into
the
holy
place,
having
obtained
eternal
redemption
for
us.
009:013
For
if
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats,
and
the
ashes
of
an
heifer
sprinkling
the
unclean,
sanctifieth
to
the
purifying
of
the
flesh:
009:014
How
much
more
shall
the
blood
of
Christ,
who
through
the
eternal
Spirit
offered
himself
without
spot
to
God,
purge
your
conscience
from
dead
works
to
serve
the
living
God?
009:015
And
for
this
cause
he
is
the
mediator
of
the
new
testament,
that
by
means
of
death,
for
the
redemption
of
the
transgressions
that
were
under
the
first
testament,
they
which
are
called
might
receive
the
promise
of
eternal
inheritance.
009:016
For
where
a
testament
is,
there
must
also
of
necessity
be
the
death
of
the
testator.
009:017
For
a
testament
is
of
force
after
men
are
dead:
otherwise
it
is
of
no
strength
at
all
while
the
testator
liveth.
009:018
Whereupon
neither
the
first
testament
was
dedicated
without
blood.
009:019
For
when
Moses
had
spoken
every
precept
to
all
the
people
according
to
the
law,
he
took
the
blood
of
calves
and
of
goats,
with
water,
and
scarlet
wool,
and
hyssop,
and
sprinkled
both
the
book,
and
all
the
people,
009:020
Saying,
This
is
the
blood
of
the
testament
which
God
hath
enjoined
unto
you.
009:021
Moreover
he
sprinkled
with
blood
both
the
tabernacle,
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
ministry.
009:022
And
almost
all
things
are
by
the
law
purged
with
blood;
and
without
shedding
of
blood
is
no
remission.
009:023
It
was
therefore
necessary
that
the
patterns
of
things
in
the
heavens
should
be
purified
with
these;
but
the
heavenly
things
themselves
with
better
sacrifices
than
these.
009:024
For
Christ
is
not
entered
into
the
holy
places
made
with
hands,
which
are
the
figures
of
the
true;
but
into
heaven
itself,
now
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
God
for
us:
009:025
Nor
yet
that
he
should
offer
himself
often,
as
the
high
priest
entereth
into
the
holy
place
every
year
with
blood
of
others;
009:026
For
then
must
he
often
have
suffered
since
the
foundation
of
the
world:
but
now
once
in
the
end
of
the
world
hath
he
appeared
to
put
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself.
009:027
And
as
it
is
appointed
unto
men
once
to
die,
but
after
this
the
judgment:
009:028
So
Christ
was
once
offered
to
bear
the
sins
of
many;
and
unto
them
that
look
for
him
shall
he
appear
the
second
time
without
sin
unto
salvation.
010:001
For
the
law
having
a
shadow
of
good
things
to
come,
and
not
the
very
image
of
the
things,
can
never
with
those
sacrifices
which
they
offered
year
by
year
continually
make
the
comers
thereunto
perfect.
010:002
For
then
would
they
not
have
ceased
to
be
offered?
because
that
the
worshippers
once
purged
should
have
had
no
more
conscience
of
sins.
010:003
But
in
those
sacrifices
there
is
a
remembrance
again
made
of
sins
every
year.
010:004
For
it
is
not
possible
that
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
should
take
away
sins.
010:005
Wherefore
when
he
cometh
into
the
world,
he
saith,
Sacrifice
and
offering
thou
wouldest
not,
but
a
body
hast
thou
prepared
me:
010:006
In
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
for
sin
thou
hast
had
no
pleasure.
010:007
Then
said
I,
Lo,
I
come
(in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me,)
to
do
thy
will,
O
God.
010:008
Above
when
he
said,
Sacrifice
and
offering
and
burnt
offerings
and
offering
for
sin
thou
wouldest
not,
neither
hadst
pleasure
therein;
which
are
offered
by
the
law;
010:009
Then
said
he,
Lo,
I
come
to
do
thy
will,
O
God.
He
taketh
away
the
first,
that
he
may
establish
the
second.
010:010
By
the
which
will
we
are
sanctified
through
the
offering
of
the
body
of
Jesus
Christ
once
for
all.
010:011
And
every
priest
standeth
daily
ministering
and
offering
oftentimes
the
same
sacrifices,
which
can
never
take
away
sins:
010:012
But
this
man,
after
he
had
offered
one
sacrifice
for
sins
for
ever,
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
God;
010:013
From
henceforth
expecting
till
his
enemies
be
made
his
footstool.
010:014
For
by
one
offering
he
hath
perfected
for
ever
them
that
are
sanctified.
010:015
Whereof
the
Holy
Ghost
also
is
a
witness
to
us:
for
after
that
he
had
said
before,
010:016
This
is
the
covenant
that
I
will
make
with
them
after
those
days,
saith
the
Lord,
I
will
put
my
laws
into
their
hearts,
and
in
their
minds
will
I
write
them;
010:017
And
their
sins
and
iniquities
will
I
remember
no
more.
010:018
Now
where
remission
of
these
is,
there
is
no
more
offering
for
sin.
010:019
Having
therefore,
brethren,
boldness
to
enter
into
the
holiest
by
the
blood
of
Jesus,
010:020
By
a
new
and
living
way,
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
us,
through
the
veil,
that
is
to
say,
his
flesh;
010:021
And
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
God;
010:022
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience,
and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water.
010:023
Let
us
hold
fast
the
profession
of
our
faith
without
wavering;
(for
he
is
faithful
that
promised;)
010:024
And
let
us
consider
one
another
to
provoke
unto
love
and
to
good
works:
010:025
Not
forsaking
the
assembling
of
ourselves
together,
as
the
manner
of
some
is;
but
exhorting
one
another:
and
so
much
the
more,
as
ye
see
the
day
approaching.
010:026
For
if
we
sin
wilfully
after
that
we
have
received
the
knowledge
of
the
truth,
there
remaineth
no
more
sacrifice
for
sins,
010:027
But
a
certain
fearful
looking
for
of
judgment
and
fiery
indignation,
which
shall
devour
the
adversaries.
010:028
He
that
despised
Moses'
law
died
without
mercy
under
two
or
three
witnesses:
010:029
Of
how
much
sorer
punishment,
suppose
ye,
shall
he
be
thought
worthy,
who
hath
trodden
under
foot
the
Son
of
God,
and
hath
counted
the
blood
of
the
covenant,
wherewith
he
was
sanctified,
an
unholy
thing,
and
hath
done
despite
unto
the
Spirit
of
grace?
010:030
For
we
know
him
that
hath
said,
Vengeance
belongeth
unto
me,
I
will
recompense,
saith
the
Lord.
And
again,
The
Lord
shall
judge
his
people.
010:031
It
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
God.
010:032
But
call
to
remembrance
the
former
days,
in
which,
after
ye
were
illuminated,
ye
endured
a
great
fight
of
afflictions;
010:033
Partly,
whilst
ye
were
made
a
gazingstock
both
by
reproaches
and
afflictions;
and
partly,
whilst
ye
became
companions
of
them
that
were
so
used.
010:034
For
ye
had
compassion
of
me
in
my
bonds,
and
took
joyfully
the
spoiling
of
your
goods,
knowing
in
yourselves
that
ye
have
in
heaven
a
better
and
an
enduring
substance.
010:035
Cast
not
away
therefore
your
confidence,
which
hath
great
recompence
of
reward.
010:036
For
ye
have
need
of
patience,
that,
after
ye
have
done
the
will
of
God,
ye
might
receive
the
promise.
010:037
For
yet
a
little
while,
and
he
that
shall
come
will
come,
and
will
not
tarry.
010:038
Now
the
just
shall
live
by
faith:
but
if
any
man
draw
back,
my
soul
shall
have
no
pleasure
in
him.
010:039
But
we
are
not
of
them
who
draw
back
unto
perdition;
but
of
them
that
believe
to
the
saving
of
the
soul.
011:001
Now
faith
is
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for,
the
evidence
of
things
not
seen.
011:002
For
by
it
the
elders
obtained
a
good
report.
011:003
Through
faith
we
understand
that
the
worlds
were
framed
by
the
word
of
God,
so
that
things
which
are
seen
were
not
made
of
things
which
do
appear.
011:004
By
faith
Abel
offered
unto
God
a
more
excellent
sacrifice
than
Cain,
by
which
he
obtained
witness
that
he
was
righteous,
God
testifying
of
his
gifts:
and
by
it
he
being
dead
yet
speaketh.
011:005
By
faith
Enoch
was
translated
that
he
should
not
see
death;
and
was
not
found,
because
God
had
translated
him:
for
before
his
translation
he
had
this
testimony,
that
he
pleased
God.
011:006
But
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
please
him:
for
he
that
cometh
to
God
must
believe
that
he
is,
and
that
he
is
a
rewarder
of
them
that
diligently
seek
him.
011:007
By
faith
Noah,
being
warned
of
God
of
things
not
seen
as
yet,
moved
with
fear,
prepared
an
ark
to
the
saving
of
his
house;
by
the
which
he
condemned
the
world,
and
became
heir
of
the
righteousness
which
is
by
faith.
011:008
By
faith
Abraham,
when
he
was
called
to
go
out
into
a
place
which
he
should
after
receive
for
an
inheritance,
obeyed;
and
he
went
out,
not
knowing
whither
he
went.
011:009
By
faith
he
sojourned
in
the
land
of
promise,
as
in
a
strange
country,
dwelling
in
tabernacles
with
Isaac
and
Jacob,
the
heirs
with
him
of
the
same
promise:
011:010
For
he
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations,
whose
builder
and
maker
is
God.
011:011
Through
faith
also
Sara
herself
received
strength
to
conceive
seed,
and
was
delivered
of
a
child
when
she
was
past
age,
because
she
judged
him
faithful
who
had
promised.
011:012
Therefore
sprang
there
even
of
one,
and
him
as
good
as
dead,
so
many
as
the
stars
of
the
sky
in
multitude,
and
as
the
sand
which
is
by
the
sea
shore
innumerable.
011:013
These
all
died
in
faith,
not
having
received
the
promises,
but
having
seen
them
afar
off,
and
were
persuaded
of
them,
and
embraced
them,
and
confessed
that
they
were
strangers
and
pilgrims
on
the
earth.
011:014
For
they
that
say
such
things
declare
plainly
that
they
seek
a
country.
011:015
And
truly,
if
they
had
been
mindful
of
that
country
from
whence
they
came
out,
they
might
have
had
opportunity
to
have
returned.
011:016
But
now
they
desire
a
better
country,
that
is,
an
heavenly:
wherefore
God
is
not
ashamed
to
be
called
their
God:
for
he
hath
prepared
for
them
a
city.
011:017
By
faith
Abraham,
when
he
was
tried,
offered
up
Isaac:
and
he
that
had
received
the
promises
offered
up
his
only
begotten
son,
011:018
Of
whom
it
was
said,
That
in
Isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called:
011:019
Accounting
that
God
was
able
to
raise
him
up,
even
from
the
dead;
from
whence
also
he
received
him
in
a
figure.
011:020
By
faith
Isaac
blessed
Jacob
and
Esau
concerning
things
to
come.
011:021
By
faith
Jacob,
when
he
was
a
dying,
blessed
both
the
sons
of
Joseph;
and
worshipped,
leaning
upon
the
top
of
his
staff.
011:022
By
faith
Joseph,
when
he
died,
made
mention
of
the
departing
of
the
children
of
Israel;
and
gave
commandment
concerning
his
bones.
011:023
By
faith
Moses,
when
he
was
born,
was
hid
three
months
of
his
parents,
because
they
saw
he
was
a
proper
child;
and
they
were
not
afraid
of
the
king's
commandment.
011:024
By
faith
Moses,
when
he
was
come
to
years,
refused
to
be
called
the
son
of
Pharaoh's
daughter;
011:025
Choosing
rather
to
suffer
affliction
with
the
people
of
God,
than
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
sin
for
a
season;
011:026
Esteeming
the
reproach
of
Christ
greater
riches
than
the
treasures
in
Egypt:
for
he
had
respect
unto
the
recompence
of
the
reward.
011:027
By
faith
he
forsook
Egypt,
not
fearing
the
wrath
of
the
king:
for
he
endured,
as
seeing
him
who
is
invisible.
011:028
Through
faith
he
kept
the
passover,
and
the
sprinkling
of
blood,
lest
he
that
destroyed
the
firstborn
should
touch
them.
011:029
By
faith
they
passed
through
the
Red
sea
as
by
dry
land:
which
the
Egyptians
assaying
to
do
were
drowned.
011:030
By
faith
the
walls
of
Jericho
fell
down,
after
they
were
compassed
about
seven
days.
011:031
By
faith
the
harlot
Rahab
perished
not
with
them
that
believed
not,
when
she
had
received
the
spies
with
peace.
011:032
And
what
shall
I
more
say?
for
the
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
Gedeon,
and
of
Barak,
and
of
Samson,
and
of
Jephthae;
of
David
also,
and
Samuel,
and
of
the
prophets:
011:033
Who
through
faith
subdued
kingdoms,
wrought
righteousness,
obtained
promises,
stopped
the
mouths
of
lions.
011:034
Quenched
the
violence
of
fire,
escaped
the
edge
of
the
sword,
out
of
weakness
were
made
strong,
waxed
valiant
in
fight,
turned
to
flight
the
armies
of
the
aliens.
011:035
Women
received
their
dead
raised
to
life
again:
and
others
were
tortured,
not
accepting
deliverance;
that
they
might
obtain
a
better
resurrection:
011:036
And
others
had
trial
of
cruel
mockings
and
scourgings,
yea,
moreover
of
bonds
and
imprisonment:
011:037
They
were
stoned,
they
were
sawn
asunder,
were
tempted,
were
slain
with
the
sword:
they
wandered
about
in
sheepskins
and
goatskins;
being
destitute,
afflicted,
tormented;
011:038
(Of
whom
the
world
was
not
worthy:)
they
wandered
in
deserts,
and
in
mountains,
and
in
dens
and
caves
of
the
earth.
011:039
And
these
all,
having
obtained
a
good
report
through
faith,
received
not
the
promise:
011:040
God
having
provided
some
better
thing
for
us,
that
they
without
us
should
not
be
made
perfect.
012:001
Wherefore
seeing
we
also
are
compassed
about
with
so
great
a
cloud
of
witnesses,
let
us
lay
aside
every
weight,
and
the
sin
which
doth
so
easily
beset
us,
and
let
us
run
with
patience
the
race
that
is
set
before
us,
012:002
Looking
unto
Jesus
the
author
and
finisher
of
our
faith;
who
for
the
joy
that
was
set
before
him
endured
the
cross,
despising
the
shame,
and
is
set
down
at
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
God.
012:003
For
consider
him
that
endured
such
contradiction
of
sinners
against
himself,
lest
ye
be
wearied
and
faint
in
your
minds.
012:004
Ye
have
not
yet
resisted
unto
blood,
striving
against
sin.
012:005
And
ye
have
forgotten
the
exhortation
which
speaketh
unto
you
as
unto
children,
My
son,
despise
not
thou
the
chastening
of
the
Lord,
nor
faint
when
thou
art
rebuked
of
him:
012:006
For
whom
the
Lord
loveth
he
chasteneth,
and
scourgeth
every
son
whom
he
receiveth.
012:007
If
ye
endure
chastening,
God
dealeth
with
you
as
with
sons;
for
what
son
is
he
whom
the
father
chasteneth
not?
012:008
But
if
ye
be
without
chastisement,
whereof
all
are
partakers,
then
are
ye
bastards,
and
not
sons.
012:009
Furthermore
we
have
had
fathers
of
our
flesh
which
corrected
us,
and
we
gave
them
reverence:
shall
we
not
much
rather
be
in
subjection
unto
the
Father
of
spirits,
and
live?
012:010
For
they
verily
for
a
few
days
chastened
us
after
their
own
pleasure;
but
he
for
our
profit,
that
we
might
be
partakers
of
his
holiness.
012:011
Now
no
chastening
for
the
present
seemeth
to
be
joyous,
but
grievous:
nevertheless
afterward
it
yieldeth
the
peaceable
fruit
of
righteousness
unto
them
which
are
exercised
thereby.
012:012
Wherefore
lift
up
the
hands
which
hang
down,
and
the
feeble
knees;
012:013
And
make
straight
paths
for
your
feet,
lest
that
which
is
lame
be
turned
out
of
the
way;
but
let
it
rather
be
healed.
012:014
Follow
peace
with
all
men,
and
holiness,
without
which
no
man
shall
see
the
Lord:
012:015
Looking
diligently
lest
any
man
fail
of
the
grace
of
God;
lest
any
root
of
bitterness
springing
up
trouble
you,
and
thereby
many
be
defiled;
012:016
Lest
there
be
any
fornicator,
or
profane
person,
as
Esau,
who
for
one
morsel
of
meat
sold
his
birthright.
012:017
For
ye
know
how
that
afterward,
when
he
would
have
inherited
the
blessing,
he
was
rejected:
for
he
found
no
place
of
repentance,
though
he
sought
it
carefully
with
tears.
012:018
For
ye
are
not
come
unto
the
mount
that
might
be
touched,
and
that
burned
with
fire,
nor
unto
blackness,
and
darkness,
and
tempest,
012:019
And
the
sound
of
a
trumpet,
and
the
voice
of
words;
which
voice
they
that
heard
intreated
that
the
word
should
not
be
spoken
to
them
any
more:
012:020
(For
they
could
not
endure
that
which
was
commanded,
And
if
so
much
as
a
beast
touch
the
mountain,
it
shall
be
stoned,
or
thrust
through
with
a
dart:
012:021
And
so
terrible
was
the
sight,
that
Moses
said,
I
exceedingly
fear
and
quake:)
012:022
But
ye
are
come
unto
mount
Sion,
and
unto
the
city
of
the
living
God,
the
heavenly
Jerusalem,
and
to
an
innumerable
company
of
angels,
012:023
To
the
general
assembly
and
church
of
the
firstborn,
which
are
written
in
heaven,
and
to
God
the
Judge
of
all,
and
to
the
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect,
012:024
And
to
Jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant,
and
to
the
blood
of
sprinkling,
that
speaketh
better
things
that
that
of
Abel.
012:025
See
that
ye
refuse
not
him
that
speaketh.
For
if
they
escaped
not
who
refused
him
that
spake
on
earth,
much
more
shall
not
we
escape,
if
we
turn
away
from
him
that
speaketh
from
heaven:
012:026
Whose
voice
then
shook
the
earth:
but
now
he
hath
promised,
saying,
Yet
once
more
I
shake
not
the
earth
only,
but
also
heaven.
012:027
And
this
word,
Yet
once
more,
signifieth
the
removing
of
those
things
that
are
shaken,
as
of
things
that
are
made,
that
those
things
which
cannot
be
shaken
may
remain.
012:028
Wherefore
we
receiving
a
kingdom
which
cannot
be
moved,
let
us
have
grace,
whereby
we
may
serve
God
acceptably
with
reverence
and
godly
fear:
012:029
For
our
God
is
a
consuming
fire.
013:001
Let
brotherly
love
continue.
013:002
Be
not
forgetful
to
entertain
strangers:
for
thereby
some
have
entertained
angels
unawares.
013:003
Remember
them
that
are
in
bonds,
as
bound
with
them;
and
them
which
suffer
adversity,
as
being
yourselves
also
in
the
body.
013:004
Marriage
is
honourable
in
all,
and
the
bed
undefiled:
but
whoremongers
and
adulterers
God
will
judge.
013:005
Let
your
conversation
be
without
covetousness;
and
be
content
with
such
things
as
ye
have:
for
he
hath
said,
I
will
never
leave
thee,
nor
forsake
thee.
013:006
So
that
we
may
boldly
say,
The
Lord
is
my
helper,
and
I
will
not
fear
what
man
shall
do
unto
me.
013:007
Remember
them
which
have
the
rule
over
you,
who
have
spoken
unto
you
the
word
of
God:
whose
faith
follow,
considering
the
end
of
their
conversation.
013:008
Jesus
Christ
the
same
yesterday,
and
to
day,
and
for
ever.
013:009
Be
not
carried
about
with
divers
and
strange
doctrines.
For
it
is
a
good
thing
that
the
heart
be
established
with
grace;
not
with
meats,
which
have
not
profited
them
that
have
been
occupied
therein.
013:010
We
have
an
altar,
whereof
they
have
no
right
to
eat
which
serve
the
tabernacle.
013:011
For
the
bodies
of
those
beasts,
whose
blood
is
brought
into
the
sanctuary
by
the
high
priest
for
sin,
are
burned
without
the
camp.
013:012
Wherefore
Jesus
also,
that
he
might
sanctify
the
people
with
his
own
blood,
suffered
without
the
gate.
013:013
Let
us
go
forth
therefore
unto
him
without
the
camp,
bearing
his
reproach.
013:014
For
here
have
we
no
continuing
city,
but
we
seek
one
to
come.
013:015
By
him
therefore
let
us
offer
the
sacrifice
of
praise
to
God
continually,
that
is,
the
fruit
of
our
lips
giving
thanks
to
his
name.
013:016
But
to
do
good
and
to
communicate
forget
not:
for
with
such
sacrifices
God
is
well
pleased.
013:017
Obey
them
that
have
the
rule
over
you,
and
submit
yourselves:
for
they
watch
for
your
souls,
as
they
that
must
give
account,
that
they
may
do
it
with
joy,
and
not
with
grief:
for
that
is
unprofitable
for
you.
013:018
Pray
for
us:
for
we
trust
we
have
a
good
conscience,
in
all
things
willing
to
live
honestly.
013:019
But
I
beseech
you
the
rather
to
do
this,
that
I
may
be
restored
to
you
the
sooner.
013:020
Now
the
God
of
peace,
that
brought
again
from
the
dead
our
Lord
Jesus,
that
great
shepherd
of
the
sheep,
through
the
blood
of
the
everlasting
covenant,
013:021
Make
you
perfect
in
every
good
work
to
do
his
will,
working
in
you
that
which
is
wellpleasing
in
his
sight,
through
Jesus
Christ;
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever.
Amen.
013:022
And
I
beseech
you,
brethren,
suffer
the
word
of
exhortation:
for
I
have
written
a
letter
unto
you
in
few
words.
013:023
Know
ye
that
our
brother
Timothy
is
set
at
liberty;
with
whom,
if
he
come
shortly,
I
will
see
you.
013:024
Salute
all
them
that
have
the
rule
over
you,
and
all
the
saints.
They
of
Italy
salute
you.
013:025
Grace
be
with
you
all.
Amen.
Book
59	James
001:001
James,
a
servant
of
God
and
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
to
the
twelve
tribes
which
are
scattered
abroad,
greeting.
001:002
My
brethren,
count
it
all
joy
when
ye
fall
into
divers
temptations;
001:003
Knowing
this,
that
the
trying
of
your
faith
worketh
patience.
001:004
But
let
patience
have
her
perfect
work,
that
ye
may
be
perfect
and
entire,
wanting
nothing.
001:005
If
any
of
you
lack
wisdom,
let
him
ask
of
God,
that
giveth
to
all
men
liberally,
and
upbraideth
not;
and
it
shall
be
given
him.
001:006
But
let
him
ask
in
faith,
nothing
wavering.
For
he
that
wavereth
is
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
driven
with
the
wind
and
tossed.
001:007
For
let
not
that
man
think
that
he
shall
receive
any
thing
of
the
Lord.
001:008
A
double
minded
man
is
unstable
in
all
his
ways.
001:009
Let
the
brother
of
low
degree
rejoice
in
that
he
is
exalted:
001:010
But
the
rich,
in
that
he
is
made
low:
because
as
the
flower
of
the
grass
he
shall
pass
away.
001:011
For
the
sun
is
no
sooner
risen
with
a
burning
heat,
but
it
withereth
the
grass,
and
the
flower
thereof
falleth,
and
the
grace
of
the
fashion
of
it
perisheth:
so
also
shall
the
rich
man
fade
away
in
his
ways.
001:012
Blessed
is
the
man
that
endureth
temptation:
for
when
he
is
tried,
he
shall
receive
the
crown
of
life,
which
the
Lord
hath
promised
to
them
that
love
him.
001:013
Let
no
man
say
when
he
is
tempted,
I
am
tempted
of
God:
for
God
cannot
be
tempted
with
evil,
neither
tempteth
he
any
man:
001:014
But
every
man
is
tempted,
when
he
is
drawn
away
of
his
own
lust,
and
enticed.
001:015
Then
when
lust
hath
conceived,
it
bringeth
forth
sin:
and
sin,
when
it
is
finished,
bringeth
forth
death.
001:016
Do
not
err,
my
beloved
brethren.
001:017
Every
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
is
from
above,
and
cometh
down
from
the
Father
of
lights,
with
whom
is
no
variableness,
neither
shadow
of
turning.
001:018
Of
his
own
will
begat
he
us
with
the
word
of
truth,
that
we
should
be
a
kind
of
firstfruits
of
his
creatures.
001:019
Wherefore,
my
beloved
brethren,
let
every
man
be
swift
to
hear,
slow
to
speak,
slow
to
wrath:
001:020
For
the
wrath
of
man
worketh
not
the
righteousness
of
God.
001:021
Wherefore
lay
apart
all
filthiness
and
superfluity
of
naughtiness,
and
receive
with
meekness
the
engrafted
word,
which
is
able
to
save
your
souls.
001:022
But
be
ye
doers
of
the
word,
and
not
hearers
only,
deceiving
your
own
selves.
001:023
For
if
any
be
a
hearer
of
the
word,
and
not
a
doer,
he
is
like
unto
a
man
beholding
his
natural
face
in
a
glass:
001:024
For
he
beholdeth
himself,
and
goeth
his
way,
and
straightway
forgetteth
what
manner
of
man
he
was.
001:025
But
whoso
looketh
into
the
perfect
law
of
liberty,
and
continueth
therein,
he
being
not
a
forgetful
hearer,
but
a
doer
of
the
work,
this
man
shall
be
blessed
in
his
deed.
001:026
If
any
man
among
you
seem
to
be
religious,
and
bridleth
not
his
tongue,
but
deceiveth
his
