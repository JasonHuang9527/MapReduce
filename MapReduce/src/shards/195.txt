own
heart,
this
man's
religion
is
vain.
001:027
Pure
religion
and
undefiled
before
God
and
the
Father
is
this,
To
visit
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction,
and
to
keep
himself
unspotted
from
the
world.
002:001
My
brethren,
have
not
the
faith
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
the
Lord
of
glory,
with
respect
of
persons.
002:002
For
if
there
come
unto
your
assembly
a
man
with
a
gold
ring,
in
goodly
apparel,
and
there
come
in
also
a
poor
man
in
vile
raiment;
002:003
And
ye
have
respect
to
him
that
weareth
the
gay
clothing,
and
say
unto
him,
Sit
thou
here
in
a
good
place;
and
say
to
the
poor,
Stand
thou
there,
or
sit
here
under
my
footstool:
002:004
Are
ye
not
then
partial
in
yourselves,
and
are
become
judges
of
evil
thoughts?
002:005
Hearken,
my
beloved
brethren,
Hath
not
God
chosen
the
poor
of
this
world
rich
in
faith,
and
heirs
of
the
kingdom
which
he
hath
promised
to
them
that
love
him?
002:006
But
ye
have
despised
the
poor.
Do
not
rich
men
oppress
you,
and
draw
you
before
the
judgment
seats?
002:007
Do
not
they
blaspheme
that
worthy
name
by
the
which
ye
are
called?
002:008
If
ye
fulfil
the
royal
law
according
to
the
scripture,
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself,
ye
do
well:
002:009
But
if
ye
have
respect
to
persons,
ye
commit
sin,
and
are
convinced
of
the
law
as
transgressors.
002:010
For
whosoever
shall
keep
the
whole
law,
and
yet
offend
in
one
point,
he
is
guilty
of
all.
002:011
For
he
that
said,
Do
not
commit
adultery,
said
also,
Do
not
kill.
Now
if
thou
commit
no
adultery,
yet
if
thou
kill,
thou
art
become
a
transgressor
of
the
law.
002:012
So
speak
ye,
and
so
do,
as
they
that
shall
be
judged
by
the
law
of
liberty.
002:013
For
he
shall
have
judgment
without
mercy,
that
hath
shewed
no
mercy;
and
mercy
rejoiceth
against
judgment.
002:014
What
doth
it
profit,
my
brethren,
though
a
man
say
he
hath
faith,
and
have
not
works?
can
faith
save
him?
002:015
If
a
brother
or
sister
be
naked,
and
destitute
of
daily
food,
002:016
And
one
of
you
say
unto
them,
Depart
in
peace,
be
ye
warmed
and
filled;
notwithstanding
ye
give
them
not
those
things
which
are
needful
to
the
body;
what
doth
it
profit?
002:017
Even
so
faith,
if
it
hath
not
works,
is
dead,
being
alone.
002:018
Yea,
a
man
may
say,
Thou
hast
faith,
and
I
have
works:
shew
me
thy
faith
without
thy
works,
and
I
will
shew
thee
my
faith
by
my
works.
002:019
Thou
believest
that
there
is
one
God;
thou
doest
well:
the
devils
also
believe,
and
tremble.
002:020
But
wilt
thou
know,
O
vain
man,
that
faith
without
works
is
dead?
002:021
Was
not
Abraham
our
father
justified
by
works,
when
he
had
offered
Isaac
his
son
upon
the
altar?
002:022
Seest
thou
how
faith
wrought
with
his
works,
and
by
works
was
faith
made
perfect?
002:023
And
the
scripture
was
fulfilled
which
saith,
Abraham
believed
God,
and
it
was
imputed
unto
him
for
righteousness:
and
he
was
called
the
Friend
of
God.
002:024
Ye
see
then
how
that
by
works
a
man
is
justified,
and
not
by
faith
only.
002:025
Likewise
also
was
not
Rahab
the
harlot
justified
by
works,
when
she
had
received
the
messengers,
and
had
sent
them
out
another
way?
002:026
For
as
the
body
without
the
spirit
is
dead,
so
faith
without
works
is
dead
also.
003:001
My
brethren,
be
not
many
masters,
knowing
that
we
shall
receive
the
greater
condemnation.
003:002
For
in
many
things
we
offend
all.
If
any
man
offend
not
in
word,
the
same
is
a
perfect
man,
and
able
also
to
bridle
the
whole
body.
003:003
Behold,
we
put
bits
in
the
horses'
mouths,
that
they
may
obey
us;
and
we
turn
about
their
whole
body.
003:004
Behold
also
the
ships,
which
though
they
be
so
great,
and
are
driven
of
fierce
winds,
yet
are
they
turned
about
with
a
very
small
helm,
whithersoever
the
governor
listeth.
003:005
Even
so
the
tongue
is
a
little
member,
and
boasteth
great
things.
Behold,
how
great
a
matter
a
little
fire
kindleth!
003:006
And
the
tongue
is
a
fire,
a
world
of
iniquity:
so
is
the
tongue
among
our
members,
that
it
defileth
the
whole
body,
and
setteth
on
fire
the
course
of
nature;
and
it
is
set
on
fire
of
hell.
003:007
For
every
kind
of
beasts,
and
of
birds,
and
of
serpents,
and
of
things
in
the
sea,
is
tamed,
and
hath
been
tamed
of
mankind:
003:008
But
the
tongue
can
no
man
tame;
it
is
an
unruly
evil,
full
of
deadly
poison.
003:009
Therewith
bless
we
God,
even
the
Father;
and
therewith
curse
we
men,
which
are
made
after
the
similitude
of
God.
003:010
Out
of
the
same
mouth
proceedeth
blessing
and
cursing.
My
brethren,
these
things
ought
not
so
to
be.
003:011
Doth
a
fountain
send
forth
at
the
same
place
sweet
water
and
bitter?
003:012
Can
the
fig
tree,
my
brethren,
bear
olive
berries?
either
a
vine,
figs?
so
can
no
fountain
both
yield
salt
water
and
fresh.
003:013
Who
is
a
wise
man
and
endued
with
knowledge
among
you?
let
him
shew
out
of
a
good
conversation
his
works
with
meekness
of
wisdom.
003:014
But
if
ye
have
bitter
envying
and
strife
in
your
hearts,
glory
not,
and
lie
not
against
the
truth.
003:015
This
wisdom
descendeth
not
from
above,
but
is
earthly,
sensual,
devilish.
003:016
For
where
envying
and
strife
is,
there
is
confusion
and
every
evil
work.
003:017
But
the
wisdom
that
is
from
above
is
first
pure,
then
peaceable,
gentle,
and
easy
to
be
intreated,
full
of
mercy
and
good
fruits,
without
partiality,
and
without
hypocrisy.
003:018
And
the
fruit
of
righteousness
is
sown
in
peace
of
them
that
make
peace.
004:001
From
whence
come
wars
and
fightings
among
you?
come
they
not
hence,
even
of
your
lusts
that
war
in
your
members?
004:002
Ye
lust,
and
have
not:
ye
kill,
and
desire
to
have,
and
cannot
obtain:
ye
fight
and
war,
yet
ye
have
not,
because
ye
ask
not.
004:003
Ye
ask,
and
receive
not,
because
ye
ask
amiss,
that
ye
may
consume
it
upon
your
lusts.
004:004
Ye
adulterers
and
adulteresses,
know
ye
not
that
the
friendship
of
the
world
is
enmity
with
God?
whosoever
therefore
will
be
a
friend
of
the
world
is
the
enemy
of
God.
004:005
Do
ye
think
that
the
scripture
saith
in
vain,
The
spirit
that
dwelleth
in
us
lusteth
to
envy?
004:006
But
he
giveth
more
grace.
Wherefore
he
saith,
God
resisteth
the
proud,
but
giveth
grace
unto
the
humble.
004:007
Submit
yourselves
therefore
to
God.
Resist
the
devil,
and
he
will
flee
from
you.
004:008
Draw
nigh
to
God,
and
he
will
draw
nigh
to
you.
Cleanse
your
hands,
ye
sinners;
and
purify
your
hearts,
ye
double
minded.
004:009
Be
afflicted,
and
mourn,
and
weep:
let
your
laughter
be
turned
to
mourning,
and
your
joy
to
heaviness.
004:010
Humble
yourselves
in
the
sight
of
the
Lord,
and
he
shall
lift
you
up.
004:011
Speak
not
evil
one
of
another,
brethren.
He
that
speaketh
evil
of
his
brother,
and
judgeth
his
brother,
speaketh
evil
of
the
law,
and
judgeth
the
law:
but
if
thou
judge
the
law,
thou
art
not
a
doer
of
the
law,
but
a
judge.
004:012
There
is
one
lawgiver,
who
is
able
to
save
and
to
destroy:
who
art
thou
that
judgest
another?
004:013
Go
to
now,
ye
that
say,
To
day
or
to
morrow
we
will
go
into
such
a
city,
and
continue
there
a
year,
and
buy
and
sell,
and
get
gain:
004:014
Whereas
ye
know
not
what
shall
be
on
the
morrow.
For
what
is
your
life?
It
is
even
a
vapour,
that
appeareth
for
a
little
time,
and
then
vanisheth
away.
004:015
For
that
ye
ought
to
say,
If
the
Lord
will,
we
shall
live,
and
do
this,
or
that.
004:016
But
now
ye
rejoice
in
your
boastings:
all
such
rejoicing
is
evil.
004:017
Therefore
to
him
that
knoweth
to
do
good,
and
doeth
it
not,
to
him
it
is
sin.
005:001
Go
to
now,
ye
rich
men,
weep
and
howl
for
your
miseries
that
shall
come
upon
you.
005:002
Your
riches
are
corrupted,
and
your
garments
are
motheaten.
005:003
Your
gold
and
silver
is
cankered;
and
the
rust
of
them
shall
be
a
witness
against
you,
and
shall
eat
your
flesh
as
it
were
fire.
Ye
have
heaped
treasure
together
for
the
last
days.
005:004
Behold,
the
hire
of
the
labourers
who
have
reaped
down
your
fields,
which
is
of
you
kept
back
by
fraud,
crieth:
and
the
cries
of
them
which
have
reaped
are
entered
into
the
ears
of
the
Lord
of
sabaoth.
005:005
Ye
have
lived
in
pleasure
on
the
earth,
and
been
wanton;
ye
have
nourished
your
hearts,
as
in
a
day
of
slaughter.
005:006
Ye
have
condemned
and
killed
the
just;
and
he
doth
not
resist
you.
005:007
Be
patient
therefore,
brethren,
unto
the
coming
of
the
Lord.
Behold,
the
husbandman
waiteth
for
the
precious
fruit
of
the
earth,
and
hath
long
patience
for
it,
until
he
receive
the
early
and
latter
rain.
005:008
Be
ye
also
patient;
stablish
your
hearts:
for
the
coming
of
the
Lord
draweth
nigh.
005:009
Grudge
not
one
against
another,
brethren,
lest
ye
be
condemned:
behold,
the
judge
standeth
before
the
door.
005:010
Take,
my
brethren,
the
prophets,
who
have
spoken
in
the
name
of
the
Lord,
for
an
example
of
suffering
affliction,
and
of
patience.
005:011
Behold,
we
count
them
happy
which
endure.
Ye
have
heard
of
the
patience
of
Job,
and
have
seen
the
end
of
the
Lord;
that
the
Lord
is
very
pitiful,
and
of
tender
mercy.
005:012
But
above
all
things,
my
brethren,
swear
not,
neither
by
heaven,
neither
by
the
earth,
neither
by
any
other
oath:
but
let
your
yea
be
yea;
and
your
nay,
nay;
lest
ye
fall
into
condemnation.
005:013
Is
any
among
you
afflicted?
let
him
pray.
Is
any
merry?
let
him
sing
psalms.
005:014
Is
any
sick
among
you?
let
him
call
for
the
elders
of
the
church;
and
let
them
pray
over
him,
anointing
him
with
oil
in
the
name
of
the
Lord:
005:015
And
the
prayer
of
faith
shall
save
the
sick,
and
the
Lord
shall
raise
him
up;
and
if
he
have
committed
sins,
they
shall
be
forgiven
him.
005:016
Confess
your
faults
one
to
another,
and
pray
one
for
another,
that
ye
may
be
healed.
The
effectual
fervent
prayer
of
a
righteous
man
availeth
much.
005:017
Elias
was
a
man
subject
to
like
passions
as
we
are,
and
he
prayed
earnestly
that
it
might
not
rain:
and
it
rained
not
on
the
earth
by
the
space
of
three
years
and
six
months.
005:018
And
he
prayed
again,
and
the
heaven
gave
rain,
and
the
earth
brought
forth
her
fruit.
005:019
Brethren,
if
any
of
you
do
err
from
the
truth,
and
one
convert
him;
005:020
Let
him
know,
that
he
which
converteth
the
sinner
from
the
error
of
his
way
shall
save
a
soul
from
death,
and
shall
hide
a
multitude
of
sins.
Book
60	1
Peter
001:001
Peter,
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ,
to
the
strangers
scattered
throughout
Pontus,
Galatia,
Cappadocia,
Asia,
and
Bithynia,
001:002
Elect
according
to
the
foreknowledge
of
God
the
Father,
through
sanctification
of
the
Spirit,
unto
obedience
and
sprinkling
of
the
blood
of
Jesus
Christ:
Grace
unto
you,
and
peace,
be
multiplied.
001:003
Blessed
be
the
God
and
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
which
according
to
his
abundant
mercy
hath
begotten
us
again
unto
a
lively
hope
by
the
resurrection
of
Jesus
Christ
from
the
dead,
001:004
To
an
inheritance
incorruptible,
and
undefiled,
and
that
fadeth
not
away,
reserved
in
heaven
for
you,
001:005
Who
are
kept
by
the
power
of
God
through
faith
unto
salvation
ready
to
be
revealed
in
the
last
time.
001:006
Wherein
ye
greatly
rejoice,
though
now
for
a
season,
if
need
be,
ye
are
in
heaviness
through
manifold
temptations:
001:007
That
the
trial
of
your
faith,
being
much
more
precious
than
of
gold
that
perisheth,
though
it
be
tried
with
fire,
might
be
found
unto
praise
and
honour
and
glory
at
the
appearing
of
Jesus
Christ:
001:008
Whom
having
not
seen,
ye
love;
in
whom,
though
now
ye
see
him
not,
yet
believing,
ye
rejoice
with
joy
unspeakable
and
full
of
glory:
001:009
Receiving
the
end
of
your
faith,
even
the
salvation
of
your
souls.
001:010
Of
which
salvation
the
prophets
have
enquired
and
searched
diligently,
who
prophesied
of
the
grace
that
should
come
unto
you:
001:011
Searching
what,
or
what
manner
of
time
the
Spirit
of
Christ
which
was
in
them
did
signify,
when
it
testified
beforehand
the
sufferings
of
Christ,
and
the
glory
that
should
follow.
001:012
Unto
whom
it
was
revealed,
that
not
unto
themselves,
but
unto
us
they
did
minister
the
things,
which
are
now
reported
unto
you
by
them
that
have
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
with
the
Holy
Ghost
sent
down
from
heaven;
which
things
the
angels
desire
to
look
into.
001:013
Wherefore
gird
up
the
loins
of
your
mind,
be
sober,
and
hope
to
the
end
for
the
grace
that
is
to
be
brought
unto
you
at
the
revelation
of
Jesus
Christ;
001:014
As
obedient
children,
not
fashioning
yourselves
according
to
the
former
lusts
in
your
ignorance:
001:015
But
as
he
which
hath
called
you
is
holy,
so
be
ye
holy
in
all
manner
of
conversation;
001:016
Because
it
is
written,
Be
ye
holy;
for
I
am
holy.
001:017
And
if
ye
call
on
the
Father,
who
without
respect
of
persons
judgeth
according
to
every
man's
work,
pass
the
time
of
your
sojourning
here
in
fear:
001:018
Forasmuch
as
ye
know
that
ye
were
not
redeemed
with
corruptible
things,
as
silver
and
gold,
from
your
vain
conversation
received
by
tradition
from
your
fathers;
001:019
But
with
the
precious
blood
of
Christ,
as
of
a
lamb
without
blemish
and
without
spot:
001:020
Who
verily
was
foreordained
before
the
foundation
of
the
world,
but
was
manifest
in
these
last
times
for
you,
001:021
Who
by
him
do
believe
in
God,
that
raised
him
up
from
the
dead,
and
gave
him
glory;
that
your
faith
and
hope
might
be
in
God.
001:022
Seeing
ye
have
purified
your
souls
in
obeying
the
truth
through
the
Spirit
unto
unfeigned
love
of
the
brethren,
see
that
ye
love
one
another
with
a
pure
heart
fervently:
001:023
Being
born
again,
not
of
corruptible
seed,
but
of
incorruptible,
by
the
word
of
God,
which
liveth
and
abideth
for
ever.
001:024
For
all
flesh
is
as
grass,
and
all
the
glory
of
man
as
the
flower
of
grass.
The
grass
withereth,
and
the
flower
thereof
falleth
away:
001:025
But
the
word
of
the
Lord
endureth
for
ever.
And
this
is
the
word
which
by
the
gospel
is
preached
unto
you.
002:001
Wherefore
laying
aside
all
malice,
and
all
guile,
and
hypocrisies,
and
envies,
all
evil
speakings,
002:002
As
newborn
babes,
desire
the
sincere
milk
of
the
word,
that
ye
may
grow
thereby:
002:003
If
so
be
ye
have
tasted
that
the
Lord
is
gracious.
002:004
To
whom
coming,
as
unto
a
living
stone,
disallowed
indeed
of
men,
but
chosen
of
God,
and
precious,
002:005
Ye
also,
as
lively
stones,
are
built
up
a
spiritual
house,
an
holy
priesthood,
to
offer
up
spiritual
sacrifices,
acceptable
to
God
by
Jesus
Christ.
002:006
Wherefore
also
it
is
contained
in
the
scripture,
Behold,
I
lay
in
Sion
a
chief
corner
stone,
elect,
precious:
and
he
that
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
confounded.
002:007
Unto
you
therefore
which
believe
he
is
precious:
but
unto
them
which
be
disobedient,
the
stone
which
the
builders
disallowed,
the
same
is
made
the
head
of
the
corner,
002:008
And
a
stone
of
stumbling,
and
a
rock
of
offence,
even
to
them
which
stumble
at
the
word,
being
disobedient:
whereunto
also
they
were
appointed.
002:009
But
ye
are
a
chosen
generation,
a
royal
priesthood,
an
holy
nation,
a
peculiar
people;
that
ye
should
shew
forth
the
praises
of
him
who
hath
called
you
out
of
darkness
into
his
marvellous
light;
002:010
Which
in
time
past
were
not
a
people,
but
are
now
the
people
of
God:
which
had
not
obtained
mercy,
but
now
have
obtained
mercy.
002:011
Dearly
beloved,
I
beseech
you
as
strangers
and
pilgrims,
abstain
from
fleshly
lusts,
which
war
against
the
soul;
002:012
Having
your
conversation
honest
among
the
Gentiles:
that,
whereas
they
speak
against
you
as
evildoers,
they
may
by
your
good
works,
which
they
shall
behold,
glorify
God
in
the
day
of
visitation.
002:013
Submit
yourselves
to
every
ordinance
of
man
for
the
Lord's
sake:
whether
it
be
to
the
king,
as
supreme;
002:014
Or
unto
governors,
as
unto
them
that
are
sent
by
him
for
the
punishment
of
evildoers,
and
for
the
praise
of
them
that
do
well.
002:015
For
so
is
the
will
of
God,
that
with
well
doing
ye
may
put
to
silence
the
ignorance
of
foolish
men:
002:016
As
free,
and
not
using
your
liberty
for
a
cloke
of
maliciousness,
but
as
the
servants
of
God.
002:017
Honour
all
men.
Love
the
brotherhood.
Fear
God.
Honour
the
king.
002:018
Servants,
be
subject
to
your
masters
with
all
fear;
not
only
to
the
good
and
gentle,
but
also
to
the
froward.
002:019
For
this
is
thankworthy,
if
a
man
for
conscience
toward
God
endure
grief,
suffering
wrongfully.
002:020
For
what
glory
is
it,
if,
when
ye
be
buffeted
for
your
faults,
ye
shall
take
it
patiently?
but
if,
when
ye
do
well,
and
suffer
for
it,
ye
take
it
patiently,
this
is
acceptable
with
God.
002:021
For
even
hereunto
were
ye
called:
because
Christ
also
suffered
for
us,
leaving
us
an
example,
that
ye
should
follow
his
steps:
002:022
Who
did
no
sin,
neither
was
guile
found
in
his
mouth:
002:023
Who,
when
he
was
reviled,
reviled
not
again;
when
he
suffered,
he
threatened
not;
but
committed
himself
to
him
that
judgeth
righteously:
002:024
Who
his
own
self
bare
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
tree,
that
we,
being
dead
to
sins,
should
live
unto
righteousness:
by
whose
stripes
ye
were
healed.
002:025
For
ye
were
as
sheep
going
astray;
but
are
now
returned
unto
the
Shepherd
and
Bishop
of
your
souls.
003:001
Likewise,
ye
wives,
be
in
subjection
to
your
own
husbands;
that,
if
any
obey
not
the
word,
they
also
may
without
the
word
be
won
by
the
conversation
of
the
wives;
003:002
While
they
behold
your
chaste
conversation
coupled
with
fear.
003:003
Whose
adorning
let
it
not
be
that
outward
adorning
of
plaiting
the
hair,
and
of
wearing
of
gold,
or
of
putting
on
of
apparel;
003:004
But
let
it
be
the
hidden
man
of
the
heart,
in
that
which
is
not
corruptible,
even
the
ornament
of
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit,
which
is
in
the
sight
of
God
of
great
price.
003:005
For
after
this
manner
in
the
old
time
the
holy
women
also,
who
trusted
in
God,
adorned
themselves,
being
in
subjection
unto
their
own
husbands:
003:006
Even
as
Sara
obeyed
Abraham,
calling
him
lord:
whose
daughters
ye
are,
as
long
as
ye
do
well,
and
are
not
afraid
with
any
amazement.
003:007
Likewise,
ye
husbands,
dwell
with
them
according
to
knowledge,
giving
honour
unto
the
wife,
as
unto
the
weaker
vessel,
and
as
being
heirs
together
of
the
grace
of
life;
that
your
prayers
be
not
hindered.
003:008
Finally,
be
ye
all
of
one
mind,
having
compassion
one
of
another,
love
as
brethren,
be
pitiful,
be
courteous:
003:009
Not
rendering
evil
for
evil,
or
railing
for
railing:
but
contrariwise
blessing;
knowing
that
ye
are
thereunto
called,
that
ye
should
inherit
a
blessing.
003:010
For
he
that
will
love
life,
and
see
good
days,
let
him
refrain
his
tongue
from
evil,
and
his
lips
that
they
speak
no
guile:
003:011
Let
him
eschew
evil,
and
do
good;
let
him
seek
peace,
and
ensue
it.
003:012
For
the
eyes
of
the
Lord
are
over
the
righteous,
and
his
ears
are
open
unto
their
prayers:
but
the
face
of
the
Lord
is
against
them
that
do
evil.
003:013
And
who
is
he
that
will
harm
you,
if
ye
be
followers
of
that
which
is
good?
003:014
But
and
if
ye
suffer
for
righteousness'
sake,
happy
are
ye:
and
be
not
afraid
of
their
terror,
neither
be
troubled;
003:015
But
sanctify
the
Lord
God
in
your
hearts:
and
be
ready
always
to
give
an
answer
to
every
man
that
asketh
you
a
reason
of
the
hope
that
is
in
you
with
meekness
and
fear:
003:016
Having
a
good
conscience;
that,
whereas
they
speak
evil
of
you,
as
of
evildoers,
they
may
be
ashamed
that
falsely
accuse
your
good
conversation
in
Christ.
003:017
For
it
is
better,
if
the
will
of
God
be
so,
that
ye
suffer
for
well
doing,
than
for
evil
doing.
003:018
For
Christ
also
hath
once
suffered
for
sins,
the
just
for
the
unjust,
that
he
might
bring
us
to
God,
being
put
to
death
in
the
flesh,
but
quickened
by
the
Spirit:
003:019
By
which
also
he
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
in
prison;
003:020
Which
sometime
were
disobedient,
when
once
the
longsuffering
of
God
waited
in
the
days
of
Noah,
while
the
ark
was
a
preparing,
wherein
few,
that
is,
eight
souls
were
saved
by
water.
003:021
The
like
figure
whereunto
even
baptism
doth
also
now
save
us
(not
the
putting
away
of
the
filth
of
the
flesh,
but
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
toward
God,)
by
the
resurrection
of
Jesus
Christ:
003:022
Who
is
gone
into
heaven,
and
is
on
the
right
hand
of
God;
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
being
made
subject
unto
him.
004:001
Forasmuch
then
as
Christ
hath
suffered
for
us
in
the
flesh,
arm
yourselves
likewise
with
the
same
mind:
for
he
that
hath
suffered
in
the
flesh
hath
ceased
from
sin;
004:002
That
he
no
longer
should
live
the
rest
of
his
time
in
the
flesh
to
the
lusts
of
men,
but
to
the
will
of
God.
004:003
For
the
time
past
of
our
life
may
suffice
us
to
have
wrought
the
will
of
the
Gentiles,
when
we
walked
in
lasciviousness,
lusts,
excess
of
wine,
revellings,
banquetings,
and
abominable
idolatries:
004:004
Wherein
they
think
it
strange
that
ye
run
not
with
them
to
the
same
excess
of
riot,
speaking
evil
of
you:
004:005
Who
shall
give
account
to
him
that
is
ready
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead.
004:006
For
for
this
cause
was
the
gospel
preached
also
to
them
that
are
dead,
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh,
but
live
according
to
God
in
the
spirit.
004:007
But
the
end
of
all
things
is
at
hand:
be
ye
therefore
sober,
and
watch
unto
prayer.
004:008
And
above
all
things
have
fervent
charity
among
yourselves:
for
charity
shall
cover
the
multitude
of
sins.
004:009
Use
hospitality
one
to
another
without
grudging.
004:010
As
every
man
hath
received
the
gift,
even
so
minister
the
same
one
to
another,
as
good
stewards
of
the
manifold
grace
of
God.
004:011
If
any
man
speak,
let
him
speak
as
the
oracles
of
God;
if
any
man
minister,
let
him
do
it
as
of
the
ability
which
God
giveth:
that
God
in
all
things
may
be
glorified
through
Jesus
Christ,
to
whom
be
praise
and
dominion
for
ever
and
ever.
Amen.
004:012
Beloved,
think
it
not
strange
concerning
the
fiery
trial
which
is
to
try
you,
as
though
some
strange
thing
happened
unto
you:
004:013
But
rejoice,
inasmuch
as
ye
are
partakers
of
Christ's
sufferings;
that,
when
his
glory
shall
be
revealed,
ye
may
be
glad
also
with
exceeding
joy.
004:014
If
ye
be
reproached
for
the
name
of
Christ,
happy
are
ye;
for
the
spirit
of
glory
and
of
God
resteth
upon
you:
on
their
part
he
is
evil
spoken
of,
but
on
your
part
he
is
glorified.
004:015
But
let
none
of
you
suffer
as
a
murderer,
or
as
a
thief,
or
as
an
evildoer,
or
as
a
busybody
in
other
men's
matters.
004:016
Yet
if
any
man
suffer
as
a
Christian,
let
him
not
be
ashamed;
but
let
him
glorify
God
on
this
behalf.
004:017
For
the
time
is
come
that
judgment
must
begin
at
the
house
of
God:
and
if
it
first
begin
at
us,
what
shall
the
end
be
of
them
that
