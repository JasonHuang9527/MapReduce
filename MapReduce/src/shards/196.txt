obey
not
the
gospel
of
God?
004:018
And
if
the
righteous
scarcely
be
saved,
where
shall
the
ungodly
and
the
sinner
appear?
004:019
Wherefore
let
them
that
suffer
according
to
the
will
of
God
commit
the
keeping
of
their
souls
to
him
in
well
doing,
as
unto
a
faithful
Creator.
005:001
The
elders
which
are
among
you
I
exhort,
who
am
also
an
elder,
and
a
witness
of
the
sufferings
of
Christ,
and
also
a
partaker
of
the
glory
that
shall
be
revealed:
005:002
Feed
the
flock
of
God
which
is
among
you,
taking
the
oversight
thereof,
not
by
constraint,
but
willingly;
not
for
filthy
lucre,
but
of
a
ready
mind;
005:003
Neither
as
being
lords
over
God's
heritage,
but
being
ensamples
to
the
flock.
005:004
And
when
the
chief
Shepherd
shall
appear,
ye
shall
receive
a
crown
of
glory
that
fadeth
not
away.
005:005
Likewise,
ye
younger,
submit
yourselves
unto
the
elder.
Yea,
all
of
you
be
subject
one
to
another,
and
be
clothed
with
humility:
for
God
resisteth
the
proud,
and
giveth
grace
to
the
humble.
005:006
Humble
yourselves
therefore
under
the
mighty
hand
of
God,
that
he
may
exalt
you
in
due
time:
005:007
Casting
all
your
care
upon
him;
for
he
careth
for
you.
005:008
Be
sober,
be
vigilant;
because
your
adversary
the
devil,
as
a
roaring
lion,
walketh
about,
seeking
whom
he
may
devour:
005:009
Whom
resist
stedfast
in
the
faith,
knowing
that
the
same
afflictions
are
accomplished
in
your
brethren
that
are
in
the
world.
005:010
But
the
God
of
all
grace,
who
hath
called
us
unto
his
eternal
glory
by
Christ
Jesus,
after
that
ye
have
suffered
a
while,
make
you
perfect,
stablish,
strengthen,
settle
you.
005:011
To
him
be
glory
and
dominion
for
ever
and
ever.
Amen.
005:012
By
Silvanus,
a
faithful
brother
unto
you,
as
I
suppose,
I
have
written
briefly,
exhorting,
and
testifying
that
this
is
the
true
grace
of
God
wherein
ye
stand.
005:013
The
church
that
is
at
Babylon,
elected
together
with
you,
saluteth
you;
and
so
doth
Marcus
my
son.
005:014
Greet
ye
one
another
with
a
kiss
of
charity.
Peace
be
with
you
all
that
are
in
Christ
Jesus.
Amen.
Book
61	2
Peter
001:001
Simon
Peter,
a
servant
and
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ,
to
them
that
have
obtained
like
precious
faith
with
us
through
the
righteousness
of
God
and
our
Saviour
Jesus
Christ:
001:002
Grace
and
peace
be
multiplied
unto
you
through
the
knowledge
of
God,
and
of
Jesus
our
Lord,
001:003
According
as
his
divine
power
hath
given
unto
us
all
things
that
pertain
unto
life
and
godliness,
through
the
knowledge
of
him
that
hath
called
us
to
glory
and
virtue:
001:004
Whereby
are
given
unto
us
exceeding
great
and
precious
promises:
that
by
these
ye
might
be
partakers
of
the
divine
nature,
having
escaped
the
corruption
that
is
in
the
world
through
lust.
001:005
And
beside
this,
giving
all
diligence,
add
to
your
faith
virtue;
and
to
virtue
knowledge;
001:006
And
to
knowledge
temperance;
and
to
temperance
patience;
and
to
patience
godliness;
001:007
And
to
godliness
brotherly
kindness;
and
to
brotherly
kindness
charity.
001:008
For
if
these
things
be
in
you,
and
abound,
they
make
you
that
ye
shall
neither
be
barren
nor
unfruitful
in
the
knowledge
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
001:009
But
he
that
lacketh
these
things
is
blind,
and
cannot
see
afar
off,
and
hath
forgotten
that
he
was
purged
from
his
old
sins.
001:010
Wherefore
the
rather,
brethren,
give
diligence
to
make
your
calling
and
election
sure:
for
if
ye
do
these
things,
ye
shall
never
fall:
001:011
For
so
an
entrance
shall
be
ministered
unto
you
abundantly
into
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ.
001:012
Wherefore
I
will
not
be
negligent
to
put
you
always
in
remembrance
of
these
things,
though
ye
know
them,
and
be
established
in
the
present
truth.
001:013
Yea,
I
think
it
meet,
as
long
as
I
am
in
this
tabernacle,
to
stir
you
up
by
putting
you
in
remembrance;
001:014
Knowing
that
shortly
I
must
put
off
this
my
tabernacle,
even
as
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
hath
shewed
me.
001:015
Moreover
I
will
endeavour
that
ye
may
be
able
after
my
decease
to
have
these
things
always
in
remembrance.
001:016
For
we
have
not
followed
cunningly
devised
fables,
when
we
made
known
unto
you
the
power
and
coming
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
but
were
eyewitnesses
of
his
majesty.
001:017
For
he
received
from
God
the
Father
honour
and
glory,
when
there
came
such
a
voice
to
him
from
the
excellent
glory,
This
is
my
beloved
Son,
in
whom
I
am
well
pleased.
001:018
And
this
voice
which
came
from
heaven
we
heard,
when
we
were
with
him
in
the
holy
mount.
001:019
We
have
also
a
more
sure
word
of
prophecy;
whereunto
ye
do
well
that
ye
take
heed,
as
unto
a
light
that
shineth
in
a
dark
place,
until
the
day
dawn,
and
the
day
star
arise
in
your
hearts:
001:020
Knowing
this
first,
that
no
prophecy
of
the
scripture
is
of
any
private
interpretation.
001:021
For
the
prophecy
came
not
in
old
time
by
the
will
of
man:
but
holy
men
of
God
spake
as
they
were
moved
by
the
Holy
Ghost.
002:001
But
there
were
false
prophets
also
among
the
people,
even
as
there
shall
be
false
teachers
among
you,
who
privily
shall
bring
in
damnable
heresies,
even
denying
the
Lord
that
bought
them,
and
bring
upon
themselves
swift
destruction.
002:002
And
many
shall
follow
their
pernicious
ways;
by
reason
of
whom
the
way
of
truth
shall
be
evil
spoken
of.
002:003
And
through
covetousness
shall
they
with
feigned
words
make
merchandise
of
you:
whose
judgment
now
of
a
long
time
lingereth
not,
and
their
damnation
slumbereth
not.
002:004
For
if
God
spared
not
the
angels
that
sinned,
but
cast
them
down
to
hell,
and
delivered
them
into
chains
of
darkness,
to
be
reserved
unto
judgment;
002:005
And
spared
not
the
old
world,
but
saved
Noah
the
eighth
person,
a
preacher
of
righteousness,
bringing
in
the
flood
upon
the
world
of
the
ungodly;
002:006
And
turning
the
cities
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrha
into
ashes
condemned
them
with
an
overthrow,
making
them
an
ensample
unto
those
that
after
should
live
ungodly;
002:007
And
delivered
just
Lot,
vexed
with
the
filthy
conversation
of
the
wicked:
002:008
(For
that
righteous
man
dwelling
among
them,
in
seeing
and
hearing,
vexed
his
righteous
soul
from
day
to
day
with
their
unlawful
deeds;)
002:009
The
Lord
knoweth
how
to
deliver
the
godly
out
of
temptations,
and
to
reserve
the
unjust
unto
the
day
of
judgment
to
be
punished:
002:010
But
chiefly
them
that
walk
after
the
flesh
in
the
lust
of
uncleanness,
and
despise
government.
Presumptuous
are
they,
selfwilled,
they
are
not
afraid
to
speak
evil
of
dignities.
002:011
Whereas
angels,
which
are
greater
in
power
and
might,
bring
not
railing
accusation
against
them
before
the
Lord.
002:012
But
these,
as
natural
brute
beasts,
made
to
be
taken
and
destroyed,
speak
evil
of
the
things
that
they
understand
not;
and
shall
utterly
perish
in
their
own
corruption;
002:013
And
shall
receive
the
reward
of
unrighteousness,
as
they
that
count
it
pleasure
to
riot
in
the
day
time.
Spots
they
are
and
blemishes,
sporting
themselves
with
their
own
deceivings
while
they
feast
with
you;
002:014
Having
eyes
full
of
adultery,
and
that
cannot
cease
from
sin;
beguiling
unstable
souls:
an
heart
they
have
exercised
with
covetous
practices;
cursed
children:
002:015
Which
have
forsaken
the
right
way,
and
are
gone
astray,
following
the
way
of
Balaam
the
son
of
Bosor,
who
loved
the
wages
of
unrighteousness;
002:016
But
was
rebuked
for
his
iniquity:
the
dumb
ass
speaking
with
man's
voice
forbad
the
madness
of
the
prophet.
002:017
These
are
wells
without
water,
clouds
that
are
carried
with
a
tempest;
to
whom
the
mist
of
darkness
is
reserved
for
ever.
002:018
For
when
they
speak
great
swelling
words
of
vanity,
they
allure
through
the
lusts
of
the
flesh,
through
much
wantonness,
those
that
were
clean
escaped
from
them
who
live
in
error.
002:019
While
they
promise
them
liberty,
they
themselves
are
the
servants
of
corruption:
for
of
whom
a
man
is
overcome,
of
the
same
is
he
brought
in
bondage.
002:020
For
if
after
they
have
escaped
the
pollutions
of
the
world
through
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ,
they
are
again
entangled
therein,
and
overcome,
the
latter
end
is
worse
with
them
than
the
beginning.
002:021
For
it
had
been
better
for
them
not
to
have
known
the
way
of
righteousness,
than,
after
they
have
known
it,
to
turn
from
the
holy
commandment
delivered
unto
them.
002:022
But
it
is
happened
unto
them
according
to
the
true
proverb,
The
dog
is
turned
to
his
own
vomit
again;
and
the
sow
that
was
washed
to
her
wallowing
in
the
mire.
003:001
This
second
epistle,
beloved,
I
now
write
unto
you;
in
both
which
I
stir
up
your
pure
minds
by
way
of
remembrance:
003:002
That
ye
may
be
mindful
of
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
by
the
holy
prophets,
and
of
the
commandment
of
us
the
apostles
of
the
Lord
and
Saviour:
003:003
Knowing
this
first,
that
there
shall
come
in
the
last
days
scoffers,
walking
after
their
own
lusts,
003:004
And
saying,
Where
is
the
promise
of
his
coming?
for
since
the
fathers
fell
asleep,
all
things
continue
as
they
were
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation.
003:005
For
this
they
willingly
are
ignorant
of,
that
by
the
word
of
God
the
heavens
were
of
old,
and
the
earth
standing
out
of
the
water
and
in
the
water:
003:006
Whereby
the
world
that
then
was,
being
overflowed
with
water,
perished:
003:007
But
the
heavens
and
the
earth,
which
are
now,
by
the
same
word
are
kept
in
store,
reserved
unto
fire
against
the
day
of
judgment
and
perdition
of
ungodly
men.
003:008
But,
beloved,
be
not
ignorant
of
this
one
thing,
that
one
day
is
with
the
Lord
as
a
thousand
years,
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day.
003:009
The
Lord
is
not
slack
concerning
his
promise,
as
some
men
count
slackness;
but
is
longsuffering
to
us-ward,
not
willing
that
any
should
perish,
but
that
all
should
come
to
repentance.
003:010
But
the
day
of
the
Lord
will
come
as
a
thief
in
the
night;
in
the
which
the
heavens
shall
pass
away
with
a
great
noise,
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat,
the
earth
also
and
the
works
that
are
therein
shall
be
burned
up.
003:011
Seeing
then
that
all
these
things
shall
be
dissolved,
what
manner
of
persons
ought
ye
to
be
in
all
holy
conversation
and
godliness,
003:012
Looking
for
and
hasting
unto
the
coming
of
the
day
of
God,
wherein
the
heavens
being
on
fire
shall
be
dissolved,
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat?
003:013
Nevertheless
we,
according
to
his
promise,
look
for
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth,
wherein
dwelleth
righteousness.
003:014
Wherefore,
beloved,
seeing
that
ye
look
for
such
things,
be
diligent
that
ye
may
be
found
of
him
in
peace,
without
spot,
and
blameless.
003:015
And
account
that
the
longsuffering
of
our
Lord
is
salvation;
even
as
our
beloved
brother
Paul
also
according
to
the
wisdom
given
unto
him
hath
written
unto
you;
003:016
As
also
in
all
his
epistles,
speaking
in
them
of
these
things;
in
which
are
some
things
hard
to
be
understood,
which
they
that
are
unlearned
and
unstable
wrest,
as
they
do
also
the
other
scriptures,
unto
their
own
destruction.
003:017
Ye
therefore,
beloved,
seeing
ye
know
these
things
before,
beware
lest
ye
also,
being
led
away
with
the
error
of
the
wicked,
fall
from
your
own
stedfastness.
003:018
But
grow
in
grace,
and
in
the
knowledge
of
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ.
To
him
be
glory
both
now
and
for
ever.
Amen.
Book
62	1
John
001:001
That
which
was
from
the
beginning,
which
we
have
heard,
which
we
have
seen
with
our
eyes,
which
we
have
looked
upon,
and
our
hands
have
handled,
of
the
Word
of
life;
001:002
(For
the
life
was
manifested,
and
we
have
seen
it,
and
bear
witness,
and
shew
unto
you
that
eternal
life,
which
was
with
the
Father,
and
was
manifested
unto
us;)
001:003
That
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
declare
we
unto
you,
that
ye
also
may
have
fellowship
with
us:
and
truly
our
fellowship
is
with
the
Father,
and
with
his
Son
Jesus
Christ.
001:004
And
these
things
write
we
unto
you,
that
your
joy
may
be
full.
001:005
This
then
is
the
message
which
we
have
heard
of
him,
and
declare
unto
you,
that
God
is
light,
and
in
him
is
no
darkness
at
all.
001:006
If
we
say
that
we
have
fellowship
with
him,
and
walk
in
darkness,
we
lie,
and
do
not
the
truth:
001:007
But
if
we
walk
in
the
light,
as
he
is
in
the
light,
we
have
fellowship
one
with
another,
and
the
blood
of
Jesus
Christ
his
Son
cleanseth
us
from
all
sin.
001:008
If
we
say
that
we
have
no
sin,
we
deceive
ourselves,
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us.
001:009
If
we
confess
our
sins,
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins,
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness.
001:010
If
we
say
that
we
have
not
sinned,
we
make
him
a
liar,
and
his
word
is
not
in
us.
002:001
My
little
children,
these
things
write
I
unto
you,
that
ye
sin
not.
And
if
any
man
sin,
we
have
an
advocate
with
the
Father,
Jesus
Christ
the
righteous:
002:002
And
he
is
the
propitiation
for
our
sins:
and
not
for
our's
only,
but
also
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world.
002:003
And
hereby
we
do
know
that
we
know
him,
if
we
keep
his
commandments.
002:004
He
that
saith,
I
know
him,
and
keepeth
not
his
commandments,
is
a
liar,
and
the
truth
is
not
in
him.
002:005
But
whoso
keepeth
his
word,
in
him
verily
is
the
love
of
God
perfected:
hereby
know
we
that
we
are
in
him.
002:006
He
that
saith
he
abideth
in
him
ought
himself
also
so
to
walk,
even
as
he
walked.
002:007
Brethren,
I
write
no
new
commandment
unto
you,
but
an
old
commandment
which
ye
had
from
the
beginning.
The
old
commandment
is
the
word
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning.
002:008
Again,
a
new
commandment
I
write
unto
you,
which
thing
is
true
in
him
and
in
you:
because
the
darkness
is
past,
and
the
true
light
now
shineth.
002:009
He
that
saith
he
is
in
the
light,
and
hateth
his
brother,
is
in
darkness
even
until
now.
002:010
He
that
loveth
his
brother
abideth
in
the
light,
and
there
is
none
occasion
of
stumbling
in
him.
002:011
But
he
that
hateth
his
brother
is
in
darkness,
and
walketh
in
darkness,
and
knoweth
not
whither
he
goeth,
because
that
darkness
hath
blinded
his
eyes.
002:012
I
write
unto
you,
little
children,
because
your
sins
are
forgiven
you
for
his
name's
sake.
002:013
I
write
unto
you,
fathers,
because
ye
have
known
him
that
is
from
the
beginning.
I
write
unto
you,
young
men,
because
ye
have
overcome
the
wicked
one.
I
write
unto
you,
little
children,
because
ye
have
known
the
Father.
002:014
I
have
written
unto
you,
fathers,
because
ye
have
known
him
that
is
from
the
beginning.
I
have
written
unto
you,
young
men,
because
ye
are
strong,
and
the
word
of
God
abideth
in
you,
and
ye
have
overcome
the
wicked
one.
002:015
Love
not
the
world,
neither
the
things
that
are
in
the
world.
If
any
man
love
the
world,
the
love
of
the
Father
is
not
in
him.
002:016
For
all
that
is
in
the
world,
the
lust
of
the
flesh,
and
the
lust
of
the
eyes,
and
the
pride
of
life,
is
not
of
the
Father,
but
is
of
the
world.
002:017
And
the
world
passeth
away,
and
the
lust
thereof:
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
God
abideth
for
ever.
002:018
Little
children,
it
is
the
last
time:
and
as
ye
have
heard
that
antichrist
shall
come,
even
now
are
there
many
antichrists;
whereby
we
know
that
it
is
the
last
time.
002:019
They
went
out
from
us,
but
they
were
not
of
us;
for
if
they
had
been
of
us,
they
would
no
doubt
have
continued
with
us:
but
they
went
out,
that
they
might
be
made
manifest
that
they
were
not
all
of
us.
002:020
But
ye
have
an
unction
from
the
Holy
One,
and
ye
know
all
things.
002:021
I
have
not
written
unto
you
because
ye
know
not
the
truth,
but
because
ye
know
it,
and
that
no
lie
is
of
the
truth.
002:022
Who
is
a
liar
but
he
that
denieth
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ?
He
is
antichrist,
that
denieth
the
Father
and
the
Son.
002:023
Whosoever
denieth
the
Son,
the
same
hath
not
the
Father:
he
that
acknowledgeth
the
Son
hath
the
Father
also.
002:024
Let
that
therefore
abide
in
you,
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning.
If
that
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
shall
remain
in
you,
ye
also
shall
continue
in
the
Son,
and
in
the
Father.
002:025
And
this
is
the
promise
that
he
hath
promised
us,
even
eternal
life.
002:026
These
things
have
I
written
unto
you
concerning
them
that
seduce
you.
002:027
But
the
anointing
which
ye
have
received
of
him
abideth
in
you,
and
ye
need
not
that
any
man
teach
you:
but
as
the
same
anointing
teacheth
you
of
all
things,
and
is
truth,
and
is
no
lie,
and
even
as
it
hath
taught
you,
ye
shall
abide
in
him.
002:028
And
now,
little
children,
abide
in
him;
that,
when
he
shall
appear,
we
may
have
confidence,
and
not
be
ashamed
before
him
at
his
coming.
002:029
If
ye
know
that
he
is
righteous,
ye
know
that
every
one
that
doeth
righteousness
is
born
of
him.
003:001
Behold,
what
manner
of
love
the
Father
hath
bestowed
upon
us,
that
we
should
be
called
the
sons
of
God:
therefore
the
world
knoweth
us
not,
because
it
knew
him
not.
003:002
Beloved,
now
are
we
the
sons
of
God,
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be:
but
we
know
that,
when
he
shall
appear,
we
shall
be
like
him;
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is.
003:003
And
every
man
that
hath
this
hope
in
him
purifieth
himself,
even
as
he
is
pure.
003:004
Whosoever
committeth
sin
transgresseth
also
the
law:
for
sin
is
the
transgression
of
the
law.
003:005
And
ye
know
that
he
was
manifested
to
take
away
our
sins;
and
in
him
is
no
sin.
003:006
Whosoever
abideth
in
him
sinneth
not:
whosoever
sinneth
hath
not
seen
him,
neither
known
him.
003:007
Little
children,
let
no
man
deceive
you:
he
that
doeth
righteousness
is
righteous,
even
as
he
is
righteous.
003:008
He
that
committeth
sin
is
of
the
devil;
for
the
devil
sinneth
from
the
beginning.
For
this
purpose
the
Son
of
God
was
manifested,
that
he
might
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil.
003:009
Whosoever
is
born
of
God
doth
not
commit
sin;
for
his
seed
remaineth
in
him:
and
he
cannot
sin,
because
he
is
born
of
God.
003:010
In
this
the
children
of
God
are
manifest,
and
the
children
of
the
devil:
whosoever
doeth
not
righteousness
is
not
of
God,
neither
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother.
003:011
For
this
is
the
message
that
ye
heard
from
the
beginning,
that
we
should
love
one
another.
003:012
Not
as
Cain,
who
was
of
that
wicked
one,
and
slew
his
brother.
And
wherefore
slew
he
him?
Because
his
own
works
were
evil,
and
his
brother's
righteous.
003:013
Marvel
not,
my
brethren,
if
the
world
hate
you.
003:014
We
know
that
we
have
passed
from
death
unto
life,
because
we
love
the
brethren.
He
that
loveth
not
his
brother
abideth
in
death.
003:015
Whosoever
hateth
his
brother
is
a
murderer:
and
ye
know
that
no
murderer
hath
eternal
life
abiding
in
him.
003:016
Hereby
perceive
we
the
love
of
God,
because
he
laid
down
his
life
for
us:
and
we
ought
to
lay
down
our
lives
for
the
brethren.
003:017
But
whoso
hath
this
world's
good,
and
seeth
his
brother
have
need,
and
shutteth
up
his
bowels
of
compassion
from
him,
how
dwelleth
the
love
of
God
in
him?
003:018
My
little
children,
let
us
not
love
in
word,
neither
in
tongue;
but
in
deed
and
in
truth.
003:019
And
hereby
we
know
that
we
are
of
the
truth,
and
shall
assure
our
hearts
before
him.
003:020
For
if
our
heart
condemn
us,
God
is
greater
than
our
heart,
and
knoweth
all
things.
003:021
Beloved,
if
our
heart
condemn
us
not,
then
have
we
confidence
toward
God.
003:022
And
whatsoever
we
ask,
we
receive
of
him,
because
we
keep
his
commandments,
and
do
those
things
that
are
pleasing
in
his
sight.
003:023
And
this
is
his
commandment,
That
we
should
believe
on
the
name
of
his
Son
Jesus
Christ,
and
love
one
another,
as
he
gave
us
commandment.
003:024
And
he
that
keepeth
his
commandments
dwelleth
in
him,
and
he
in
him.
And
hereby
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us,
by
the
Spirit
which
he
hath
given
us.
004:001
Beloved,
believe
not
every
spirit,
but
try
the
spirits
whether
they
are
of
God:
because
many
false
prophets
are
gone
out
into
the
world.
004:002
Hereby
know
ye
the
Spirit
of
God:
Every
spirit
that
confesseth
that
Jesus
Christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
is
of
God:
004:003
And
every
spirit
that
confesseth
not
that
Jesus
Christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
is
not
of
God:
and
this
is
that
spirit
of
antichrist,
whereof
ye
have
heard
that
it
should
come;
and
even
now
already
is
it
in
the
world.
004:004
Ye
are
of
God,
little
children,
and
have
overcome
them:
because
greater
is
he
that
is
in
you,
than
he
that
is
in
the
world.
004:005
They
are
of
the
world:
therefore
speak
they
of
the
world,
and
the
world
heareth
them.
004:006
We
are
of
God:
he
that
knoweth
God
heareth
us;
he
that
is
not
of
God
heareth
not
us.
Hereby
know
we
the
spirit
of
truth,
and
the
spirit
of
error.
004:007
Beloved,
let
us
love
one
another:
for
love
is
of
God;
and
every
one
that
loveth
is
born
of
God,
and
knoweth
God.
004:008
He
that
loveth
not
knoweth
not
God;
for
God
is
love.
004:009
In
this
was
manifested
the
love
of
God
toward
us,
because
that
God
sent
his
only
begotten
Son
into
the
world,
that
we
might
live
through
him.
004:010
Herein
is
love,
not
that
we
loved
God,
but
that
he
loved
us,
and
sent
his
Son
to
be
the
propitiation
for
our
sins.
004:011
Beloved,
if
God
so
loved
us,
we
ought
also
to
love
one
another.
004:012
No
man
hath
seen
God
at
any
time.
If
we
love
one
another,
God
dwelleth
in
us,
and
his
love
is
perfected
in
us.
004:013
Hereby
know
we
that
we
dwell
in
him,
and
he
in
us,
because
he
hath
given
us
of
his
Spirit.
004:014
And
we
have
seen
and
do
testify
that
the
Father
sent
the
Son
to
be
the
Saviour
of
the
world.
004:015
Whosoever
shall
confess
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
of
God,
God
dwelleth
in
him,
and
he
in
God.
004:016
And
we
have
known
and
believed
the
love
that
God
hath
to
us.
God
is
love;
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
God,
and
God
in
him.
004:017
Herein
is
our
love
made
perfect,
that
we
may
have
boldness
in
the
day
of
judgment:
because
as
he
is,
so
are
we
in
this
world.
004:018
There
is
no
fear
in
love;
but
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear:
because
fear
hath
torment.
He
that
feareth
is
not
made
perfect
in
love.
004:019
We
love
him,
because
he
first
loved
us.
004:020
If
a
man
say,
I
love
God,
and
hateth
his
brother,
he
is
a
liar:
for
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
seen,
how
can
he
love
God
whom
he
hath
not
seen?
004:021
And
this
commandment
have
we
from
him,
That
he
who
loveth
God
love
his
brother
also.
005:001
Whosoever
believeth
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
is
born
of
God:
and
every
one
that
loveth
him
that
begat
loveth
him
also
that
is
begotten
of
him.
005:002
By
this
we
