know
that
we
love
the
children
of
God,
when
we
love
God,
and
keep
his
commandments.
005:003
For
this
is
the
love
of
God,
that
we
keep
his
commandments:
and
his
commandments
are
not
grievous.
005:004
For
whatsoever
is
born
of
God
overcometh
the
world:
and
this
is
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
world,
even
our
faith.
005:005
Who
is
he
that
overcometh
the
world,
but
he
that
believeth
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
of
God?
005:006
This
is
he
that
came
by
water
and
blood,
even
Jesus
Christ;
not
by
water
only,
but
by
water
and
blood.
And
it
is
the
Spirit
that
beareth
witness,
because
the
Spirit
is
truth.
005:007
For
there
are
three
that
bear
record
in
heaven,
the
Father,
the
Word,
and
the
Holy
Ghost:
and
these
three
are
one.
005:008
And
there
are
three
that
bear
witness
in
earth,
the
Spirit,
and
the
water,
and
the
blood:
and
these
three
agree
in
one.
005:009
If
we
receive
the
witness
of
men,
the
witness
of
God
is
greater:
for
this
is
the
witness
of
God
which
he
hath
testified
of
his
Son.
005:010
He
that
believeth
on
the
Son
of
God
hath
the
witness
in
himself:
he
that
believeth
not
God
hath
made
him
a
liar;
because
he
believeth
not
the
record
that
God
gave
of
his
Son.
005:011
And
this
is
the
record,
that
God
hath
given
to
us
eternal
life,
and
this
life
is
in
his
Son.
005:012
He
that
hath
the
Son
hath
life;
and
he
that
hath
not
the
Son
of
God
hath
not
life.
005:013
These
things
have
I
written
unto
you
that
believe
on
the
name
of
the
Son
of
God;
that
ye
may
know
that
ye
have
eternal
life,
and
that
ye
may
believe
on
the
name
of
the
Son
of
God.
005:014
And
this
is
the
confidence
that
we
have
in
him,
that,
if
we
ask
any
thing
according
to
his
will,
he
heareth
us:
005:015
And
if
we
know
that
he
hear
us,
whatsoever
we
ask,
we
know
that
we
have
the
petitions
that
we
desired
of
him.
005:016
If
any
man
see
his
brother
sin
a
sin
which
is
not
unto
death,
he
shall
ask,
and
he
shall
give
him
life
for
them
that
sin
not
unto
death.
There
is
a
sin
unto
death:
I
do
not
say
that
he
shall
pray
for
it.
005:017
All
unrighteousness
is
sin:
and
there
is
a
sin
not
unto
death.
005:018
We
know
that
whosoever
is
born
of
God
sinneth
not;
but
he
that
is
begotten
of
God
keepeth
himself,
and
that
wicked
one
toucheth
him
not.
005:019
And
we
know
that
we
are
of
God,
and
the
whole
world
lieth
in
wickedness.
005:020
And
we
know
that
the
Son
of
God
is
come,
and
hath
given
us
an
understanding,
that
we
may
know
him
that
is
true,
and
we
are
in
him
that
is
true,
even
in
his
Son
Jesus
Christ.
This
is
the
true
God,
and
eternal
life.
005:021
Little
children,
keep
yourselves
from
idols.
Amen.
Book
63	2
John
001:001
The
elder
unto
the
elect
lady
and
her
children,
whom
I
love
in
the
truth;
and
not
I
only,
but
also
all
they
that
have
known
the
truth;
001:002
For
the
truth's
sake,
which
dwelleth
in
us,
and
shall
be
with
us
for
ever.
001:003
Grace
be
with
you,
mercy,
and
peace,
from
God
the
Father,
and
from
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ,
the
Son
of
the
Father,
in
truth
and
love.
001:004
I
rejoiced
greatly
that
I
found
of
thy
children
walking
in
truth,
as
we
have
received
a
commandment
from
the
Father.
001:005
And
now
I
beseech
thee,
lady,
not
as
though
I
wrote
a
new
commandment
unto
thee,
but
that
which
we
had
from
the
beginning,
that
we
love
one
another.
001:006
And
this
is
love,
that
we
walk
after
his
commandments.
This
is
the
commandment,
That,
as
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning,
ye
should
walk
in
it.
001:007
For
many
deceivers
are
entered
into
the
world,
who
confess
not
that
Jesus
Christ
is
come
in
the
flesh.
This
is
a
deceiver
and
an
antichrist.
001:008
Look
to
yourselves,
that
we
lose
not
those
things
which
we
have
wrought,
but
that
we
receive
a
full
reward.
001:009
Whosoever
transgresseth,
and
abideth
not
in
the
doctrine
of
Christ,
hath
not
God.
He
that
abideth
in
the
doctrine
of
Christ,
he
hath
both
the
Father
and
the
Son.
001:010
If
there
come
any
unto
you,
and
bring
not
this
doctrine,
receive
him
not
into
your
house,
neither
bid
him
God
speed:
001:011
For
he
that
biddeth
him
God
speed
is
partaker
of
his
evil
deeds.
001:012
Having
many
things
to
write
unto
you,
I
would
not
write
with
paper
and
ink:
but
I
trust
to
come
unto
you,
and
speak
face
to
face,
that
our
joy
may
be
full.
001:013
The
children
of
thy
elect
sister
greet
thee.
Amen.
Book
64	3
John
001:001
The
elder
unto
the
wellbeloved
Gaius,
whom
I
love
in
the
truth.
001:002
Beloved,
I
wish
above
all
things
that
thou
mayest
prosper
and
be
in
health,
even
as
thy
soul
prospereth.
001:003
For
I
rejoiced
greatly,
when
the
brethren
came
and
testified
of
the
truth
that
is
in
thee,
even
as
thou
walkest
in
the
truth.
001:004
I
have
no
greater
joy
than
to
hear
that
my
children
walk
in
truth.
001:005
Beloved,
thou
doest
faithfully
whatsoever
thou
doest
to
the
brethren,
and
to
strangers;
001:006
Which
have
borne
witness
of
thy
charity
before
the
church:
whom
if
thou
bring
forward
on
their
journey
after
a
godly
sort,
thou
shalt
do
well:
001:007
Because
that
for
his
name's
sake
they
went
forth,
taking
nothing
of
the
Gentiles.
001:008
We
therefore
ought
to
receive
such,
that
we
might
be
fellowhelpers
to
the
truth.
001:009
I
wrote
unto
the
church:
but
Diotrephes,
who
loveth
to
have
the
preeminence
among
them,
receiveth
us
not.
001:010
Wherefore,
if
I
come,
I
will
remember
his
deeds
which
he
doeth,
prating
against
us
with
malicious
words:
and
not
content
therewith,
neither
doth
he
himself
receive
the
brethren,
and
forbiddeth
them
that
would,
and
casteth
them
out
of
the
church.
001:011
Beloved,
follow
not
that
which
is
evil,
but
that
which
is
good.
He
that
doeth
good
is
of
God:
but
he
that
doeth
evil
hath
not
seen
God.
001:012
Demetrius
hath
good
report
of
all
men,
and
of
the
truth
itself:
yea,
and
we
also
bear
record;
and
ye
know
that
our
record
is
true.
001:013
I
had
many
things
to
write,
but
I
will
not
with
ink
and
pen
write
unto
thee:
001:014
But
I
trust
I
shall
shortly
see
thee,
and
we
shall
speak
face
to
face.
Peace
be
to
thee.
Our
friends
salute
thee.
Greet
the
friends
by
name.
Book
65	Jude
001:001
Jude,
the
servant
of
Jesus
Christ,
and
brother
of
James,
to
them
that
are
sanctified
by
God
the
Father,
and
preserved
in
Jesus
Christ,
and
called:
001:002
Mercy
unto
you,
and
peace,
and
love,
be
multiplied.
001:003
Beloved,
when
I
gave
all
diligence
to
write
unto
you
of
the
common
salvation,
it
was
needful
for
me
to
write
unto
you,
and
exhort
you
that
ye
should
earnestly
contend
for
the
faith
which
was
once
delivered
unto
the
saints.
001:004
For
there
are
certain
men
crept
in
unawares,
who
were
before
of
old
ordained
to
this
condemnation,
ungodly
men,
turning
the
grace
of
our
God
into
lasciviousness,
and
denying
the
only
Lord
God,
and
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
001:005
I
will
therefore
put
you
in
remembrance,
though
ye
once
knew
this,
how
that
the
Lord,
having
saved
the
people
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
afterward
destroyed
them
that
believed
not.
001:006
And
the
angels
which
kept
not
their
first
estate,
but
left
their
own
habitation,
he
hath
reserved
in
everlasting
chains
under
darkness
unto
the
judgment
of
the
great
day.
001:007
Even
as
Sodom
and
Gomorrha,
and
the
cities
about
them
in
like
manner,
giving
themselves
over
to
fornication,
and
going
after
strange
flesh,
are
set
forth
for
an
example,
suffering
the
vengeance
of
eternal
fire.
001:008
Likewise
also
these
filthy
dreamers
defile
the
flesh,
despise
dominion,
and
speak
evil
of
dignities.
001:009
Yet
Michael
the
archangel,
when
contending
with
the
devil
he
disputed
about
the
body
of
Moses,
durst
not
bring
against
him
a
railing
accusation,
but
said,
The
Lord
rebuke
thee.
001:010
But
these
speak
evil
of
those
things
which
they
know
not:
but
what
they
know
naturally,
as
brute
beasts,
in
those
things
they
corrupt
themselves.
001:011
Woe
unto
them!
for
they
have
gone
in
the
way
of
Cain,
and
ran
greedily
after
the
error
of
Balaam
for
reward,
and
perished
in
the
gainsaying
of
Core.
001:012
These
are
spots
in
your
feasts
of
charity,
when
they
feast
with
you,
feeding
themselves
without
fear:
clouds
they
are
without
water,
carried
about
of
winds;
trees
whose
fruit
withereth,
without
fruit,
twice
dead,
plucked
up
by
the
roots;
001:013
Raging
waves
of
the
sea,
foaming
out
their
own
shame;
wandering
stars,
to
whom
is
reserved
the
blackness
of
darkness
for
ever.
001:014
And
Enoch
also,
the
seventh
from
Adam,
prophesied
of
these,
saying,
Behold,
the
Lord
cometh
with
ten
thousands
of
his
saints,
001:015
To
execute
judgment
upon
all,
and
to
convince
all
that
are
ungodly
among
them
of
all
their
ungodly
deeds
which
they
have
ungodly
committed,
and
of
all
their
hard
speeches
which
ungodly
sinners
have
spoken
against
him.
001:016
These
are
murmurers,
complainers,
walking
after
their
own
lusts;
and
their
mouth
speaketh
great
swelling
words,
having
men's
persons
in
admiration
because
of
advantage.
001:017
But,
beloved,
remember
ye
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
of
the
apostles
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ;
001:018
How
that
they
told
you
there
should
be
mockers
in
the
last
time,
who
should
walk
after
their
own
ungodly
lusts.
001:019
These
be
they
who
separate
themselves,
sensual,
having
not
the
Spirit.
001:020
But
ye,
beloved,
building
up
yourselves
on
your
most
holy
faith,
praying
in
the
Holy
Ghost,
001:021
Keep
yourselves
in
the
love
of
God,
looking
for
the
mercy
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
unto
eternal
life.
001:022
And
of
some
have
compassion,
making
a
difference:
001:023
And
others
save
with
fear,
pulling
them
out
of
the
fire;
hating
even
the
garment
spotted
by
the
flesh.
001:024
Now
unto
him
that
is
able
to
keep
you
from
falling,
and
to
present
you
faultless
before
the
presence
of
his
glory
with
exceeding
joy,
001:025
To
the
only
wise
God
our
Saviour,
be
glory
and
majesty,
dominion
and
power,
both
now
and
ever.
Amen.
Book
66	Revelation
001:001
The
Revelation
of
Jesus
Christ,
which
God
gave
unto
him,
to
shew
unto
his
servants
things
which
must
shortly
come
to
pass;
and
he
sent
and
signified
it
by
his
angel
unto
his
servant
John:
001:002
Who
bare
record
of
the
word
of
God,
and
of
the
testimony
of
Jesus
Christ,
and
of
all
things
that
he
saw.
001:003
Blessed
is
he
that
readeth,
and
they
that
hear
the
words
of
this
prophecy,
and
keep
those
things
which
are
written
therein:
for
the
time
is
at
hand.
001:004
John
to
the
seven
churches
which
are
in
Asia:
Grace
be
unto
you,
and
peace,
from
him
which
is,
and
which
was,
and
which
is
to
come;
and
from
the
seven
Spirits
which
are
before
his
throne;
001:005
And
from
Jesus
Christ,
who
is
the
faithful
witness,
and
the
first
begotten
of
the
dead,
and
the
prince
of
the
kings
of
the
earth.
Unto
him
that
loved
us,
and
washed
us
from
our
sins
in
his
own
blood,
001:006
And
hath
made
us
kings
and
priests
unto
God
and
his
Father;
to
him
be
glory
and
dominion
for
ever
and
ever.
Amen.
001:007
Behold,
he
cometh
with
clouds;
and
every
eye
shall
see
him,
and
they
also
which
pierced
him:
and
all
kindreds
of
the
earth
shall
wail
because
of
him.
Even
so,
Amen.
001:008
I
am
Alpha
and
Omega,
the
beginning
and
the
ending,
saith
the
Lord,
which
is,
and
which
was,
and
which
is
to
come,
the
Almighty.
001:009
I
John,
who
also
am
your
brother,
and
companion
in
tribulation,
and
in
the
kingdom
and
patience
of
Jesus
Christ,
was
in
the
isle
that
is
called
Patmos,
for
the
word
of
God,
and
for
the
testimony
of
Jesus
Christ.
001:010
I
was
in
the
Spirit
on
the
Lord's
day,
and
heard
behind
me
a
great
voice,
as
of
a
trumpet,
001:011
Saying,
I
am
Alpha
and
Omega,
the
first
and
the
last:
and,
What
thou
seest,
write
in
a
book,
and
send
it
unto
the
seven
churches
which
are
in
Asia;
unto
Ephesus,
and
unto
Smyrna,
and
unto
Pergamos,
and
unto
Thyatira,
and
unto
Sardis,
and
unto
Philadelphia,
and
unto
Laodicea.
001:012
And
I
turned
to
see
the
voice
that
spake
with
me.
And
being
turned,
I
saw
seven
golden
candlesticks;
001:013
And
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
candlesticks
one
like
unto
the
Son
of
man,
clothed
with
a
garment
down
to
the
foot,
and
girt
about
the
paps
with
a
golden
girdle.
001:014
His
head
and
his
hairs
were
white
like
wool,
as
white
as
snow;
and
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire;
001:015
And
his
feet
like
unto
fine
brass,
as
if
they
burned
in
a
furnace;
and
his
voice
as
the
sound
of
many
waters.
001:016
And
he
had
in
his
right
hand
seven
stars:
and
out
of
his
mouth
went
a
sharp
twoedged
sword:
and
his
countenance
was
as
the
sun
shineth
in
his
strength.
001:017
And
when
I
saw
him,
I
fell
at
his
feet
as
dead.
And
he
laid
his
right
hand
upon
me,
saying
unto
me,
Fear
not;
I
am
the
first
and
the
last:
001:018
I
am
he
that
liveth,
and
was
dead;
and,
behold,
I
am
alive
for
evermore,
Amen;
and
have
the
keys
of
hell
and
of
death.
001:019
Write
the
things
which
thou
hast
seen,
and
the
things
which
are,
and
the
things
which
shall
be
hereafter;
001:020
The
mystery
of
the
seven
stars
which
thou
sawest
in
my
right
hand,
and
the
seven
golden
candlesticks.
The
seven
stars
are
the
angels
of
the
seven
churches:
and
the
seven
candlesticks
which
thou
sawest
are
the
seven
churches.
002:001
Unto
the
angel
of
the
church
of
Ephesus
write;
These
things
saith
he
that
holdeth
the
seven
stars
in
his
right
hand,
who
walketh
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
golden
candlesticks;
002:002
I
know
thy
works,
and
thy
labour,
and
thy
patience,
and
how
thou
canst
not
bear
them
which
are
evil:
and
thou
hast
tried
them
which
say
they
are
apostles,
and
are
not,
and
hast
found
them
liars:
002:003
And
hast
borne,
and
hast
patience,
and
for
my
name's
sake
hast
laboured,
and
hast
not
fainted.
002:004
Nevertheless
I
have
somewhat
against
thee,
because
thou
hast
left
thy
first
love.
002:005
Remember
therefore
from
whence
thou
art
fallen,
and
repent,
and
do
the
first
works;
or
else
I
will
come
unto
thee
quickly,
and
will
remove
thy
candlestick
out
of
his
place,
except
thou
repent.
002:006
But
this
thou
hast,
that
thou
hatest
the
deeds
of
the
Nicolaitanes,
which
I
also
hate.
002:007
He
that
hath
an
ear,
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto
the
churches;
To
him
that
overcometh
will
I
give
to
eat
of
the
tree
of
life,
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
paradise
of
God.
002:008
And
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
in
Smyrna
write;
These
things
saith
the
first
and
the
last,
which
was
dead,
and
is
alive;
002:009
I
know
thy
works,
and
tribulation,
and
poverty,
(but
thou
art
rich)
and
I
know
the
blasphemy
of
them
which
say
they
are
Jews,
and
are
not,
but
are
the
synagogue
of
Satan.
002:010
Fear
none
of
those
things
which
thou
shalt
suffer:
behold,
the
devil
shall
cast
some
of
you
into
prison,
that
ye
may
be
tried;
and
ye
shall
have
tribulation
ten
days:
be
thou
faithful
unto
death,
and
I
will
give
thee
a
crown
of
life.
002:011
He
that
hath
an
ear,
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto
the
churches;
He
that
overcometh
shall
not
be
hurt
of
the
second
death.
002:012
And
to
the
angel
of
the
church
in
Pergamos
write;
These
things
saith
he
which
hath
the
sharp
sword
with
two
edges;
002:013
I
know
thy
works,
and
where
thou
dwellest,
even
where
Satan's
seat
is:
and
thou
holdest
fast
my
name,
and
hast
not
denied
my
faith,
even
in
those
days
wherein
Antipas
was
my
faithful
martyr,
who
was
slain
among
you,
where
Satan
dwelleth.
002:014
But
I
have
a
few
things
against
thee,
because
thou
hast
there
them
that
hold
the
doctrine
of
Balaam,
who
taught
Balac
to
cast
a
stumblingblock
before
the
children
of
Israel,
to
eat
things
sacrificed
unto
idols,
and
to
commit
fornication.
002:015
So
hast
thou
also
them
that
hold
the
doctrine
of
the
Nicolaitanes,
which
thing
I
hate.
002:016
Repent;
or
else
I
will
come
unto
thee
quickly,
and
will
fight
against
them
with
the
sword
of
my
mouth.
002:017
He
that
hath
an
ear,
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto
the
churches;
To
him
that
overcometh
will
I
give
to
eat
of
the
hidden
manna,
and
will
give
him
a
white
stone,
and
in
the
stone
a
new
name
written,
which
no
man
knoweth
saving
he
that
receiveth
it.
002:018
And
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
in
Thyatira
write;
These
things
saith
the
Son
of
God,
who
hath
his
eyes
like
unto
a
flame
of
fire,
and
his
feet
are
like
fine
brass;
002:019
I
know
thy
works,
and
charity,
and
service,
and
faith,
and
thy
patience,
and
thy
works;
and
the
last
to
be
more
than
the
first.
002:020
Notwithstanding
I
have
a
few
things
against
thee,
because
thou
sufferest
that
woman
Jezebel,
which
calleth
herself
a
prophetess,
to
teach
and
to
seduce
my
servants
to
commit
fornication,
and
to
eat
things
sacrificed
unto
idols.
002:021
And
I
gave
her
space
to
repent
of
her
fornication;
and
she
repented
not.
002:022
Behold,
I
will
cast
her
into
a
bed,
and
them
that
commit
adultery
with
her
into
great
tribulation,
except
they
repent
of
their
deeds.
002:023
And
I
will
kill
her
children
with
death;
and
all
the
churches
shall
know
that
I
am
he
which
searcheth
the
reins
and
hearts:
and
I
will
give
unto
every
one
of
you
according
to
your
works.
002:024
But
unto
you
I
say,
and
unto
the
rest
in
Thyatira,
as
many
as
have
not
this
doctrine,
and
which
have
not
known
the
depths
of
Satan,
as
they
speak;
I
will
put
upon
you
none
other
burden.
002:025
But
that
which
ye
have
already
hold
fast
till
I
come.
002:026
And
he
that
overcometh,
and
keepeth
my
works
unto
the
end,
to
him
will
I
give
power
over
the
nations:
002:027
And
he
shall
rule
them
with
a
rod
of
iron;
as
the
vessels
of
a
potter
shall
they
be
broken
to
shivers:
even
as
I
received
of
my
Father.
002:028
And
I
will
give
him
the
morning
star.
002:029
He
that
hath
an
ear,
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto
the
churches.
003:001
And
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
in
Sardis
write;
These
things
saith
he
that
hath
the
seven
Spirits
of
God,
and
the
seven
stars;
I
know
thy
works,
that
thou
hast
a
name
that
thou
livest,
and
art
dead.
003:002
Be
watchful,
and
strengthen
the
things
which
remain,
that
are
ready
to
die:
for
I
have
not
found
thy
works
perfect
before
God.
003:003
Remember
therefore
how
thou
hast
received
and
heard,
and
hold
fast,
and
repent.
If
therefore
thou
shalt
not
watch,
I
will
come
on
thee
as
a
thief,
and
thou
shalt
not
know
what
hour
I
will
come
upon
thee.
003:004
Thou
hast
a
few
names
even
in
Sardis
which
have
not
defiled
their
garments;
and
they
shall
walk
with
me
in
white:
for
they
are
worthy.
003:005
He
that
overcometh,
the
same
shall
be
clothed
in
white
raiment;
and
I
will
not
blot
out
his
name
out
of
the
book
of
life,
but
I
will
confess
his
name
before
my
Father,
and
before
his
angels.
003:006
He
that
hath
an
ear,
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto
the
churches.
003:007
And
to
the
angel
of
the
church
in
Philadelphia
write;
These
things
saith
he
that
is
holy,
he
that
is
true,
he
that
hath
the
key
of
David,
he
that
openeth,
and
no
man
shutteth;
and
shutteth,
and
no
man
openeth;
003:008
I
know
thy
works:
behold,
I
have
set
before
thee
an
open
door,
and
no
man
can
shut
it:
for
thou
hast
a
little
strength,
and
hast
kept
my
word,
and
hast
not
denied
my
name.
003:009
Behold,
I
will
make
them
of
the
synagogue
of
Satan,
which
say
they
are
Jews,
and
are
not,
but
do
lie;
behold,
I
will
make
them
to
come
and
worship
before
thy
feet,
and
to
know
that
I
have
loved
thee.
003:010
Because
thou
hast
kept
the
word
of
my
patience,
I
also
will
keep
thee
from
the
hour
of
temptation,
which
shall
come
upon
all
the
world,
to
try
them
that
dwell
upon
the
earth.
003:011
Behold,
I
come
quickly:
hold
that
fast
which
thou
hast,
that
no
man
take
thy
crown.
003:012
Him
that
overcometh
will
I
make
a
pillar
in
the
temple
of
my
God,
and
he
shall
go
no
more
out:
and
I
will
write
upon
him
the
name
of
my
God,
and
the
name
of
the
city
of
my
God,
which
is
new
Jerusalem,
which
cometh
down
out
of
heaven
from
my
God:
and
I
will
write
upon
him
my
new
name.
003:013
He
that
hath
an
ear,
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto
the
churches.
003:014
And
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
of
the
Laodiceans
write;
These
things
saith
the
Amen,
the
faithful
and
true
witness,
the
beginning
of
the
creation
of
God;
003:015
I
know
thy
works,
that
thou
art
neither
cold
nor
hot:
I
would
thou
wert
cold
or
hot.
003:016
So
then
because
thou
art
lukewarm,
and
neither
cold
nor
hot,
I
will
spue
thee
out
of
my
mouth.
003:017
Because
thou
sayest,
I
am
rich,
and
increased
with
goods,
and
have
need
of
nothing;
and
knowest
not
that
thou
art
wretched,
and
miserable,
and
poor,
and
blind,
and
naked:
003:018
I
counsel
thee
to
buy
of
me
gold
tried
in
the
fire,
that
thou
mayest
be
rich;
and
white
raiment,
that
thou
mayest
be
clothed,
and
that
the
shame
of
thy
nakedness
do
not
appear;
and
anoint
thine
eyes
with
eyesalve,
that
thou
mayest
see.
003:019
As
many
as
I
love,
I
rebuke
and
chasten:
be
zealous
therefore,
and
repent.
003:020
Behold,
I
stand
at
the
door,
and
knock:
if
any
man
hear
my
voice,
and
open
the
door,
I
will
come
in
to
him,
and
will
sup
with
him,
and
he
with
me.
003:021
To
him
that
overcometh
will
I
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
throne,
even
as
I
also
overcame,
and
am
set
down
with
my
Father
in
his
throne.
003:022
He
that
hath
an
ear,
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto
the
churches.
004:001
After
this
I
looked,
and,
behold,
a
door
was
opened
in
heaven:
and
the
first
voice
which
I
heard
was
as
it
were
of
a
trumpet
talking
with
me;
which
said,
Come
up
hither,
and
I
will
shew
thee
things
which
must
be
hereafter.
004:002
And
immediately
I
was
in
the
spirit:
and,
behold,
a
throne
was
set
in
heaven,
and
one
sat
on
the
throne.
004:003
And
he
that
sat
was
to
look
upon
like
a
jasper
and
a
sardine
stone:
and
there
was
a
rainbow
round
about
the
throne,
in
sight
like
unto
an
emerald.
004:004
And
round
about
the
throne
were
four
and
twenty
seats:
and
upon
the
seats
I
saw
four
and
twenty
elders
sitting,
clothed
in
white
raiment;
and
they
had
on
their
heads
crowns
of
gold.
004:005
And
out
of
the
throne
proceeded
lightnings
and
thunderings
and
voices:
and
there
were
seven
lamps
of
fire
burning
before
the
throne,
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
of
God.
004:006
And
before
the
throne
there
was
a
sea
of
glass
like
unto
crystal:
and
in
the
midst
of
the
throne,
and
round
about
the
throne,
were
four
beasts
full
of
eyes
before
and
behind.
004:007
And
the
first
