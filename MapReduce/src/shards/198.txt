beast
was
like
a
lion,
and
the
second
beast
like
a
calf,
and
the
third
beast
had
a
face
as
a
man,
and
the
fourth
beast
was
like
a
flying
eagle.
004:008
And
the
four
beasts
had
each
of
them
six
wings
about
him;
and
they
were
full
of
eyes
within:
and
they
rest
not
day
and
night,
saying,
Holy,
holy,
holy,
LORD
God
Almighty,
which
was,
and
is,
and
is
to
come.
004:009
And
when
those
beasts
give
glory
and
honour
and
thanks
to
him
that
sat
on
the
throne,
who
liveth
for
ever
and
ever,
004:010
The
four
and
twenty
elders
fall
down
before
him
that
sat
on
the
throne,
and
worship
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever,
and
cast
their
crowns
before
the
throne,
saying,
004:011
Thou
art
worthy,
O
Lord,
to
receive
glory
and
honour
and
power:
for
thou
hast
created
all
things,
and
for
thy
pleasure
they
are
and
were
created.
005:001
And
I
saw
in
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
a
book
written
within
and
on
the
backside,
sealed
with
seven
seals.
005:002
And
I
saw
a
strong
angel
proclaiming
with
a
loud
voice,
Who
is
worthy
to
open
the
book,
and
to
loose
the
seals
thereof?
005:003
And
no
man
in
heaven,
nor
in
earth,
neither
under
the
earth,
was
able
to
open
the
book,
neither
to
look
thereon.
005:004
And
I
wept
much,
because
no
man
was
found
worthy
to
open
and
to
read
the
book,
neither
to
look
thereon.
005:005
And
one
of
the
elders
saith
unto
me,
Weep
not:
behold,
the
Lion
of
the
tribe
of
Juda,
the
Root
of
David,
hath
prevailed
to
open
the
book,
and
to
loose
the
seven
seals
thereof.
005:006
And
I
beheld,
and,
lo,
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
of
the
four
beasts,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
elders,
stood
a
Lamb
as
it
had
been
slain,
having
seven
horns
and
seven
eyes,
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
of
God
sent
forth
into
all
the
earth.
005:007
And
he
came
and
took
the
book
out
of
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
throne.
005:008
And
when
he
had
taken
the
book,
the
four
beasts
and
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
before
the
Lamb,
having
every
one
of
them
harps,
and
golden
vials
full
of
odours,
which
are
the
prayers
of
saints.
005:009
And
they
sung
a
new
song,
saying,
Thou
art
worthy
to
take
the
book,
and
to
open
the
seals
thereof:
for
thou
wast
slain,
and
hast
redeemed
us
to
God
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
kindred,
and
tongue,
and
people,
and
nation;
005:010
And
hast
made
us
unto
our
God
kings
and
priests:
and
we
shall
reign
on
the
earth.
005:011
And
I
beheld,
and
I
heard
the
voice
of
many
angels
round
about
the
throne
and
the
beasts
and
the
elders:
and
the
number
of
them
was
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand,
and
thousands
of
thousands;
005:012
Saying
with
a
loud
voice,
Worthy
is
the
Lamb
that
was
slain
to
receive
power,
and
riches,
and
wisdom,
and
strength,
and
honour,
and
glory,
and
blessing.
005:013
And
every
creature
which
is
in
heaven,
and
on
the
earth,
and
under
the
earth,
and
such
as
are
in
the
sea,
and
all
that
are
in
them,
heard
I
saying,
Blessing,
and
honour,
and
glory,
and
power,
be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne,
and
unto
the
Lamb
for
ever
and
ever.
005:014
And
the
four
beasts
said,
Amen.
And
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever.
006:001
And
I
saw
when
the
Lamb
opened
one
of
the
seals,
and
I
heard,
as
it
were
the
noise
of
thunder,
one
of
the
four
beasts
saying,
Come
and
see.
006:002
And
I
saw,
and
behold
a
white
horse:
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
bow;
and
a
crown
was
given
unto
him:
and
he
went
forth
conquering,
and
to
conquer.
006:003
And
when
he
had
opened
the
second
seal,
I
heard
the
second
beast
say,
Come
and
see.
006:004
And
there
went
out
another
horse
that
was
red:
and
power
was
given
to
him
that
sat
thereon
to
take
peace
from
the
earth,
and
that
they
should
kill
one
another:
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
great
sword.
006:005
And
when
he
had
opened
the
third
seal,
I
heard
the
third
beast
say,
Come
and
see.
And
I
beheld,
and
lo
a
black
horse;
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
pair
of
balances
in
his
hand.
006:006
And
I
heard
a
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
four
beasts
say,
A
measure
of
wheat
for
a
penny,
and
three
measures
of
barley
for
a
penny;
and
see
thou
hurt
not
the
oil
and
the
wine.
006:007
And
when
he
had
opened
the
fourth
seal,
I
heard
the
voice
of
the
fourth
beast
say,
Come
and
see.
006:008
And
I
looked,
and
behold
a
pale
horse:
and
his
name
that
sat
on
him
was
Death,
and
Hell
followed
with
him.
And
power
was
given
unto
them
over
the
fourth
part
of
the
earth,
to
kill
with
sword,
and
with
hunger,
and
with
death,
and
with
the
beasts
of
the
earth.
006:009
And
when
he
had
opened
the
fifth
seal,
I
saw
under
the
altar
the
souls
of
them
that
were
slain
for
the
word
of
God,
and
for
the
testimony
which
they
held:
006:010
And
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
saying,
How
long,
O
Lord,
holy
and
true,
dost
thou
not
judge
and
avenge
our
blood
on
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth?
006:011
And
white
robes
were
given
unto
every
one
of
them;
and
it
was
said
unto
them,
that
they
should
rest
yet
for
a
little
season,
until
their
fellowservants
also
and
their
brethren,
that
should
be
killed
as
they
were,
should
be
fulfilled.
006:012
And
I
beheld
when
he
had
opened
the
sixth
seal,
and,
lo,
there
was
a
great
earthquake;
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackcloth
of
hair,
and
the
moon
became
as
blood;
006:013
And
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
unto
the
earth,
even
as
a
fig
tree
casteth
her
untimely
figs,
when
she
is
shaken
of
a
mighty
wind.
006:014
And
the
heaven
departed
as
a
scroll
when
it
is
rolled
together;
and
every
mountain
and
island
were
moved
out
of
their
places.
006:015
And
the
kings
of
the
earth,
and
the
great
men,
and
the
rich
men,
and
the
chief
captains,
and
the
mighty
men,
and
every
bondman,
and
every
free
man,
hid
themselves
in
the
dens
and
in
the
rocks
of
the
mountains;
006:016
And
said
to
the
mountains
and
rocks,
Fall
on
us,
and
hide
us
from
the
face
of
him
that
sitteth
on
the
throne,
and
from
the
wrath
of
the
Lamb:
006:017
For
the
great
day
of
his
wrath
is
come;
and
who
shall
be
able
to
stand?
007:001
And
after
these
things
I
saw
four
angels
standing
on
the
four
corners
of
the
earth,
holding
the
four
winds
of
the
earth,
that
the
wind
should
not
blow
on
the
earth,
nor
on
the
sea,
nor
on
any
tree.
007:002
And
I
saw
another
angel
ascending
from
the
east,
having
the
seal
of
the
living
God:
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
four
angels,
to
whom
it
was
given
to
hurt
the
earth
and
the
sea,
007:003
Saying,
Hurt
not
the
earth,
neither
the
sea,
nor
the
trees,
till
we
have
sealed
the
servants
of
our
God
in
their
foreheads.
007:004
And
I
heard
the
number
of
them
which
were
sealed:
and
there
were
sealed
an
hundred
and
forty
and
four
thousand
of
all
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
Israel.
007:005
Of
the
tribe
of
Juda
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
Of
the
tribe
of
Reuben
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
Of
the
tribe
of
Gad
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
007:006
Of
the
tribe
of
Aser
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
Of
the
tribe
of
Nephthalim
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
Of
the
tribe
of
Manasses
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
007:007
Of
the
tribe
of
Simeon
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
Of
the
tribe
of
Levi
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
Of
the
tribe
of
Issachar
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
007:008
Of
the
tribe
of
Zabulon
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
Of
the
tribe
of
Joseph
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
Of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
were
sealed
twelve
thousand.
007:009
After
this
I
beheld,
and,
lo,
a
great
multitude,
which
no
man
could
number,
of
all
nations,
and
kindreds,
and
people,
and
tongues,
stood
before
the
throne,
and
before
the
Lamb,
clothed
with
white
robes,
and
palms
in
their
hands;
007:010
And
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
saying,
Salvation
to
our
God
which
sitteth
upon
the
throne,
and
unto
the
Lamb.
007:011
And
all
the
angels
stood
round
about
the
throne,
and
about
the
elders
and
the
four
beasts,
and
fell
before
the
throne
on
their
faces,
and
worshipped
God,
007:012
Saying,
Amen:
Blessing,
and
glory,
and
wisdom,
and
thanksgiving,
and
honour,
and
power,
and
might,
be
unto
our
God
for
ever
and
ever.
Amen.
007:013
And
one
of
the
elders
answered,
saying
unto
me,
What
are
these
which
are
arrayed
in
white
robes?
and
whence
came
they?
007:014
And
I
said
unto
him,
Sir,
thou
knowest.
And
he
said
to
me,
These
are
they
which
came
out
of
great
tribulation,
and
have
washed
their
robes,
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
Lamb.
007:015
Therefore
are
they
before
the
throne
of
God,
and
serve
him
day
and
night
in
his
temple:
and
he
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
shall
dwell
among
them.
007:016
They
shall
hunger
no
more,
neither
thirst
any
more;
neither
shall
the
sun
light
on
them,
nor
any
heat.
007:017
For
the
Lamb
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
shall
feed
them,
and
shall
lead
them
unto
living
fountains
of
waters:
and
God
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes.
008:001
And
when
he
had
opened
the
seventh
seal,
there
was
silence
in
heaven
about
the
space
of
half
an
hour.
008:002
And
I
saw
the
seven
angels
which
stood
before
God;
and
to
them
were
given
seven
trumpets.
008:003
And
another
angel
came
and
stood
at
the
altar,
having
a
golden
censer;
and
there
was
given
unto
him
much
incense,
that
he
should
offer
it
with
the
prayers
of
all
saints
upon
the
golden
altar
which
was
before
the
throne.
008:004
And
the
smoke
of
the
incense,
which
came
with
the
prayers
of
the
saints,
ascended
up
before
God
out
of
the
angel's
hand.
008:005
And
the
angel
took
the
censer,
and
filled
it
with
fire
of
the
altar,
and
cast
it
into
the
earth:
and
there
were
voices,
and
thunderings,
and
lightnings,
and
an
earthquake.
008:006
And
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
to
sound.
008:007
The
first
angel
sounded,
and
there
followed
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
blood,
and
they
were
cast
upon
the
earth:
and
the
third
part
of
trees
was
burnt
up,
and
all
green
grass
was
burnt
up.
008:008
And
the
second
angel
sounded,
and
as
it
were
a
great
mountain
burning
with
fire
was
cast
into
the
sea:
and
the
third
part
of
the
sea
became
blood;
008:009
And
the
third
part
of
the
creatures
which
were
in
the
sea,
and
had
life,
died;
and
the
third
part
of
the
ships
were
destroyed.
008:010
And
the
third
angel
sounded,
and
there
fell
a
great
star
from
heaven,
burning
as
it
were
a
lamp,
and
it
fell
upon
the
third
part
of
the
rivers,
and
upon
the
fountains
of
waters;
008:011
And
the
name
of
the
star
is
called
Wormwood:
and
the
third
part
of
the
waters
became
wormwood;
and
many
men
died
of
the
waters,
because
they
were
made
bitter.
008:012
And
the
fourth
angel
sounded,
and
the
third
part
of
the
sun
was
smitten,
and
the
third
part
of
the
moon,
and
the
third
part
of
the
stars;
so
as
the
third
part
of
them
was
darkened,
and
the
day
shone
not
for
a
third
part
of
it,
and
the
night
likewise.
008:013
And
I
beheld,
and
heard
an
angel
flying
through
the
midst
of
heaven,
saying
with
a
loud
voice,
Woe,
woe,
woe,
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
by
reason
of
the
other
voices
of
the
trumpet
of
the
three
angels,
which
are
yet
to
sound!
009:001
And
the
fifth
angel
sounded,
and
I
saw
a
star
fall
from
heaven
unto
the
earth:
and
to
him
was
given
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit.
009:002
And
he
opened
the
bottomless
pit;
and
there
arose
a
smoke
out
of
the
pit,
as
the
smoke
of
a
great
furnace;
and
the
sun
and
the
air
were
darkened
by
reason
of
the
smoke
of
the
pit.
009:003
And
there
came
out
of
the
smoke
locusts
upon
the
earth:
and
unto
them
was
given
power,
as
the
scorpions
of
the
earth
have
power.
009:004
And
it
was
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
hurt
the
grass
of
the
earth,
neither
any
green
thing,
neither
any
tree;
but
only
those
men
which
have
not
the
seal
of
God
in
their
foreheads.
009:005
And
to
them
it
was
given
that
they
should
not
kill
them,
but
that
they
should
be
tormented
five
months:
and
their
torment
was
as
the
torment
of
a
scorpion,
when
he
striketh
a
man.
009:006
And
in
those
days
shall
men
seek
death,
and
shall
not
find
it;
and
shall
desire
to
die,
and
death
shall
flee
from
them.
009:007
And
the
shapes
of
the
locusts
were
like
unto
horses
prepared
unto
battle;
and
on
their
heads
were
as
it
were
crowns
like
gold,
and
their
faces
were
as
the
faces
of
men.
009:008
And
they
had
hair
as
the
hair
of
women,
and
their
teeth
were
as
the
teeth
of
lions.
009:009
And
they
had
breastplates,
as
it
were
breastplates
of
iron;
and
the
sound
of
their
wings
was
as
the
sound
of
chariots
of
many
horses
running
to
battle.
009:010
And
they
had
tails
like
unto
scorpions,
and
there
were
stings
in
their
tails:
and
their
power
was
to
hurt
men
five
months.
009:011
And
they
had
a
king
over
them,
which
is
the
angel
of
the
bottomless
pit,
whose
name
in
the
Hebrew
tongue
is
Abaddon,
but
in
the
Greek
tongue
hath
his
name
Apollyon.
009:012
One
woe
is
past;
and,
behold,
there
come
two
woes
more
hereafter.
009:013
And
the
sixth
angel
sounded,
and
I
heard
a
voice
from
the
four
horns
of
the
golden
altar
which
is
before
God,
009:014
Saying
to
the
sixth
angel
which
had
the
trumpet,
Loose
the
four
angels
which
are
bound
in
the
great
river
Euphrates.
009:015
And
the
four
angels
were
loosed,
which
were
prepared
for
an
hour,
and
a
day,
and
a
month,
and
a
year,
for
to
slay
the
third
part
of
men.
009:016
And
the
number
of
the
army
of
the
horsemen
were
two
hundred
thousand
thousand:
and
I
heard
the
number
of
them.
009:017
And
thus
I
saw
the
horses
in
the
vision,
and
them
that
sat
on
them,
having
breastplates
of
fire,
and
of
jacinth,
and
brimstone:
and
the
heads
of
the
horses
were
as
the
heads
of
lions;
and
out
of
their
mouths
issued
fire
and
smoke
and
brimstone.
009:018
By
these
three
was
the
third
part
of
men
killed,
by
the
fire,
and
by
the
smoke,
and
by
the
brimstone,
which
issued
out
of
their
mouths.
009:019
For
their
power
is
in
their
mouth,
and
in
their
tails:
for
their
tails
were
like
unto
serpents,
and
had
heads,
and
with
them
they
do
hurt.
009:020
And
the
rest
of
the
men
which
were
not
killed
by
these
plagues
yet
repented
not
of
the
works
of
their
hands,
that
they
should
not
worship
devils,
and
idols
of
gold,
and
silver,
and
brass,
and
stone,
and
of
wood:
which
neither
can
see,
nor
hear,
nor
walk:
009:021
Neither
repented
they
of
their
murders,
nor
of
their
sorceries,
nor
of
their
fornication,
nor
of
their
thefts.
010:001
And
I
saw
another
mighty
angel
come
down
from
heaven,
clothed
with
a
cloud:
and
a
rainbow
was
upon
his
head,
and
his
face
was
as
it
were
the
sun,
and
his
feet
as
pillars
of
fire:
010:002
And
he
had
in
his
hand
a
little
book
open:
and
he
set
his
right
foot
upon
the
sea,
and
his
left
foot
on
the
earth,
010:003
And
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
as
when
a
lion
roareth:
and
when
he
had
cried,
seven
thunders
uttered
their
voices.
010:004
And
when
the
seven
thunders
had
uttered
their
voices,
I
was
about
to
write:
and
I
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me,
Seal
up
those
things
which
the
seven
thunders
uttered,
and
write
them
not.
010:005
And
the
angel
which
I
saw
stand
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
lifted
up
his
hand
to
heaven,
010:006
And
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever,
who
created
heaven,
and
the
things
that
therein
are,
and
the
earth,
and
the
things
that
therein
are,
and
the
sea,
and
the
things
which
are
therein,
that
there
should
be
time
no
longer:
010:007
But
in
the
days
of
the
voice
of
the
seventh
angel,
when
he
shall
begin
to
sound,
the
mystery
of
God
should
be
finished,
as
he
hath
declared
to
his
servants
the
prophets.
010:008
And
the
voice
which
I
heard
from
heaven
spake
unto
me
again,
and
said,
Go
and
take
the
little
book
which
is
open
in
the
hand
of
the
angel
which
standeth
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth.
010:009
And
I
went
unto
the
angel,
and
said
unto
him,
Give
me
the
little
book.
And
he
said
unto
me,
Take
it,
and
eat
it
up;
and
it
shall
make
thy
belly
bitter,
but
it
shall
be
in
thy
mouth
sweet
as
honey.
010:010
And
I
took
the
little
book
out
of
the
angel's
hand,
and
ate
it
up;
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
sweet
as
honey:
and
as
soon
as
I
had
eaten
it,
my
belly
was
bitter.
010:011
And
he
said
unto
me,
Thou
must
prophesy
again
before
many
peoples,
and
nations,
and
tongues,
and
kings.
011:001
And
there
was
given
me
a
reed
like
unto
a
rod:
and
the
angel
stood,
saying,
Rise,
and
measure
the
temple
of
God,
and
the
altar,
and
them
that
worship
therein.
011:002
But
the
court
which
is
without
the
temple
leave
out,
and
measure
it
not;
for
it
is
given
unto
the
Gentiles:
and
the
holy
city
shall
they
tread
under
foot
forty
and
two
months.
011:003
And
I
will
give
power
unto
my
two
witnesses,
and
they
shall
prophesy
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days,
clothed
in
sackcloth.
011:004
These
are
the
two
olive
trees,
and
the
two
candlesticks
standing
before
the
God
of
the
earth.
011:005
And
if
any
man
will
hurt
them,
fire
proceedeth
out
of
their
mouth,
and
devoureth
their
enemies:
and
if
any
man
will
hurt
them,
he
must
in
this
manner
be
killed.
011:006
These
have
power
to
shut
heaven,
that
it
rain
not
in
the
days
of
their
prophecy:
and
have
power
over
waters
to
turn
them
to
blood,
and
to
smite
the
earth
with
all
plagues,
as
often
as
they
will.
011:007
And
when
they
shall
have
finished
their
testimony,
the
beast
that
ascendeth
out
of
the
bottomless
pit
shall
make
war
against
them,
and
shall
overcome
them,
and
kill
them.
011:008
And
their
dead
bodies
shall
lie
in
the
street
of
the
great
city,
which
spiritually
is
called
Sodom
and
Egypt,
where
also
our
Lord
was
crucified.
011:009
And
they
of
the
people
and
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
shall
see
their
dead
bodies
three
days
and
an
half,
and
shall
not
suffer
their
dead
bodies
to
be
put
in
graves.
011:010
And
they
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
rejoice
over
them,
and
make
merry,
and
shall
send
gifts
one
to
another;
because
these
two
prophets
tormented
them
that
dwelt
on
the
earth.
011:011
And
after
three
days
and
an
half
the
spirit
of
life
from
God
entered
into
them,
and
they
stood
upon
their
feet;
and
great
fear
fell
upon
them
which
saw
them.
011:012
And
they
heard
a
great
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
them,
Come
up
hither.
And
they
ascended
up
to
heaven
in
a
cloud;
and
their
enemies
beheld
them.
011:013
And
the
same
hour
was
there
a
great
earthquake,
and
the
tenth
part
of
the
city
fell,
and
in
the
earthquake
were
slain
of
men
seven
thousand:
and
the
remnant
were
affrighted,
and
gave
glory
to
the
God
of
heaven.
011:014
The
second
woe
is
past;
and,
behold,
the
third
woe
cometh
quickly.
011:015
And
the
seventh
angel
sounded;
and
there
were
great
voices
in
heaven,
saying,
The
kingdoms
of
this
world
are
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
Lord,
and
of
his
Christ;
and
he
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever.
011:016
And
the
four
and
twenty
elders,
which
sat
before
God
on
their
seats,
fell
upon
their
faces,
and
worshipped
God,
011:017
Saying,
We
give
thee
thanks,
O
LORD
God
Almighty,
which
art,
and
wast,
and
art
to
come;
because
thou
hast
taken
to
thee
thy
great
power,
and
hast
reigned.
011:018
And
the
nations
were
angry,
and
thy
wrath
is
come,
and
the
time
of
the
dead,
that
they
should
be
judged,
and
that
thou
shouldest
give
reward
unto
thy
servants
the
prophets,
and
to
the
saints,
and
them
that
fear
thy
name,
small
and
great;
and
shouldest
destroy
them
which
destroy
the
earth.
011:019
And
the
temple
of
God
was
opened
in
heaven,
and
there
was
seen
in
his
temple
the
ark
of
his
testament:
and
there
were
lightnings,
and
voices,
and
thunderings,
and
an
earthquake,
and
great
hail.
012:001
And
there
appeared
a
great
wonder
in
heaven;
a
woman
clothed
with
the
sun,
and
the
moon
under
her
feet,
and
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
twelve
stars:
012:002
And
she
being
with
child
cried,
travailing
in
birth,
and
pained
to
be
delivered.
012:003
And
there
appeared
another
wonder
in
heaven;
and
behold
a
great
red
dragon,
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns,
and
seven
crowns
upon
his
heads.
012:004
And
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
heaven,
and
did
cast
them
to
the
earth:
and
the
dragon
stood
before
the
woman
which
was
ready
to
be
delivered,
for
to
devour
her
child
as
soon
as
it
was
born.
012:005
And
she
brought
forth
a
man
child,
who
was
to
rule
all
nations
with
a
rod
of
iron:
and
her
child
was
caught
up
unto
God,
and
to
his
throne.
012:006
And
the
woman
fled
into
the
wilderness,
where
she
hath
a
place
prepared
of
God,
that
they
should
feed
her
there
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days.
012:007
And
there
was
war
in
heaven:
Michael
and
his
angels
fought
against
the
dragon;
and
the
dragon
fought
and
his
angels,
012:008
And
prevailed
not;
neither
was
their
place
found
any
more
in
heaven.
012:009
And
the
great
dragon
was
cast
out,
that
old
serpent,
called
the
Devil,
and
Satan,
which
deceiveth
the
whole
world:
he
was
cast
out
into
the
earth,
and
his
angels
were
cast
out
with
him.
012:010
And
I
heard
a
loud
voice
saying
in
heaven,
Now
is
come
salvation,
and
strength,
and
the
kingdom
of
our
God,
and
the
power
of
his
Christ:
for
the
accuser
of
our
brethren
is
cast
down,
which
accused
them
before
our
God
day
and
night.
012:011
And
they
overcame
him
by
the
blood
of
the
Lamb,
and
by
the
word
of
their
testimony;
and
they
loved
not
their
lives
unto
the
death.
012:012
Therefore
rejoice,
ye
heavens,
and
ye
that
dwell
in
them.
Woe
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
and
of
the
sea!
for
the
devil
is
come
down
unto
you,
having
great
wrath,
because
he
knoweth
that
he
hath
but
a
short
time.
012:013
And
when
the
dragon
saw
that
he
was
cast
unto
the
earth,
he
persecuted
the
woman
which
brought
forth
the
man
child.
012:014
And
to
the
woman
were
given
two
wings
of
a
great
eagle,
that
she
might
fly
into
the
wilderness,
into
her
place,
where
she
is
nourished
for
a
time,
and
times,
and
half
a
time,
from
the
face
of
the
serpent.
012:015
And
the
serpent
cast
out
of
his
mouth
water
as
a
