flood
after
the
woman,
that
he
might
cause
her
to
be
carried
away
of
the
flood.
012:016
And
the
earth
helped
the
woman,
and
the
earth
opened
her
mouth,
and
swallowed
up
the
flood
which
the
dragon
cast
out
of
his
mouth.
012:017
And
the
dragon
was
wroth
with
the
woman,
and
went
to
make
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
seed,
which
keep
the
commandments
of
God,
and
have
the
testimony
of
Jesus
Christ.
013:001
And
I
stood
upon
the
sand
of
the
sea,
and
saw
a
beast
rise
up
out
of
the
sea,
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns,
and
upon
his
horns
ten
crowns,
and
upon
his
heads
the
name
of
blasphemy.
013:002
And
the
beast
which
I
saw
was
like
unto
a
leopard,
and
his
feet
were
as
the
feet
of
a
bear,
and
his
mouth
as
the
mouth
of
a
lion:
and
the
dragon
gave
him
his
power,
and
his
seat,
and
great
authority.
013:003
And
I
saw
one
of
his
heads
as
it
were
wounded
to
death;
and
his
deadly
wound
was
healed:
and
all
the
world
wondered
after
the
beast.
013:004
And
they
worshipped
the
dragon
which
gave
power
unto
the
beast:
and
they
worshipped
the
beast,
saying,
Who
is
like
unto
the
beast?
who
is
able
to
make
war
with
him?
013:005
And
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies;
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and
two
months.
013:006
And
he
opened
his
mouth
in
blasphemy
against
God,
to
blaspheme
his
name,
and
his
tabernacle,
and
them
that
dwell
in
heaven.
013:007
And
it
was
given
unto
him
to
make
war
with
the
saints,
and
to
overcome
them:
and
power
was
given
him
over
all
kindreds,
and
tongues,
and
nations.
013:008
And
all
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
worship
him,
whose
names
are
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
of
the
Lamb
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
world.
013:009
If
any
man
have
an
ear,
let
him
hear.
013:010
He
that
leadeth
into
captivity
shall
go
into
captivity:
he
that
killeth
with
the
sword
must
be
killed
with
the
sword.
Here
is
the
patience
and
the
faith
of
the
saints.
013:011
And
I
beheld
another
beast
coming
up
out
of
the
earth;
and
he
had
two
horns
like
a
lamb,
and
he
spake
as
a
dragon.
013:012
And
he
exerciseth
all
the
power
of
the
first
beast
before
him,
and
causeth
the
earth
and
them
which
dwell
therein
to
worship
the
first
beast,
whose
deadly
wound
was
healed.
013:013
And
he
doeth
great
wonders,
so
that
he
maketh
fire
come
down
from
heaven
on
the
earth
in
the
sight
of
men,
013:014
And
deceiveth
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
by
the
means
of
those
miracles
which
he
had
power
to
do
in
the
sight
of
the
beast;
saying
to
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth,
that
they
should
make
an
image
to
the
beast,
which
had
the
wound
by
a
sword,
and
did
live.
013:015
And
he
had
power
to
give
life
unto
the
image
of
the
beast,
that
the
image
of
the
beast
should
both
speak,
and
cause
that
as
many
as
would
not
worship
the
image
of
the
beast
should
be
killed.
013:016
And
he
causeth
all,
both
small
and
great,
rich
and
poor,
free
and
bond,
to
receive
a
mark
in
their
right
hand,
or
in
their
foreheads:
013:017
And
that
no
man
might
buy
or
sell,
save
he
that
had
the
mark,
or
the
name
of
the
beast,
or
the
number
of
his
name.
013:018
Here
is
wisdom.
Let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
of
the
beast:
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
man;
and
his
number
is
Six
hundred
threescore
and
six.
014:001
And
I
looked,
and,
lo,
a
Lamb
stood
on
the
mount
Sion,
and
with
him
an
hundred
forty
and
four
thousand,
having
his
Father's
name
written
in
their
foreheads.
014:002
And
I
heard
a
voice
from
heaven,
as
the
voice
of
many
waters,
and
as
the
voice
of
a
great
thunder:
and
I
heard
the
voice
of
harpers
harping
with
their
harps:
014:003
And
they
sung
as
it
were
a
new
song
before
the
throne,
and
before
the
four
beasts,
and
the
elders:
and
no
man
could
learn
that
song
but
the
hundred
and
forty
and
four
thousand,
which
were
redeemed
from
the
earth.
014:004
These
are
they
which
were
not
defiled
with
women;
for
they
are
virgins.
These
are
they
which
follow
the
Lamb
whithersoever
he
goeth.
These
were
redeemed
from
among
men,
being
the
firstfruits
unto
God
and
to
the
Lamb.
014:005
And
in
their
mouth
was
found
no
guile:
for
they
are
without
fault
before
the
throne
of
God.
014:006
And
I
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven,
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth,
and
to
every
nation,
and
kindred,
and
tongue,
and
people,
014:007
Saying
with
a
loud
voice,
Fear
God,
and
give
glory
to
him;
for
the
hour
of
his
judgment
is
come:
and
worship
him
that
made
heaven,
and
earth,
and
the
sea,
and
the
fountains
of
waters.
014:008
And
there
followed
another
angel,
saying,
Babylon
is
fallen,
is
fallen,
that
great
city,
because
she
made
all
nations
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
fornication.
014:009
And
the
third
angel
followed
them,
saying
with
a
loud
voice,
If
any
man
worship
the
beast
and
his
image,
and
receive
his
mark
in
his
forehead,
or
in
his
hand,
014:010
The
same
shall
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
God,
which
is
poured
out
without
mixture
into
the
cup
of
his
indignation;
and
he
shall
be
tormented
with
fire
and
brimstone
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
angels,
and
in
the
presence
of
the
Lamb:
014:011
And
the
smoke
of
their
torment
ascendeth
up
for
ever
and
ever:
and
they
have
no
rest
day
nor
night,
who
worship
the
beast
and
his
image,
and
whosoever
receiveth
the
mark
of
his
name.
014:012
Here
is
the
patience
of
the
saints:
here
are
they
that
keep
the
commandments
of
God,
and
the
faith
of
Jesus.
014:013
And
I
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me,
Write,
Blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
Lord
from
henceforth:
Yea,
saith
the
Spirit,
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labours;
and
their
works
do
follow
them.
014:014
And
I
looked,
and
behold
a
white
cloud,
and
upon
the
cloud
one
sat
like
unto
the
Son
of
man,
having
on
his
head
a
golden
crown,
and
in
his
hand
a
sharp
sickle.
014:015
And
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple,
crying
with
a
loud
voice
to
him
that
sat
on
the
cloud,
Thrust
in
thy
sickle,
and
reap:
for
the
time
is
come
for
thee
to
reap;
for
the
harvest
of
the
earth
is
ripe.
014:016
And
he
that
sat
on
the
cloud
thrust
in
his
sickle
on
the
earth;
and
the
earth
was
reaped.
014:017
And
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple
which
is
in
heaven,
he
also
having
a
sharp
sickle.
014:018
And
another
angel
came
out
from
the
altar,
which
had
power
over
fire;
and
cried
with
a
loud
cry
to
him
that
had
the
sharp
sickle,
saying,
Thrust
in
thy
sharp
sickle,
and
gather
the
clusters
of
the
vine
of
the
earth;
for
her
grapes
are
fully
ripe.
014:019
And
the
angel
thrust
in
his
sickle
into
the
earth,
and
gathered
the
vine
of
the
earth,
and
cast
it
into
the
great
winepress
of
the
wrath
of
God.
014:020
And
the
winepress
was
trodden
without
the
city,
and
blood
came
out
of
the
winepress,
even
unto
the
horse
bridles,
by
the
space
of
a
thousand
and
six
hundred
furlongs.
015:001
And
I
saw
another
sign
in
heaven,
great
and
marvellous,
seven
angels
having
the
seven
last
plagues;
for
in
them
is
filled
up
the
wrath
of
God.
015:002
And
I
saw
as
it
were
a
sea
of
glass
mingled
with
fire:
and
them
that
had
gotten
the
victory
over
the
beast,
and
over
his
image,
and
over
his
mark,
and
over
the
number
of
his
name,
stand
on
the
sea
of
glass,
having
the
harps
of
God.
015:003
And
they
sing
the
song
of
Moses
the
servant
of
God,
and
the
song
of
the
Lamb,
saying,
Great
and
marvellous
are
thy
works,
Lord
God
Almighty;
just
and
true
are
thy
ways,
thou
King
of
saints.
015:004
Who
shall
not
fear
thee,
O
Lord,
and
glorify
thy
name?
for
thou
only
art
holy:
for
all
nations
shall
come
and
worship
before
thee;
for
thy
judgments
are
made
manifest.
015:005
And
after
that
I
looked,
and,
behold,
the
temple
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
testimony
in
heaven
was
opened:
015:006
And
the
seven
angels
came
out
of
the
temple,
having
the
seven
plagues,
clothed
in
pure
and
white
linen,
and
having
their
breasts
girded
with
golden
girdles.
015:007
And
one
of
the
four
beasts
gave
unto
the
seven
angels
seven
golden
vials
full
of
the
wrath
of
God,
who
liveth
for
ever
and
ever.
015:008
And
the
temple
was
filled
with
smoke
from
the
glory
of
God,
and
from
his
power;
and
no
man
was
able
to
enter
into
the
temple,
till
the
seven
plagues
of
the
seven
angels
were
fulfilled.
016:001
And
I
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
saying
to
the
seven
angels,
Go
your
ways,
and
pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
the
earth.
016:002
And
the
first
went,
and
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
earth;
and
there
fell
a
noisome
and
grievous
sore
upon
the
men
which
had
the
mark
of
the
beast,
and
upon
them
which
worshipped
his
image.
016:003
And
the
second
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
sea;
and
it
became
as
the
blood
of
a
dead
man:
and
every
living
soul
died
in
the
sea.
016:004
And
the
third
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
rivers
and
fountains
of
waters;
and
they
became
blood.
016:005
And
I
heard
the
angel
of
the
waters
say,
Thou
art
righteous,
O
Lord,
which
art,
and
wast,
and
shalt
be,
because
thou
hast
judged
thus.
016:006
For
they
have
shed
the
blood
of
saints
and
prophets,
and
thou
hast
given
them
blood
to
drink;
for
they
are
worthy.
016:007
And
I
heard
another
out
of
the
altar
say,
Even
so,
Lord
God
Almighty,
true
and
righteous
are
thy
judgments.
016:008
And
the
fourth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
sun;
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
scorch
men
with
fire.
016:009
And
men
were
scorched
with
great
heat,
and
blasphemed
the
name
of
God,
which
hath
power
over
these
plagues:
and
they
repented
not
to
give
him
glory.
016:010
And
the
fifth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
seat
of
the
beast;
and
his
kingdom
was
full
of
darkness;
and
they
gnawed
their
tongues
for
pain,
016:011
And
blasphemed
the
God
of
heaven
because
of
their
pains
and
their
sores,
and
repented
not
of
their
deeds.
016:012
And
the
sixth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
great
river
Euphrates;
and
the
water
thereof
was
dried
up,
that
the
way
of
the
kings
of
the
east
might
be
prepared.
016:013
And
I
saw
three
unclean
spirits
like
frogs
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
dragon,
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
beast,
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
false
prophet.
016:014
For
they
are
the
spirits
of
devils,
working
miracles,
which
go
forth
unto
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
of
the
whole
world,
to
gather
them
to
the
battle
of
that
great
day
of
God
Almighty.
016:015
Behold,
I
come
as
a
thief.
Blessed
is
he
that
watcheth,
and
keepeth
his
garments,
lest
he
walk
naked,
and
they
see
his
shame.
016:016
And
he
gathered
them
together
into
a
place
called
in
the
Hebrew
tongue
Armageddon.
016:017
And
the
seventh
angel
poured
out
his
vial
into
the
air;
and
there
came
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
of
heaven,
from
the
throne,
saying,
It
is
done.
016:018
And
there
were
voices,
and
thunders,
and
lightnings;
and
there
was
a
great
earthquake,
such
as
was
not
since
men
were
upon
the
earth,
so
mighty
an
earthquake,
and
so
great.
016:019
And
the
great
city
was
divided
into
three
parts,
and
the
cities
of
the
nations
fell:
and
great
Babylon
came
in
remembrance
before
God,
to
give
unto
her
the
cup
of
the
wine
of
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath.
016:020
And
every
island
fled
away,
and
the
mountains
were
not
found.
016:021
And
there
fell
upon
men
a
great
hail
out
of
heaven,
every
stone
about
the
weight
of
a
talent:
and
men
blasphemed
God
because
of
the
plague
of
the
hail;
for
the
plague
thereof
was
exceeding
great.
017:001
And
there
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
vials,
and
talked
with
me,
saying
unto
me,
Come
hither;
I
will
shew
unto
thee
the
judgment
of
the
great
whore
that
sitteth
upon
many
waters:
017:002
With
whom
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication,
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
have
been
made
drunk
with
the
wine
of
her
fornication.
017:003
So
he
carried
me
away
in
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness:
and
I
saw
a
woman
sit
upon
a
scarlet
coloured
beast,
full
of
names
of
blasphemy,
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns.
017:004
And
the
woman
was
arrayed
in
purple
and
scarlet
colour,
and
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls,
having
a
golden
cup
in
her
hand
full
of
abominations
and
filthiness
of
her
fornication:
017:005
And
upon
her
forehead
was
a
name
written,
MYSTERY,
BABYLON
THE
GREAT,
THE
MOTHER
OF
HARLOTS
AND
ABOMINATIONS
OF
THE
EARTH.
017:006
And
I
saw
the
woman
drunken
with
the
blood
of
the
saints,
and
with
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
of
Jesus:
and
when
I
saw
her,
I
wondered
with
great
admiration.
017:007
And
the
angel
said
unto
me,
Wherefore
didst
thou
marvel?
I
will
tell
thee
the
mystery
of
the
woman,
and
of
the
beast
that
carrieth
her,
which
hath
the
seven
heads
and
ten
horns.
017:008
The
beast
that
thou
sawest
was,
and
is
not;
and
shall
ascend
out
of
the
bottomless
pit,
and
go
into
perdition:
and
they
that
dwell
on
the
earth
shall
wonder,
whose
names
were
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
from
the
foundation
of
the
world,
when
they
behold
the
beast
that
was,
and
is
not,
and
yet
is.
017:009
And
here
is
the
mind
which
hath
wisdom.
The
seven
heads
are
seven
mountains,
on
which
the
woman
sitteth.
017:010
And
there
are
seven
kings:
five
are
fallen,
and
one
is,
and
the
other
is
not
yet
come;
and
when
he
cometh,
he
must
continue
a
short
space.
017:011
And
the
beast
that
was,
and
is
not,
even
he
is
the
eighth,
and
is
of
the
seven,
and
goeth
into
perdition.
017:012
And
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
are
ten
kings,
which
have
received
no
kingdom
as
yet;
but
receive
power
as
kings
one
hour
with
the
beast.
017:013
These
have
one
mind,
and
shall
give
their
power
and
strength
unto
the
beast.
017:014
These
shall
make
war
with
the
Lamb,
and
the
Lamb
shall
overcome
them:
for
he
is
Lord
of
lords,
and
King
of
kings:
and
they
that
are
with
him
are
called,
and
chosen,
and
faithful.
017:015
And
he
saith
unto
me,
The
waters
which
thou
sawest,
where
the
whore
sitteth,
are
peoples,
and
multitudes,
and
nations,
and
tongues.
017:016
And
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
upon
the
beast,
these
shall
hate
the
whore,
and
shall
make
her
desolate
and
naked,
and
shall
eat
her
flesh,
and
burn
her
with
fire.
017:017
For
God
hath
put
in
their
hearts
to
fulfil
his
will,
and
to
agree,
and
give
their
kingdom
unto
the
beast,
until
the
words
of
God
shall
be
fulfilled.
017:018
And
the
woman
which
thou
sawest
is
that
great
city,
which
reigneth
over
the
kings
of
the
earth.
018:001
And
after
these
things
I
saw
another
angel
come
down
from
heaven,
having
great
power;
and
the
earth
was
lightened
with
his
glory.
018:002
And
he
cried
mightily
with
a
strong
voice,
saying,
Babylon
the
great
is
fallen,
is
fallen,
and
is
become
the
habitation
of
devils,
and
the
hold
of
every
foul
spirit,
and
a
cage
of
every
unclean
and
hateful
bird.
018:003
For
all
nations
have
drunk
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
fornication,
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication
with
her,
and
the
merchants
of
the
earth
are
waxed
rich
through
the
abundance
of
her
delicacies.
018:004
And
I
heard
another
voice
from
heaven,
saying,
Come
out
of
her,
my
people,
that
ye
be
not
partakers
of
her
sins,
and
that
ye
receive
not
of
her
plagues.
018:005
For
her
sins
have
reached
unto
heaven,
and
God
hath
remembered
her
iniquities.
018:006
Reward
her
even
as
she
rewarded
you,
and
double
unto
her
double
according
to
her
works:
in
the
cup
which
she
hath
filled
fill
to
her
double.
018:007
How
much
she
hath
glorified
herself,
and
lived
deliciously,
so
much
torment
and
sorrow
give
her:
for
she
saith
in
her
heart,
I
sit
a
queen,
and
am
no
widow,
and
shall
see
no
sorrow.
018:008
Therefore
shall
her
plagues
come
in
one
day,
death,
and
mourning,
and
famine;
and
she
shall
be
utterly
burned
with
fire:
for
strong
is
the
Lord
God
who
judgeth
her.
018:009
And
the
kings
of
the
earth,
who
have
committed
fornication
and
lived
deliciously
with
her,
shall
bewail
her,
and
lament
for
her,
when
they
shall
see
the
smoke
of
her
burning,
018:010
Standing
afar
off
for
the
fear
of
her
torment,
saying,
Alas,
alas
that
great
city
Babylon,
that
mighty
city!
for
in
one
hour
is
thy
judgment
come.
018:011
And
the
merchants
of
the
earth
shall
weep
and
mourn
over
her;
for
no
man
buyeth
their
merchandise
any
more:
018:012
The
merchandise
of
gold,
and
silver,
and
precious
stones,
and
of
pearls,
and
fine
linen,
and
purple,
and
silk,
and
scarlet,
and
all
thyine
wood,
and
all
manner
vessels
of
ivory,
and
all
manner
vessels
of
most
precious
wood,
and
of
brass,
and
iron,
and
marble,
018:013
And
cinnamon,
and
odours,
and
ointments,
and
frankincense,
and
wine,
and
oil,
and
fine
flour,
and
wheat,
and
beasts,
and
sheep,
and
horses,
and
chariots,
and
slaves,
and
souls
of
men.
018:014
And
the
fruits
that
thy
soul
lusted
after
are
departed
from
thee,
and
all
things
which
were
dainty
and
goodly
are
departed
from
thee,
and
thou
shalt
find
them
no
more
at
all.
018:015
The
merchants
of
these
things,
which
were
made
rich
by
her,
shall
stand
afar
off
for
the
fear
of
her
torment,
weeping
and
wailing,
018:016
And
saying,
Alas,
alas
that
great
city,
that
was
clothed
in
fine
linen,
and
purple,
and
scarlet,
and
decked
with
gold,
and
precious
stones,
and
pearls!
018:017
For
in
one
hour
so
great
riches
is
come
to
nought.
And
every
shipmaster,
and
all
the
company
in
ships,
and
sailors,
and
as
many
as
trade
by
sea,
stood
afar
off,
018:018
And
cried
when
they
saw
the
smoke
of
her
burning,
saying,
What
city
is
like
unto
this
great
city!
018:019
And
they
cast
dust
on
their
heads,
and
cried,
weeping
and
wailing,
saying,
Alas,
alas
that
great
city,
wherein
were
made
rich
all
that
had
ships
in
the
sea
by
reason
of
her
costliness!
for
in
one
hour
is
she
made
desolate.
018:020
Rejoice
over
her,
thou
heaven,
and
ye
holy
apostles
and
prophets;
for
God
hath
avenged
you
on
her.
018:021
And
a
mighty
angel
took
up
a
stone
like
a
great
millstone,
and
cast
it
into
the
sea,
saying,
Thus
with
violence
shall
that
great
city
Babylon
be
thrown
down,
and
shall
be
found
no
more
at
all.
018:022
And
the
voice
of
harpers,
and
musicians,
and
of
pipers,
and
trumpeters,
shall
be
heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee;
and
no
craftsman,
of
whatsoever
craft
he
be,
shall
be
found
any
more
in
thee;
and
the
sound
of
a
millstone
shall
be
heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee;
018:023
And
the
light
of
a
candle
shall
shine
no
more
at
all
in
thee;
and
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
of
the
bride
shall
be
heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee:
for
thy
merchants
were
the
great
men
of
the
earth;
for
by
thy
sorceries
were
all
nations
deceived.
018:024
And
in
her
was
found
the
blood
of
prophets,
and
of
saints,
and
of
all
that
were
slain
upon
the
earth.
019:001
And
after
these
things
I
heard
a
great
voice
of
much
people
in
heaven,
saying,
Alleluia;
Salvation,
and
glory,
and
honour,
and
power,
unto
the
Lord
our
God:
019:002
For
true
and
righteous
are
his
judgments:
for
he
hath
judged
the
great
whore,
which
did
corrupt
the
earth
with
her
fornication,
and
hath
avenged
the
blood
of
his
servants
at
her
hand.
019:003
And
again
they
said,
Alleluia
And
her
smoke
rose
up
for
ever
and
ever.
019:004
And
the
four
and
twenty
elders
and
the
four
beasts
fell
down
and
worshipped
God
that
sat
on
the
throne,
saying,
Amen;
Alleluia.
019:005
And
a
voice
came
out
of
the
throne,
saying,
Praise
our
God,
all
ye
his
servants,
and
ye
that
fear
him,
both
small
and
great.
019:006
And
I
heard
as
it
were
the
voice
of
a
great
multitude,
and
as
the
voice
of
many
waters,
and
as
the
voice
of
mighty
thunderings,
saying,
Alleluia:
for
the
Lord
God
omnipotent
reigneth.
019:007
Let
us
be
glad
and
rejoice,
and
give
honour
to
him:
for
the
marriage
of
the
Lamb
is
come,
and
his
wife
hath
made
herself
ready.
019:008
And
to
her
was
granted
that
she
should
be
arrayed
in
fine
linen,
clean
and
white:
for
the
fine
linen
is
the
righteousness
of
saints.
019:009
And
he
saith
unto
me,
Write,
Blessed
are
they
which
are
called
unto
the
marriage
supper
of
the
Lamb.
And
he
saith
unto
me,
These
are
the
true
sayings
of
God.
019:010
And
I
fell
at
his
feet
to
worship
him.
And
he
said
unto
me,
See
thou
do
it
not:
I
am
thy
fellowservant,
and
of
thy
brethren
that
have
the
testimony
of
Jesus:
worship
God:
for
the
testimony
of
Jesus
is
the
spirit
of
prophecy.
019:011
And
I
saw
heaven
opened,
and
behold
a
white
horse;
and
he
that
sat
upon
him
was
called
Faithful
and
True,
and
in
righteousness
he
doth
judge
and
make
war.
019:012
His
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire,
and
on
his
head
were
many
crowns;
and
he
had
a
name
written,
that
no
man
knew,
but
he
himself.
019:013
And
he
was
clothed
with
a
vesture
dipped
in
blood:
and
his
name
is
called
The
Word
of
God.
019:014
And
the
armies
which
were
in
heaven
followed
him
upon
white
horses,
clothed
in
fine
linen,
white
and
clean.
019:015
And
out
of
his
mouth
goeth
a
sharp
sword,
that
with
it
he
should
smite
the
nations:
and
he
shall
rule
them
with
a
rod
of
iron:
and
he
treadeth
the
winepress
of
the
fierceness
and
wrath
of
Almighty
God.
019:016
And
he
hath
on
his
vesture
and
on
his
thigh
a
name
written,
KING
OF
KINGS,
AND
LORD
OF
LORDS.
019:017
And
I
saw
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun;
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
saying
to
all
the
fowls
that
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven,
Come
and
gather
yourselves
together
unto
the
supper
of
the
great
God;
019:018
That
ye
may
eat
the
flesh
of
kings,
and
the
flesh
of
captains,
and
the
flesh
of
mighty
men,
and
the
flesh
of
horses,
and
of
them
that
sit
on
them,
and
the
flesh
of
all
men,
both
free
and
bond,
both
small
and
great.
019:019
And
I
saw
the
beast,
and
the
kings
of
the
earth,
and
their
armies,
gathered
together
to
make
war
against
him
that
sat
on
the
horse,
and
against
his
army.
019:020
And
the
beast
was
taken,
and
with
him
the
false
prophet
that
wrought
miracles
before
him,
with
which
he
deceived
them
that
had
received
the
mark
of
the
beast,
and
them
that
worshipped
his
image.
These
both
were
cast
alive
into
a
lake
of
fire
burning
with
brimstone.
019:021
And
the
remnant
were
slain
with
the
sword
of
him
that
