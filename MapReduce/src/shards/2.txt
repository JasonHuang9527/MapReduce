thou
art
northward,
and
southward,
and
eastward,
and
westward:
013:015
For
all
the
land
which
thou
seest,
to
thee
will
I
give
it,
and
to
thy
seed
for
ever.
013:016
And
I
will
make
thy
seed
as
the
dust
of
the
earth:
so
that
if
a
man
can
number
the
dust
of
the
earth,
then
shall
thy
seed
also
be
numbered.
013:017
Arise,
walk
through
the
land
in
the
length
of
it
and
in
the
breadth
of
it;
for
I
will
give
it
unto
thee.
013:018
Then
Abram
removed
his
tent,
and
came
and
dwelt
in
the
plain
of
Mamre,
which
is
in
Hebron,
and
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
LORD.
014:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Amraphel
king
of
Shinar,
Arioch
king
of
Ellasar,
Chedorlaomer
king
of
Elam,
and
Tidal
king
of
nations;
014:002
That
these
made
war
with
Bera
king
of
Sodom,
and
with
Birsha
king
of
Gomorrah,
Shinab
king
of
Admah,
and
Shemeber
king
of
Zeboiim,
and
the
king
of
Bela,
which
is
Zoar.
014:003
All
these
were
joined
together
in
the
vale
of
Siddim,
which
is
the
salt
sea.
014:004
Twelve
years
they
served
Chedorlaomer,
and
in
the
thirteenth
year
they
rebelled.
014:005
And
in
the
fourteenth
year
came
Chedorlaomer,
and
the
kings
that
were
with
him,
and
smote
the
Rephaims
in
Ashteroth
Karnaim,
and
the
Zuzims
in
Ham,
and
the
Emins
in
Shaveh
Kiriathaim,
014:006
And
the
Horites
in
their
mount
Seir,
unto
Elparan,
which
is
by
the
wilderness.
014:007
And
they
returned,
and
came
to
Enmishpat,
which
is
Kadesh,
and
smote
all
the
country
of
the
Amalekites,
and
also
the
Amorites,
that
dwelt
in
Hazezontamar.
014:008
And
there
went
out
the
king
of
Sodom,
and
the
king
of
Gomorrah,
and
the
king
of
Admah,
and
the
king
of
Zeboiim,
and
the
king
of
Bela
(the
same
is
Zoar;)
and
they
joined
battle
with
them
in
the
vale
of
Siddim;
014:009
With
Chedorlaomer
the
king
of
Elam,
and
with
Tidal
king
of
nations,
and
Amraphel
king
of
Shinar,
and
Arioch
king
of
Ellasar;
four
kings
with
five.
014:010
And
the
vale
of
Siddim
was
full
of
slimepits;
and
the
kings
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
fled,
and
fell
there;
and
they
that
remained
fled
to
the
mountain.
014:011
And
they
took
all
the
goods
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah,
and
all
their
victuals,
and
went
their
way.
014:012
And
they
took
Lot,
Abram's
brother's
son,
who
dwelt
in
Sodom,
and
his
goods,
and
departed.
014:013
And
there
came
one
that
had
escaped,
and
told
Abram
the
Hebrew;
for
he
dwelt
in
the
plain
of
Mamre
the
Amorite,
brother
of
Eshcol,
and
brother
of
Aner:
and
these
were
confederate
with
Abram.
014:014
And
when
Abram
heard
that
his
brother
was
taken
captive,
he
armed
his
trained
servants,
born
in
his
own
house,
three
hundred
and
eighteen,
and
pursued
them
unto
Dan.
014:015
And
he
divided
himself
against
them,
he
and
his
servants,
by
night,
and
smote
them,
and
pursued
them
unto
Hobah,
which
is
on
the
left
hand
of
Damascus.
014:016
And
he
brought
back
all
the
goods,
and
also
brought
again
his
brother
Lot,
and
his
goods,
and
the
women
also,
and
the
people.
014:017
And
the
king
of
Sodom
went
out
to
meet
him
after
his
return
from
the
slaughter
of
Chedorlaomer,
and
of
the
kings
that
were
with
him,
at
the
valley
of
Shaveh,
which
is
the
king's
dale.
014:018
And
Melchizedek
king
of
Salem
brought
forth
bread
and
wine:
and
he
was
the
priest
of
the
most
high
God.
014:019
And
he
blessed
him,
and
said,
Blessed
be
Abram
of
the
most
high
God,
possessor
of
heaven
and
earth:
014:020
And
blessed
be
the
most
high
God,
which
hath
delivered
thine
enemies
into
thy
hand.
And
he
gave
him
tithes
of
all.
014:021
And
the
king
of
Sodom
said
unto
Abram,
Give
me
the
persons,
and
take
the
goods
to
thyself.
014:022
And
Abram
said
to
the
king
of
Sodom,
I
have
lift
up
mine
hand
unto
the
LORD,
the
most
high
God,
the
possessor
of
heaven
and
earth,
014:023
That
I
will
not
take
from
a
thread
even
to
a
shoelatchet,
and
that
I
will
not
take
any
thing
that
is
thine,
lest
thou
shouldest
say,
I
have
made
Abram
rich:
014:024
Save
only
that
which
the
young
men
have
eaten,
and
the
portion
of
the
men
which
went
with
me,
Aner,
Eshcol,
and
Mamre;
let
them
take
their
portion.
015:001
After
these
things
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Abram
in
a
vision,
saying,
Fear
not,
Abram:
I
am
thy
shield,
and
thy
exceeding
great
reward.
015:002
And
Abram
said,
LORD
God,
what
wilt
thou
give
me,
seeing
I
go
childless,
and
the
steward
of
my
house
is
this
Eliezer
of
Damascus?
015:003
And
Abram
said,
Behold,
to
me
thou
hast
given
no
seed:
and,
lo,
one
born
in
my
house
is
mine
heir.
015:004
And,
behold,
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
him,
saying,
This
shall
not
be
thine
heir;
but
he
that
shall
come
forth
out
of
thine
own
bowels
shall
be
thine
heir.
015:005
And
he
brought
him
forth
abroad,
and
said,
Look
now
toward
heaven,
and
tell
the
stars,
if
thou
be
able
to
number
them:
and
he
said
unto
him,
So
shall
thy
seed
be.
015:006
And
he
believed
in
the
LORD;
and
he
counted
it
to
him
for
righteousness.
015:007
And
he
said
unto
him,
I
am
the
LORD
that
brought
thee
out
of
Ur
of
the
Chaldees,
to
give
thee
this
land
to
inherit
it.
015:008
And
he
said,
LORD
God,
whereby
shall
I
know
that
I
shall
inherit
it?
015:009
And
he
said
unto
him,
Take
me
an
heifer
of
three
years
old,
and
a
she
goat
of
three
years
old,
and
a
ram
of
three
years
old,
and
a
turtledove,
and
a
young
pigeon.
015:010
And
he
took
unto
him
all
these,
and
divided
them
in
the
midst,
and
laid
each
piece
one
against
another:
but
the
birds
divided
he
not.
015:011
And
when
the
fowls
came
down
upon
the
carcases,
Abram
drove
them
away.
015:012
And
when
the
sun
was
going
down,
a
deep
sleep
fell
upon
Abram;
and,
lo,
an
horror
of
great
darkness
fell
upon
him.
015:013
And
he
said
unto
Abram,
Know
of
a
surety
that
thy
seed
shall
be
a
stranger
in
a
land
that
is
not
their's,
and
shall
serve
them;
and
they
shall
afflict
them
four
hundred
years;
015:014
And
also
that
nation,
whom
they
shall
serve,
will
I
judge:
and
afterward
shall
they
come
out
with
great
substance.
015:015
And
thou
shalt
go
to
thy
fathers
in
peace;
thou
shalt
be
buried
in
a
good
old
age.
015:016
But
in
the
fourth
generation
they
shall
come
hither
again:
for
the
iniquity
of
the
Amorites
is
not
yet
full.
015:017
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
the
sun
went
down,
and
it
was
dark,
behold
a
smoking
furnace,
and
a
burning
lamp
that
passed
between
those
pieces.
015:018
In
the
same
day
the
LORD
made
a
covenant
with
Abram,
saying,
Unto
thy
seed
have
I
given
this
land,
from
the
river
of
Egypt
unto
the
great
river,
the
river
Euphrates:
015:019
The
Kenites,
and
the
Kenizzites,
and
the
Kadmonites,
015:020
And
the
Hittites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Rephaims,
015:021
And
the
Amorites,
and
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Girgashites,
and
the
Jebusites.
016:001
Now
Sarai
Abram's
wife
bare
him
no
children:
and
she
had
an
handmaid,
an
Egyptian,
whose
name
was
Hagar.
016:002
And
Sarai
said
unto
Abram,
Behold
now,
the
LORD
hath
restrained
me
from
bearing:
I
pray
thee,
go
in
unto
my
maid;
it
may
be
that
I
may
obtain
children
by
her.
And
Abram
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
Sarai.
016:003
And
Sarai
Abram's
wife
took
Hagar
her
maid
the
Egyptian,
after
Abram
had
dwelt
ten
years
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
gave
her
to
her
husband
Abram
to
be
his
wife.
016:004
And
he
went
in
unto
Hagar,
and
she
conceived:
and
when
she
saw
that
she
had
conceived,
her
mistress
was
despised
in
her
eyes.
016:005
And
Sarai
said
unto
Abram,
My
wrong
be
upon
thee:
I
have
given
my
maid
into
thy
bosom;
and
when
she
saw
that
she
had
conceived,
I
was
despised
in
her
eyes:
the
LORD
judge
between
me
and
thee.
016:006
But
Abram
said
unto
Sarai,
Behold,
thy
maid
is
in
thine
hand;
do
to
her
as
it
pleaseth
thee.
And
when
Sarai
dealt
hardly
with
her,
she
fled
from
her
face.
016:007
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
found
her
by
a
fountain
of
water
in
the
wilderness,
by
the
fountain
in
the
way
to
Shur.
016:008
And
he
said,
Hagar,
Sarai's
maid,
whence
camest
thou?
and
whither
wilt
thou
go?
And
she
said,
I
flee
from
the
face
of
my
mistress
Sarai.
016:009
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
her,
Return
to
thy
mistress,
and
submit
thyself
under
her
hands.
016:010
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
her,
I
will
multiply
thy
seed
exceedingly,
that
it
shall
not
be
numbered
for
multitude.
016:011
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
her,
Behold,
thou
art
with
child
and
shalt
bear
a
son,
and
shalt
call
his
name
Ishmael;
because
the
LORD
hath
heard
thy
affliction.
016:012
And
he
will
be
a
wild
man;
his
hand
will
be
against
every
man,
and
every
man's
hand
against
him;
and
he
shall
dwell
in
the
presence
of
all
his
brethren.
016:013
And
she
called
the
name
of
the
LORD
that
spake
unto
her,
Thou
God
seest
me:
for
she
said,
Have
I
also
here
looked
after
him
that
seeth
me?
016:014
Wherefore
the
well
was
called
Beerlahairoi;
behold,
it
is
between
Kadesh
and
Bered.
016:015
And
Hagar
bare
Abram
a
son:
and
Abram
called
his
son's
name,
which
Hagar
bare,
Ishmael.
016:016
And
Abram
was
fourscore
and
six
years
old,
when
Hagar
bare
Ishmael
to
Abram.
017:001
And
when
Abram
was
ninety
years
old
and
nine,
the
LORD
appeared
to
Abram,
and
said
unto
him,
I
am
the
Almighty
God;
walk
before
me,
and
be
thou
perfect.
017:002
And
I
will
make
my
covenant
between
me
and
thee,
and
will
multiply
thee
exceedingly.
017:003
And
Abram
fell
on
his
face:
and
God
talked
with
him,
saying,
017:004
As
for
me,
behold,
my
covenant
is
with
thee,
and
thou
shalt
be
a
father
of
many
nations.
017:005
Neither
shall
thy
name
any
more
be
called
Abram,
but
thy
name
shall
be
Abraham;
for
a
father
of
many
nations
have
I
made
thee.
017:006
And
I
will
make
thee
exceeding
fruitful,
and
I
will
make
nations
of
thee,
and
kings
shall
come
out
of
thee.
017:007
And
I
will
establish
my
covenant
between
me
and
thee
and
thy
seed
after
thee
in
their
generations
for
an
everlasting
covenant,
to
be
a
God
unto
thee,
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee.
017:008
And
I
will
give
unto
thee,
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee,
the
land
wherein
thou
art
a
stranger,
all
the
land
of
Canaan,
for
an
everlasting
possession;
and
I
will
be
their
God.
017:009
And
God
said
unto
Abraham,
Thou
shalt
keep
my
covenant
therefore,
thou,
and
thy
seed
after
thee
in
their
generations.
017:010
This
is
my
covenant,
which
ye
shall
keep,
between
me
and
you
and
thy
seed
after
thee;
Every
man
child
among
you
shall
be
circumcised.
017:011
And
ye
shall
circumcise
the
flesh
of
your
foreskin;
and
it
shall
be
a
token
of
the
covenant
betwixt
me
and
you.
017:012
And
he
that
is
eight
days
old
shall
be
circumcised
among
you,
every
man
child
in
your
generations,
he
that
is
born
in
the
house,
or
bought
with
money
of
any
stranger,
which
is
not
of
thy
seed.
017:013
He
that
is
born
in
thy
house,
and
he
that
is
bought
with
thy
money,
must
needs
be
circumcised:
and
my
covenant
shall
be
in
your
flesh
for
an
everlasting
covenant.
017:014
And
the
uncircumcised
man
child
whose
flesh
of
his
foreskin
is
not
circumcised,
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
people;
he
hath
broken
my
covenant.
017:015
And
God
said
unto
Abraham,
As
for
Sarai
thy
wife,
thou
shalt
not
call
her
name
Sarai,
but
Sarah
shall
her
name
be.
017:016
And
I
will
bless
her,
and
give
thee
a
son
also
of
her:
yea,
I
will
bless
her,
and
she
shall
be
a
mother
of
nations;
kings
of
people
shall
be
of
her.
017:017
Then
Abraham
fell
upon
his
face,
and
laughed,
and
said
in
his
heart,
Shall
a
child
be
born
unto
him
that
is
an
hundred
years
old?
and
shall
Sarah,
that
is
ninety
years
old,
bear?
017:018
And
Abraham
said
unto
God,
O
that
Ishmael
might
live
before
thee!
017:019
And
God
said,
Sarah
thy
wife
shall
bear
thee
a
son
indeed;
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
Isaac:
and
I
will
establish
my
covenant
with
him
for
an
everlasting
covenant,
and
with
his
seed
after
him.
017:020
And
as
for
Ishmael,
I
have
heard
thee:
Behold,
I
have
blessed
him,
and
will
make
him
fruitful,
and
will
multiply
him
exceedingly;
twelve
princes
shall
he
beget,
and
I
will
make
him
a
great
nation.
017:021
But
my
covenant
will
I
establish
with
Isaac,
which
Sarah
shall
bear
unto
thee
at
this
set
time
in
the
next
year.
017:022
And
he
left
off
talking
with
him,
and
God
went
up
from
Abraham.
017:023
And
Abraham
took
Ishmael
his
son,
and
all
that
were
born
in
his
house,
and
all
that
were
bought
with
his
money,
every
male
among
the
men
of
Abraham's
house;
and
circumcised
the
flesh
of
their
foreskin
in
the
selfsame
day,
as
God
had
said
unto
him.
017:024
And
Abraham
was
ninety
years
old
and
nine,
when
he
was
circumcised
in
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin.
017:025
And
Ishmael
his
son
was
thirteen
years
old,
when
he
was
circumcised
in
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin.
017:026
In
the
selfsame
day
was
Abraham
circumcised,
and
Ishmael
his
son.
017:027
And
all
the
men
of
his
house,
born
in
the
house,
and
bought
with
money
of
the
stranger,
were
circumcised
with
him.
018:001
And
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him
in
the
plains
of
Mamre:
and
he
sat
in
the
tent
door
in
the
heat
of
the
day;
018:002
And
he
lift
up
his
eyes
and
looked,
and,
lo,
three
men
stood
by
him:
and
when
he
saw
them,
he
ran
to
meet
them
from
the
tent
door,
and
bowed
himself
toward
the
ground,
018:003
And
said,
My
LORD,
if
now
I
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight,
pass
not
away,
I
pray
thee,
from
thy
servant:
018:004
Let
a
little
water,
I
pray
you,
be
fetched,
and
wash
your
feet,
and
rest
yourselves
under
the
tree:
018:005
And
I
will
fetch
a
morsel
of
bread,
and
comfort
ye
your
hearts;
after
that
ye
shall
pass
on:
for
therefore
are
ye
come
to
your
servant.
And
they
said,
So
do,
as
thou
hast
said.
018:006
And
Abraham
hastened
into
the
tent
unto
Sarah,
and
said,
Make
ready
quickly
three
measures
of
fine
meal,
knead
it,
and
make
cakes
upon
the
hearth.
018:007
And
Abraham
ran
unto
the
herd,
and
fetcht
a
calf
tender
and
good,
and
gave
it
unto
a
young
man;
and
he
hasted
to
dress
it.
018:008
And
he
took
butter,
and
milk,
and
the
calf
which
he
had
dressed,
and
set
it
before
them;
and
he
stood
by
them
under
the
tree,
and
they
did
eat.
018:009
And
they
said
unto
him,
Where
is
Sarah
thy
wife?
And
he
said,
Behold,
in
the
tent.
018:010
And
he
said,
I
will
certainly
return
unto
thee
according
to
the
time
of
life;
and,
lo,
Sarah
thy
wife
shall
have
a
son.
And
Sarah
heard
it
in
the
tent
door,
which
was
behind
him.
018:011
Now
Abraham
and
Sarah
were
old
and
well
stricken
in
age;
and
it
ceased
to
be
with
Sarah
after
the
manner
of
women.
018:012
Therefore
Sarah
laughed
within
herself,
saying,
After
I
am
waxed
old
shall
I
have
pleasure,
my
lord
being
old
also?
018:013
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Abraham,
Wherefore
did
Sarah
laugh,
saying,
Shall
I
of
a
surety
bear
a
child,
which
am
old?
018:014
Is
any
thing
too
hard
for
the
LORD?
At
the
time
appointed
I
will
return
unto
thee,
according
to
the
time
of
life,
and
Sarah
shall
have
a
son.
018:015
Then
Sarah
denied,
saying,
I
laughed
not;
for
she
was
afraid.
And
he
said,
Nay;
but
thou
didst
laugh.
018:016
And
the
men
rose
up
from
thence,
and
looked
toward
Sodom:
and
Abraham
went
with
them
to
bring
them
on
the
way.
018:017
And
the
LORD
said,
Shall
I
hide
from
Abraham
that
thing
which
I
do;
018:018
Seeing
that
Abraham
shall
surely
become
a
great
and
mighty
nation,
and
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
shall
be
blessed
in
him?
018:019
For
I
know
him,
that
he
will
command
his
children
and
his
household
after
him,
and
they
shall
keep
the
way
of
the
LORD,
to
do
justice
and
judgment;
that
the
LORD
may
bring
upon
Abraham
that
which
he
hath
spoken
of
him.
018:020
And
the
LORD
said,
Because
the
cry
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
is
great,
and
because
their
sin
is
very
grievous;
018:021
I
will
go
down
now,
and
see
whether
they
have
done
altogether
according
to
the
cry
of
it,
which
is
come
unto
me;
and
if
not,
I
will
know.
018:022
And
the
men
turned
their
faces
from
thence,
and
went
toward
Sodom:
but
Abraham
stood
yet
before
the
LORD.
018:023
And
Abraham
drew
near,
and
said,
Wilt
thou
also
destroy
the
righteous
with
the
wicked?
018:024
Peradventure
there
be
fifty
righteous
within
the
city:
wilt
thou
also
destroy
and
not
spare
the
place
for
the
fifty
righteous
that
are
therein?
018:025
That
be
far
from
thee
to
do
after
this
manner,
to
slay
the
righteous
with
the
wicked:
and
that
the
righteous
should
be
as
the
wicked,
that
be
far
from
thee:
Shall
not
the
Judge
of
all
the
earth
do
right?
018:026
And
the
LORD
said,
If
I
find
in
Sodom
fifty
righteous
within
the
city,
then
I
will
spare
all
the
place
for
their
sakes.
018:027
And
Abraham
answered
and
said,
Behold
now,
I
have
taken
upon
me
to
speak
unto
the
LORD,
which
am
but
dust
and
ashes:
018:028
Peradventure
there
shall
lack
five
of
the
fifty
righteous:
wilt
thou
destroy
all
the
city
for
lack
of
five?
And
he
said,
If
I
find
there
forty
and
five,
I
will
not
destroy
it.
018:029
And
he
spake
unto
him
yet
again,
and
said,
Peradventure
there
shall
be
forty
found
there.
And
he
said,
I
will
not
do
it
for
forty's
sake.
018:030
And
he
said
unto
him,
Oh
let
not
the
LORD
be
angry,
and
I
will
speak:
Peradventure
there
shall
thirty
be
found
there.
And
he
said,
I
will
not
do
it,
if
I
find
thirty
there.
018:031
And
he
said,
Behold
now,
I
have
taken
upon
me
to
speak
unto
the
LORD:
Peradventure
there
shall
be
twenty
found
there.
And
he
said,
I
will
not
destroy
it
for
twenty's
sake.
018:032
And
he
said,
Oh
let
not
the
LORD
be
angry,
and
I
will
speak
yet
but
this
once:
Peradventure
ten
shall
be
found
there.
And
he
said,
I
will
not
destroy
it
for
ten's
sake.
018:033
And
the
LORD
went
his
way,
as
soon
as
he
had
left
communing
with
Abraham:
and
Abraham
returned
unto
his
place.
019:001
And
there
came
two
angels
to
Sodom
at
even;
and
Lot
sat
in
the
gate
of
Sodom:
and
Lot
seeing
them
rose
up
to
meet
them;
and
he
bowed
himself
with
his
face
toward
the
ground;
019:002
And
he
said,
Behold
now,
my
lords,
turn
in,
I
pray
you,
into
your
servant's
house,
and
tarry
all
night,
and
wash
your
feet,
and
ye
shall
rise
up
early,
and
go
on
your
ways.
And
they
said,
Nay;
but
we
will
abide
in
the
street
all
night.
019:003
And
he
pressed
upon
them
greatly;
and
they
turned
in
unto
him,
and
entered
into
his
house;
and
he
made
them
a
feast,
and
did
bake
unleavened
bread,
and
they
did
eat.
019:004
But
before
they
lay
down,
the
men
of
the
city,
even
the
men
of
Sodom,
compassed
the
house
round,
both
old
and
young,
all
the
people
from
every
quarter:
019:005
And
they
called
unto
Lot,
and
said
unto
him,
Where
are
the
men
which
came
in
to
thee
this
night?
bring
them
out
unto
us,
that
we
may
know
them.
019:006
And
Lot
went
out
at
the
door
unto
them,
and
shut
the
door
after
him,
019:007
And
said,
I
pray
you,
brethren,
do
not
so
wickedly.
019:008
Behold
now,
I
have
two
daughters
which
have
not
known
man;
let
me,
I
pray
you,
bring
them
out
unto
you,
and
do
ye
to
them
as
is
good
in
your
eyes:
only
unto
these
men
do
nothing;
for
therefore
came
they
under
the
shadow
of
my
roof.
019:009
And
they
said,
Stand
back.
And
they
said
again,
This
one
fellow
came
in
to
sojourn,
and
he
will
needs
be
a
judge:
now
will
we
deal
worse
with
thee,
than
with
them.
And
they
pressed
sore
upon
the
man,
even
Lot,
and
came
near
to
break
the
door.
019:010
But
the
men
put
forth
their
hand,
and
pulled
Lot
into
the
house
to
them,
and
shut
to
the
door.
019:011
And
they
smote
the
men
that
were
at
the
door
of
the
house
with
blindness,
both
small
and
great:
so
that
they
wearied
themselves
to
find
the
door.
019:012
And
the
men
said
unto
Lot,
Hast
thou
here
any
besides?
son
in
law,
and
thy
sons,
and
thy
daughters,
and
whatsoever
thou
hast
in
the
city,
bring
them
out
of
this
place:
019:013
For
we
will
destroy
this
place,
because
the
cry
of
them
is
waxen
great
before
the
face
of
the
LORD;
and
the
LORD
hath
sent
us
to
destroy
it.
019:014
And
Lot
went
out,
and
spake
unto
his
sons
in
law,
which
married
his
daughters,
and
said,
Up,
get
you
out
of
this
place;
for
the
LORD
will
destroy
this
city.
But
he
seemed
as
one
that
mocked
unto
his
sons
in
law.
019:015
And
when
the
morning
arose,
then
the
angels
hastened
Lot,
saying,
Arise,
take
thy
wife,
and
thy
two
daughters,
which
are
here;
lest
thou
be
consumed
in
the
iniquity
of
the
city.
019:016
And
while
he
lingered,
the
men
laid
hold
upon
his
hand,
and
upon
the
hand
of
his
wife,
and
upon
the
hand
of
his
two
daughters;
the
LORD
being
merciful
unto
him:
and
they
brought
him
forth,
and
set
him
without
the
city.
019:017
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
had
brought
them
forth
abroad,
that
he
said,
Escape
for
thy
life;
look
not
behind
thee,
neither
stay
thou
in
all
the
plain;
escape
to
the
mountain,
lest
thou
be
consumed.
019:018
And
Lot
said
unto
them,
Oh,
not
so,
my
LORD:
019:019
Behold
now,
thy
servant
hath
found
grace
in
thy
sight,
and
thou
hast
magnified
thy
mercy,
which
thou
hast
shewed
unto
me
in
saving
my
life;
and
I
cannot
escape
to
the
mountain,
lest
some
evil
take
me,
and
I
die:
019:020
Behold
now,
this
city
is
near
to
flee
unto,
and
it
is
a
little
one:
Oh,
let
me
escape
thither,
(is
it
not
a
little
one?)
and
my
soul
shall
live.
019:021
And
he
said
unto
him,
See,
I
have
accepted
thee
concerning
this
thing
also,
that
I
will
not
overthrow
this
city,
for
the
which
thou
hast
spoken.
019:022
Haste
thee,
escape
thither;
for
I
cannot
do
anything
till
thou
be
come
thither.
Therefore
the
name
of
the
city
was
called
Zoar.
019:023
The
sun
was
risen
upon
the
earth
when
Lot
entered
into
Zoar.
019:024
Then
the
LORD
rained
upon
Sodom
and
upon
Gomorrah
brimstone
and
fire
from
the
LORD
out
of
heaven;
019:025
And
he
overthrew
those
cities,
and
all
the
plain,
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
cities,
and
that
which
grew
upon
the
ground.
019:026
But
his
wife
looked
back
from
behind
him,
and
she
became
a
pillar
of
salt.
019:027
And
Abraham
gat
up
early
in
the
morning
to
the
place
where
he
stood
before
the
LORD:
019:028
And
he
looked
toward
Sodom
and
Gomorrah,
and
toward
all
the
land
of
the
plain,
and
beheld,
and,
lo,
the
