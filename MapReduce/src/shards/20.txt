These
shall
ye
eat
of
all
that
are
in
the
waters:
whatsoever
hath
fins
and
scales
in
the
waters,
in
the
seas,
and
in
the
rivers,
them
shall
ye
eat.
011:010
And
all
that
have
not
fins
and
scales
in
the
seas,
and
in
the
rivers,
of
all
that
move
in
the
waters,
and
of
any
living
thing
which
is
in
the
waters,
they
shall
be
an
abomination
unto
you:
011:011
They
shall
be
even
an
abomination
unto
you;
ye
shall
not
eat
of
their
flesh,
but
ye
shall
have
their
carcases
in
abomination.
011:012
Whatsoever
hath
no
fins
nor
scales
in
the
waters,
that
shall
be
an
abomination
unto
you.
011:013
And
these
are
they
which
ye
shall
have
in
abomination
among
the
fowls;
they
shall
not
be
eaten,
they
are
an
abomination:
the
eagle,
and
the
ossifrage,
and
the
ospray,
011:014
And
the
vulture,
and
the
kite
after
his
kind;
011:015
Every
raven
after
his
kind;
011:016
And
the
owl,
and
the
night
hawk,
and
the
cuckow,
and
the
hawk
after
his
kind,
011:017
And
the
little
owl,
and
the
cormorant,
and
the
great
owl,
011:018
And
the
swan,
and
the
pelican,
and
the
gier
eagle,
011:019
And
the
stork,
the
heron
after
her
kind,
and
the
lapwing,
and
the
bat.
011:020
All
fowls
that
creep,
going
upon
all
four,
shall
be
an
abomination
unto
you.
011:021
Yet
these
may
ye
eat
of
every
flying
creeping
thing
that
goeth
upon
all
four,
which
have
legs
above
their
feet,
to
leap
withal
upon
the
earth;
011:022
Even
these
of
them
ye
may
eat;
the
locust
after
his
kind,
and
the
bald
locust
after
his
kind,
and
the
beetle
after
his
kind,
and
the
grasshopper
after
his
kind.
011:023
But
all
other
flying
creeping
things,
which
have
four
feet,
shall
be
an
abomination
unto
you.
011:024
And
for
these
ye
shall
be
unclean:
whosoever
toucheth
the
carcase
of
them
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
011:025
And
whosoever
beareth
ought
of
the
carcase
of
them
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
011:026
The
carcases
of
every
beast
which
divideth
the
hoof,
and
is
not
clovenfooted,
nor
cheweth
the
cud,
are
unclean
unto
you:
every
one
that
toucheth
them
shall
be
unclean.
011:027
And
whatsoever
goeth
upon
his
paws,
among
all
manner
of
beasts
that
go
on
all
four,
those
are
unclean
unto
you:
whoso
toucheth
their
carcase
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
011:028
And
he
that
beareth
the
carcase
of
them
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even:
they
are
unclean
unto
you.
011:029
These
also
shall
be
unclean
unto
you
among
the
creeping
things
that
creep
upon
the
earth;
the
weasel,
and
the
mouse,
and
the
tortoise
after
his
kind,
011:030
And
the
ferret,
and
the
chameleon,
and
the
lizard,
and
the
snail,
and
the
mole.
011:031
These
are
unclean
to
you
among
all
that
creep:
whosoever
doth
touch
them,
when
they
be
dead,
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
011:032
And
upon
whatsoever
any
of
them,
when
they
are
dead,
doth
fall,
it
shall
be
unclean;
whether
it
be
any
vessel
of
wood,
or
raiment,
or
skin,
or
sack,
whatsoever
vessel
it
be,
wherein
any
work
is
done,
it
must
be
put
into
water,
and
it
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even;
so
it
shall
be
cleansed.
011:033
And
every
earthen
vessel,
whereinto
any
of
them
falleth,
whatsoever
is
in
it
shall
be
unclean;
and
ye
shall
break
it.
011:034
Of
all
meat
which
may
be
eaten,
that
on
which
such
water
cometh
shall
be
unclean:
and
all
drink
that
may
be
drunk
in
every
such
vessel
shall
be
unclean.
011:035
And
every
thing
whereupon
any
part
of
their
carcase
falleth
shall
be
unclean;
whether
it
be
oven,
or
ranges
for
pots,
they
shall
be
broken
down:
for
they
are
unclean
and
shall
be
unclean
unto
you.
011:036
Nevertheless
a
fountain
or
pit,
wherein
there
is
plenty
of
water,
shall
be
clean:
but
that
which
toucheth
their
carcase
shall
be
unclean.
011:037
And
if
any
part
of
their
carcase
fall
upon
any
sowing
seed
which
is
to
be
sown,
it
shall
be
clean.
011:038
But
if
any
water
be
put
upon
the
seed,
and
any
part
of
their
carcase
fall
thereon,
it
shall
be
unclean
unto
you.
011:039
And
if
any
beast,
of
which
ye
may
eat,
die;
he
that
toucheth
the
carcase
thereof
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
011:040
And
he
that
eateth
of
the
carcase
of
it
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even:
he
also
that
beareth
the
carcase
of
it
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
011:041
And
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
shall
be
an
abomination;
it
shall
not
be
eaten.
011:042
Whatsoever
goeth
upon
the
belly,
and
whatsoever
goeth
upon
all
four,
or
whatsoever
hath
more
feet
among
all
creeping
things
that
creep
upon
the
earth,
them
ye
shall
not
eat;
for
they
are
an
abomination.
011:043
Ye
shall
not
make
yourselves
abominable
with
any
creeping
thing
that
creepeth,
neither
shall
ye
make
yourselves
unclean
with
them,
that
ye
should
be
defiled
thereby.
011:044
For
I
am
the
LORD
your
God:
ye
shall
therefore
sanctify
yourselves,
and
ye
shall
be
holy;
for
I
am
holy:
neither
shall
ye
defile
yourselves
with
any
manner
of
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth.
011:045
For
I
am
the
LORD
that
bringeth
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
to
be
your
God:
ye
shall
therefore
be
holy,
for
I
am
holy.
011:046
This
is
the
law
of
the
beasts,
and
of
the
fowl,
and
of
every
living
creature
that
moveth
in
the
waters,
and
of
every
creature
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth:
011:047
To
make
a
difference
between
the
unclean
and
the
clean,
and
between
the
beast
that
may
be
eaten
and
the
beast
that
may
not
be
eaten.
012:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
012:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
If
a
woman
have
conceived
seed,
and
born
a
man
child:
then
she
shall
be
unclean
seven
days;
according
to
the
days
of
the
separation
for
her
infirmity
shall
she
be
unclean.
012:003
And
in
the
eighth
day
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin
shall
be
circumcised.
012:004
And
she
shall
then
continue
in
the
blood
of
her
purifying
three
and
thirty
days;
she
shall
touch
no
hallowed
thing,
nor
come
into
the
sanctuary,
until
the
days
of
her
purifying
be
fulfilled.
012:005
But
if
she
bear
a
maid
child,
then
she
shall
be
unclean
two
weeks,
as
in
her
separation:
and
she
shall
continue
in
the
blood
of
her
purifying
threescore
and
six
days.
012:006
And
when
the
days
of
her
purifying
are
fulfilled,
for
a
son,
or
for
a
daughter,
she
shall
bring
a
lamb
of
the
first
year
for
a
burnt
offering,
and
a
young
pigeon,
or
a
turtledove,
for
a
sin
offering,
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
unto
the
priest:
012:007
Who
shall
offer
it
before
the
LORD,
and
make
an
atonement
for
her;
and
she
shall
be
cleansed
from
the
issue
of
her
blood.
This
is
the
law
for
her
that
hath
born
a
male
or
a
female.
012:008
And
if
she
be
not
able
to
bring
a
lamb,
then
she
shall
bring
two
turtles,
or
two
young
pigeons;
the
one
for
the
burnt
offering,
and
the
other
for
a
sin
offering:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
her,
and
she
shall
be
clean.
013:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
Aaron,
saying,
013:002
When
a
man
shall
have
in
the
skin
of
his
flesh
a
rising,
a
scab,
or
bright
spot,
and
it
be
in
the
skin
of
his
flesh
like
the
plague
of
leprosy;
then
he
shall
be
brought
unto
Aaron
the
priest,
or
unto
one
of
his
sons
the
priests:
013:003
And
the
priest
shall
look
on
the
plague
in
the
skin
of
the
flesh:
and
when
the
hair
in
the
plague
is
turned
white,
and
the
plague
in
sight
be
deeper
than
the
skin
of
his
flesh,
it
is
a
plague
of
leprosy:
and
the
priest
shall
look
on
him,
and
pronounce
him
unclean.
013:004
If
the
bright
spot
be
white
in
the
skin
of
his
flesh,
and
in
sight
be
not
deeper
than
the
skin,
and
the
hair
thereof
be
not
turned
white;
then
the
priest
shall
shut
up
him
that
hath
the
plague
seven
days:
013:005
And
the
priest
shall
look
on
him
the
seventh
day:
and,
behold,
if
the
plague
in
his
sight
be
at
a
stay,
and
the
plague
spread
not
in
the
skin;
then
the
priest
shall
shut
him
up
seven
days
more:
013:006
And
the
priest
shall
look
on
him
again
the
seventh
day:
and,
behold,
if
the
plague
be
somewhat
dark,
and
the
plague
spread
not
in
the
skin,
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
clean:
it
is
but
a
scab:
and
he
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
be
clean.
013:007
But
if
the
scab
spread
much
abroad
in
the
skin,
after
that
he
hath
been
seen
of
the
priest
for
his
cleansing,
he
shall
be
seen
of
the
priest
again.
013:008
And
if
the
priest
see
that,
behold,
the
scab
spreadeth
in
the
skin,
then
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
unclean:
it
is
a
leprosy.
013:009
When
the
plague
of
leprosy
is
in
a
man,
then
he
shall
be
brought
unto
the
priest;
013:010
And
the
priest
shall
see
him:
and,
behold,
if
the
rising
be
white
in
the
skin,
and
it
have
turned
the
hair
white,
and
there
be
quick
raw
flesh
in
the
rising;
013:011
It
is
an
old
leprosy
in
the
skin
of
his
flesh,
and
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
unclean,
and
shall
not
shut
him
up:
for
he
is
unclean.
013:012
And
if
a
leprosy
break
out
abroad
in
the
skin,
and
the
leprosy
cover
all
the
skin
of
him
that
hath
the
plague
from
his
head
even
to
his
foot,
wheresoever
the
priest
looketh;
013:013
Then
the
priest
shall
consider:
and,
behold,
if
the
leprosy
have
covered
all
his
flesh,
he
shall
pronounce
him
clean
that
hath
the
plague:
it
is
all
turned
white:
he
is
clean.
013:014
But
when
raw
flesh
appeareth
in
him,
he
shall
be
unclean.
013:015
And
the
priest
shall
see
the
raw
flesh,
and
pronounce
him
to
be
unclean:
for
the
raw
flesh
is
unclean:
it
is
a
leprosy.
013:016
Or
if
the
raw
flesh
turn
again,
and
be
changed
unto
white,
he
shall
come
unto
the
priest;
013:017
And
the
priest
shall
see
him:
and,
behold,
if
the
plague
be
turned
into
white;
then
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
clean
that
hath
the
plague:
he
is
clean.
013:018
The
flesh
also,
in
which,
even
in
the
skin
thereof,
was
a
boil,
and
is
healed,
013:019
And
in
the
place
of
the
boil
there
be
a
white
rising,
or
a
bright
spot,
white,
and
somewhat
reddish,
and
it
be
shewed
to
the
priest;
013:020
And
if,
when
the
priest
seeth
it,
behold,
it
be
in
sight
lower
than
the
skin,
and
the
hair
thereof
be
turned
white;
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
unclean:
it
is
a
plague
of
leprosy
broken
out
of
the
boil.
013:021
But
if
the
priest
look
on
it,
and,
behold,
there
be
no
white
hairs
therein,
and
if
it
be
not
lower
than
the
skin,
but
be
somewhat
dark;
then
the
priest
shall
shut
him
up
seven
days:
013:022
And
if
it
spread
much
abroad
in
the
skin,
then
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
unclean:
it
is
a
plague.
013:023
But
if
the
bright
spot
stay
in
his
place,
and
spread
not,
it
is
a
burning
boil;
and
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
clean.
013:024
Or
if
there
be
any
flesh,
in
the
skin
whereof
there
is
a
hot
burning,
and
the
quick
flesh
that
burneth
have
a
white
bright
spot,
somewhat
reddish,
or
white;
013:025
Then
the
priest
shall
look
upon
it:
and,
behold,
if
the
hair
in
the
bright
spot
be
turned
white,
and
it
be
in
sight
deeper
than
the
skin;
it
is
a
leprosy
broken
out
of
the
burning:
wherefore
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
unclean:
it
is
the
plague
of
leprosy.
013:026
But
if
the
priest
look
on
it,
and,
behold,
there
be
no
white
hair
in
the
bright
spot,
and
it
be
no
lower
than
the
other
skin,
but
be
somewhat
dark;
then
the
priest
shall
shut
him
up
seven
days:
013:027
And
the
priest
shall
look
upon
him
the
seventh
day:
and
if
it
be
spread
much
abroad
in
the
skin,
then
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
unclean:
it
is
the
plague
of
leprosy.
013:028
And
if
the
bright
spot
stay
in
his
place,
and
spread
not
in
the
skin,
but
it
be
somewhat
dark;
it
is
a
rising
of
the
burning,
and
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
clean:
for
it
is
an
inflammation
of
the
burning.
013:029
If
a
man
or
woman
have
a
plague
upon
the
head
or
the
beard;
013:030
Then
the
priest
shall
see
the
plague:
and,
behold,
if
it
be
in
sight
deeper
than
the
skin;
and
there
be
in
it
a
yellow
thin
hair;
then
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
unclean:
it
is
a
dry
scall,
even
a
leprosy
upon
the
head
or
beard.
013:031
And
if
the
priest
look
on
the
plague
of
the
scall,
and,
behold,
it
be
not
in
sight
deeper
than
the
skin,
and
that
there
is
no
black
hair
in
it;
then
the
priest
shall
shut
up
him
that
hath
the
plague
of
the
scall
seven
days:
013:032
And
in
the
seventh
day
the
priest
shall
look
on
the
plague:
and,
behold,
if
the
scall
spread
not,
and
there
be
in
it
no
yellow
hair,
and
the
scall
be
not
in
sight
deeper
than
the
skin;
013:033
He
shall
be
shaven,
but
the
scall
shall
he
not
shave;
and
the
priest
shall
shut
up
him
that
hath
the
scall
seven
days
more:
013:034
And
in
the
seventh
day
the
priest
shall
look
on
the
scall:
and,
behold,
if
the
scall
be
not
spread
in
the
skin,
nor
be
in
sight
deeper
than
the
skin;
then
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
clean:
and
he
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
be
clean.
013:035
But
if
the
scall
spread
much
in
the
skin
after
his
cleansing;
013:036
Then
the
priest
shall
look
on
him:
and,
behold,
if
the
scall
be
spread
in
the
skin,
the
priest
shall
not
seek
for
yellow
hair;
he
is
unclean.
013:037
But
if
the
scall
be
in
his
sight
at
a
stay,
and
that
there
is
black
hair
grown
up
therein;
the
scall
is
healed,
he
is
clean:
and
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
clean.
013:038
If
a
man
also
or
a
woman
have
in
the
skin
of
their
flesh
bright
spots,
even
white
bright
spots;
013:039
Then
the
priest
shall
look:
and,
behold,
if
the
bright
spots
in
the
skin
of
their
flesh
be
darkish
white;
it
is
a
freckled
spot
that
groweth
in
the
skin;
he
is
clean.
013:040
And
the
man
whose
hair
is
fallen
off
his
head,
he
is
bald;
yet
is
he
clean.
013:041
And
he
that
hath
his
hair
fallen
off
from
the
part
of
his
head
toward
his
face,
he
is
forehead
bald:
yet
is
he
clean.
013:042
And
if
there
be
in
the
bald
head,
or
bald
forehead,
a
white
reddish
sore;
it
is
a
leprosy
sprung
up
in
his
bald
head,
or
his
bald
forehead.
013:043
Then
the
priest
shall
look
upon
it:
and,
behold,
if
the
rising
of
the
sore
be
white
reddish
in
his
bald
head,
or
in
his
bald
forehead,
as
the
leprosy
appeareth
in
the
skin
of
the
flesh;
013:044
He
is
a
leprous
man,
he
is
unclean:
the
priest
shall
pronounce
him
utterly
unclean;
his
plague
is
in
his
head.
013:045
And
the
leper
in
whom
the
plague
is,
his
clothes
shall
be
rent,
and
his
head
bare,
and
he
shall
put
a
covering
upon
his
upper
lip,
and
shall
cry,
Unclean,
unclean.
013:046
All
the
days
wherein
the
plague
shall
be
in
him
he
shall
be
defiled;
he
is
unclean:
he
shall
dwell
alone;
without
the
camp
shall
his
habitation
be.
013:047
The
garment
also
that
the
plague
of
leprosy
is
in,
whether
it
be
a
woollen
garment,
or
a
linen
garment;
013:048
Whether
it
be
in
the
warp,
or
woof;
of
linen,
or
of
woollen;
whether
in
a
skin,
or
in
any
thing
made
of
skin;
013:049
And
if
the
plague
be
greenish
or
reddish
in
the
garment,
or
in
the
skin,
either
in
the
warp,
or
in
the
woof,
or
in
any
thing
of
skin;
it
is
a
plague
of
leprosy,
and
shall
be
shewed
unto
the
priest:
013:050
And
the
priest
shall
look
upon
the
plague,
and
shut
up
it
that
hath
the
plague
seven
days:
013:051
And
he
shall
look
on
the
plague
on
the
seventh
day:
if
the
plague
be
spread
in
the
garment,
either
in
the
warp,
or
in
the
woof,
or
in
a
skin,
or
in
any
work
that
is
made
of
skin;
the
plague
is
a
fretting
leprosy;
it
is
unclean.
013:052
He
shall
therefore
burn
that
garment,
whether
warp
or
woof,
in
woollen
or
in
linen,
or
any
thing
of
skin,
wherein
the
plague
is:
for
it
is
a
fretting
leprosy;
it
shall
be
burnt
in
the
fire.
013:053
And
if
the
priest
shall
look,
and,
behold,
the
plague
be
not
spread
in
the
garment,
either
in
the
warp,
or
in
the
woof,
or
in
any
thing
of
skin;
013:054
Then
the
priest
shall
command
that
they
wash
the
thing
wherein
the
plague
is,
and
he
shall
shut
it
up
seven
days
more:
013:055
And
the
priest
shall
look
on
the
plague,
after
that
it
is
washed:
and,
behold,
if
the
plague
have
not
changed
his
colour,
and
the
plague
be
not
spread;
it
is
unclean;
thou
shalt
burn
it
in
the
fire;
it
is
fret
inward,
whether
it
be
bare
within
or
without.
013:056
And
if
the
priest
look,
and,
behold,
the
plague
be
somewhat
dark
after
the
washing
of
it;
then
he
shall
rend
it
out
of
the
garment,
or
out
of
the
skin,
or
out
of
the
warp,
or
out
of
the
woof:
013:057
And
if
it
appear
still
in
the
garment,
either
in
the
warp,
or
in
the
woof,
or
in
any
thing
of
skin;
it
is
a
spreading
plague:
thou
shalt
burn
that
wherein
the
plague
is
with
fire.
013:058
And
the
garment,
either
warp,
or
woof,
or
whatsoever
thing
of
skin
it
be,
which
thou
shalt
wash,
if
the
plague
be
departed
from
them,
then
it
shall
be
washed
the
second
time,
and
shall
be
clean.
013:059
This
is
the
law
of
the
plague
of
leprosy
in
a
garment
of
woollen
or
linen,
either
in
the
warp,
or
woof,
or
any
thing
of
skins,
to
pronounce
it
clean,
or
to
pronounce
it
unclean.
014:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
014:002
This
shall
be
the
law
of
the
leper
in
the
day
of
his
cleansing:
He
shall
be
brought
unto
the
priest:
014:003
And
the
priest
shall
go
forth
out
of
the
camp;
and
the
priest
shall
look,
and,
behold,
if
the
plague
of
leprosy
be
healed
in
the
leper;
014:004
Then
shall
the
priest
command
to
take
for
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed
two
birds
alive
and
clean,
and
cedar
wood,
and
scarlet,
and
hyssop:
014:005
And
the
priest
shall
command
that
one
of
the
birds
be
killed
in
an
earthen
vessel
over
running
water:
014:006
As
for
the
living
bird,
he
shall
take
it,
and
the
cedar
wood,
and
the
scarlet,
and
the
hyssop,
and
shall
dip
them
and
the
living
bird
in
the
blood
of
the
bird
that
was
killed
over
the
running
water:
014:007
And
he
shall
sprinkle
upon
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed
from
the
leprosy
seven
times,
and
shall
pronounce
him
clean,
and
shall
let
the
living
bird
loose
into
the
open
field.
014:008
And
he
that
is
to
be
cleansed
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
shave
off
all
his
hair,
and
wash
himself
in
water,
that
he
may
be
clean:
and
after
that
he
shall
come
into
the
camp,
and
shall
tarry
abroad
out
of
his
tent
seven
days.
014:009
But
it
shall
be
on
the
seventh
day,
that
he
shall
shave
all
his
hair
off
his
head
and
his
beard
and
his
eyebrows,
even
all
his
hair
he
shall
shave
off:
and
he
shall
wash
his
clothes,
also
he
shall
wash
his
flesh
in
water,
and
he
shall
be
clean.
014:010
And
on
the
eighth
day
he
shall
take
two
he
lambs
without
blemish,
and
one
ewe
lamb
of
the
first
year
without
blemish,
and
three
tenth
deals
of
fine
flour
for
a
meat
offering,
mingled
with
oil,
and
one
log
of
oil.
014:011
And
the
priest
that
maketh
him
clean
shall
present
the
man
that
is
to
be
made
clean,
and
those
things,
before
the
LORD,
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
014:012
And
the
priest
shall
take
one
he
lamb,
and
offer
him
for
a
trespass
offering,
and
the
log
of
oil,
and
wave
them
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD:
014:013
And
he
shall
slay
the
lamb
in
the
place
where
he
shall
kill
the
sin
offering
and
the
burnt
offering,
in
the
holy
place:
for
as
the
sin
offering
is
the
priest's,
so
is
the
trespass
offering:
it
is
most
holy:
014:014
And
the
priest
shall
take
some
of
the
blood
of
the
trespass
offering,
and
the
priest
shall
put
it
upon
the
tip
of
the
right
ear
of
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed,
and
upon
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand,
and
upon
the
great
toe
of
his
right
foot:
014:015
And
the
priest
shall
take
some
of
the
log
of
oil,
and
pour
it
into
the
palm
of
his
own
left
hand:
014:016
And
the
priest
shall
dip
his
right
finger
in
the
oil
that
is
in
his
left
hand,
and
shall
sprinkle
of
the
oil
with
his
finger
seven
times
before
the
LORD:
014:017
And
of
the
rest
of
the
oil
that
is
in
his
hand
shall
the
priest
put
upon
the
tip
of
the
right
ear
of
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed,
and
upon
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand,
and
upon
the
great
toe
of
his
right
foot,
upon
the
blood
of
the
trespass
offering:
014:018
And
the
remnant
of
the
oil
that
is
in
the
priest's
hand
he
shall
pour
upon
the
head
of
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
before
the
LORD.
014:019
And
the
priest
shall
offer
the
sin
offering,
and
make
an
atonement
for
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed
from
his
uncleanness;
and
afterward
he
shall
kill
the
burnt
offering:
014:020
And
the
priest
shall
offer
the
burnt
offering
and
the
meat
offering
upon
the
altar:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him,
and
he
shall
be
clean.
014:021
And
if
he
be
poor,
and
cannot
get
so
much;
then
he
shall
take
one
lamb
for
a
trespass
offering
to
be
waved,
to
make
an
atonement
for
him,
and
one
tenth
deal
of
fine
flour
mingled
with
oil
for
a
meat
offering,
and
a
log
of
oil;
014:022
And
two
turtledoves,
or
two
young
pigeons,
such
as
he
is
able
to
get;
and
the
one
shall
be
a
sin
offering,
and
the
other
a
burnt
offering.
014:023
And
he
shall
bring
them
on
the
eighth
day
for
his
cleansing
unto
the
priest,
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
before
the
LORD.
014:024
And
the
priest
shall
take
the
lamb
of
the
trespass
offering,
and
the
log
of
oil,
and
the
priest
shall
wave
them
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD:
014:025
And
he
shall
kill
the
lamb
of
the
trespass
offering,
and
the
priest
shall
take
some
of
the
blood
of
the
trespass
offering,
and
put
it
upon
the
tip
of
the
right
ear
of
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed,
and
upon
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand,
and
upon
the
great
toe
of
his
right
foot:
014:026
And
the
priest
shall
pour
of
the
oil
into
the
palm
of
his
own
left
hand:
014:027
And
the
priest
shall
sprinkle
with
his
right
finger
some
of
the
oil
that
is
in
his
left
hand
seven
times
before
the
LORD:
014:028
And
