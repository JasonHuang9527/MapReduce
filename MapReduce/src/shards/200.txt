sat
upon
the
horse,
which
sword
proceeded
out
of
his
mouth:
and
all
the
fowls
were
filled
with
their
flesh.
020:001
And
I
saw
an
angel
come
down
from
heaven,
having
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
a
great
chain
in
his
hand.
020:002
And
he
laid
hold
on
the
dragon,
that
old
serpent,
which
is
the
Devil,
and
Satan,
and
bound
him
a
thousand
years,
020:003
And
cast
him
into
the
bottomless
pit,
and
shut
him
up,
and
set
a
seal
upon
him,
that
he
should
deceive
the
nations
no
more,
till
the
thousand
years
should
be
fulfilled:
and
after
that
he
must
be
loosed
a
little
season.
020:004
And
I
saw
thrones,
and
they
sat
upon
them,
and
judgment
was
given
unto
them:
and
I
saw
the
souls
of
them
that
were
beheaded
for
the
witness
of
Jesus,
and
for
the
word
of
God,
and
which
had
not
worshipped
the
beast,
neither
his
image,
neither
had
received
his
mark
upon
their
foreheads,
or
in
their
hands;
and
they
lived
and
reigned
with
Christ
a
thousand
years.
020:005
But
the
rest
of
the
dead
lived
not
again
until
the
thousand
years
were
finished.
This
is
the
first
resurrection.
020:006
Blessed
and
holy
is
he
that
hath
part
in
the
first
resurrection:
on
such
the
second
death
hath
no
power,
but
they
shall
be
priests
of
God
and
of
Christ,
and
shall
reign
with
him
a
thousand
years.
020:007
And
when
the
thousand
years
are
expired,
Satan
shall
be
loosed
out
of
his
prison,
020:008
And
shall
go
out
to
deceive
the
nations
which
are
in
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth,
Gog,
and
Magog,
to
gather
them
together
to
battle:
the
number
of
whom
is
as
the
sand
of
the
sea.
020:009
And
they
went
up
on
the
breadth
of
the
earth,
and
compassed
the
camp
of
the
saints
about,
and
the
beloved
city:
and
fire
came
down
from
God
out
of
heaven,
and
devoured
them.
020:010
And
the
devil
that
deceived
them
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone,
where
the
beast
and
the
false
prophet
are,
and
shall
be
tormented
day
and
night
for
ever
and
ever.
020:011
And
I
saw
a
great
white
throne,
and
him
that
sat
on
it,
from
whose
face
the
earth
and
the
heaven
fled
away;
and
there
was
found
no
place
for
them.
020:012
And
I
saw
the
dead,
small
and
great,
stand
before
God;
and
the
books
were
opened:
and
another
book
was
opened,
which
is
the
book
of
life:
and
the
dead
were
judged
out
of
those
things
which
were
written
in
the
books,
according
to
their
works.
020:013
And
the
sea
gave
up
the
dead
which
were
in
it;
and
death
and
hell
delivered
up
the
dead
which
were
in
them:
and
they
were
judged
every
man
according
to
their
works.
020:014
And
death
and
hell
were
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire.
This
is
the
second
death.
020:015
And
whosoever
was
not
found
written
in
the
book
of
life
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire.
021:001
And
I
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth:
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
passed
away;
and
there
was
no
more
sea.
021:002
And
I
John
saw
the
holy
city,
new
Jerusalem,
coming
down
from
God
out
of
heaven,
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband.
021:003
And
I
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
heaven
saying,
Behold,
the
tabernacle
of
God
is
with
men,
and
he
will
dwell
with
them,
and
they
shall
be
his
people,
and
God
himself
shall
be
with
them,
and
be
their
God.
021:004
And
God
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes;
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death,
neither
sorrow,
nor
crying,
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain:
for
the
former
things
are
passed
away.
021:005
And
he
that
sat
upon
the
throne
said,
Behold,
I
make
all
things
new.
And
he
said
unto
me,
Write:
for
these
words
are
true
and
faithful.
021:006
And
he
said
unto
me,
It
is
done.
I
am
Alpha
and
Omega,
the
beginning
and
the
end.
I
will
give
unto
him
that
is
athirst
of
the
fountain
of
the
water
of
life
freely.
021:007
He
that
overcometh
shall
inherit
all
things;
and
I
will
be
his
God,
and
he
shall
be
my
son.
021:008
But
the
fearful,
and
unbelieving,
and
the
abominable,
and
murderers,
and
whoremongers,
and
sorcerers,
and
idolaters,
and
all
liars,
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone:
which
is
the
second
death.
021:009
And
there
came
unto
me
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
vials
full
of
the
seven
last
plagues,
and
talked
with
me,
saying,
Come
hither,
I
will
shew
thee
the
bride,
the
Lamb's
wife.
021:010
And
he
carried
me
away
in
the
spirit
to
a
great
and
high
mountain,
and
shewed
me
that
great
city,
the
holy
Jerusalem,
descending
out
of
heaven
from
God,
021:011
Having
the
glory
of
God:
and
her
light
was
like
unto
a
stone
most
precious,
even
like
a
jasper
stone,
clear
as
crystal;
021:012
And
had
a
wall
great
and
high,
and
had
twelve
gates,
and
at
the
gates
twelve
angels,
and
names
written
thereon,
which
are
the
names
of
the
twelve
tribes
of
the
children
of
Israel:
021:013
On
the
east
three
gates;
on
the
north
three
gates;
on
the
south
three
gates;
and
on
the
west
three
gates.
021:014
And
the
wall
of
the
city
had
twelve
foundations,
and
in
them
the
names
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
Lamb.
021:015
And
he
that
talked
with
me
had
a
golden
reed
to
measure
the
city,
and
the
gates
thereof,
and
the
wall
thereof.
021:016
And
the
city
lieth
foursquare,
and
the
length
is
as
large
as
the
breadth:
and
he
measured
the
city
with
the
reed,
twelve
thousand
furlongs.
The
length
and
the
breadth
and
the
height
of
it
are
equal.
021:017
And
he
measured
the
wall
thereof,
an
hundred
and
forty
and
four
cubits,
according
to
the
measure
of
a
man,
that
is,
of
the
angel.
021:018
And
the
building
of
the
wall
of
it
was
of
jasper:
and
the
city
was
pure
gold,
like
unto
clear
glass.
021:019
And
the
foundations
of
the
wall
of
the
city
were
garnished
with
all
manner
of
precious
stones.
The
first
foundation
was
jasper;
the
second,
sapphire;
the
third,
a
chalcedony;
the
fourth,
an
emerald;
021:020
The
fifth,
sardonyx;
the
sixth,
sardius;
the
seventh,
chrysolyte;
the
eighth,
beryl;
the
ninth,
a
topaz;
the
tenth,
a
chrysoprasus;
the
eleventh,
a
jacinth;
the
twelfth,
an
amethyst.
021:021
And
the
twelve
gates
were
twelve
pearls:
every
several
gate
was
of
one
pearl:
and
the
street
of
the
city
was
pure
gold,
as
it
were
transparent
glass.
021:022
And
I
saw
no
temple
therein:
for
the
Lord
God
Almighty
and
the
Lamb
are
the
temple
of
it.
021:023
And
the
city
had
no
need
of
the
sun,
neither
of
the
moon,
to
shine
in
it:
for
the
glory
of
God
did
lighten
it,
and
the
Lamb
is
the
light
thereof.
021:024
And
the
nations
of
them
which
are
saved
shall
walk
in
the
light
of
it:
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
do
bring
their
glory
and
honour
into
it.
021:025
And
the
gates
of
it
shall
not
be
shut
at
all
by
day:
for
there
shall
be
no
night
there.
021:026
And
they
shall
bring
the
glory
and
honour
of
the
nations
into
it.
021:027
And
there
shall
in
no
wise
enter
into
it
any
thing
that
defileth,
neither
whatsoever
worketh
abomination,
or
maketh
a
lie:
but
they
which
are
written
in
the
Lamb's
book
of
life.
022:001
And
he
shewed
me
a
pure
river
of
water
of
life,
clear
as
crystal,
proceeding
out
of
the
throne
of
God
and
of
the
Lamb.
022:002
In
the
midst
of
the
street
of
it,
and
on
either
side
of
the
river,
was
there
the
tree
of
life,
which
bare
twelve
manner
of
fruits,
and
yielded
her
fruit
every
month:
and
the
leaves
of
the
tree
were
for
the
healing
of
the
nations.
022:003
And
there
shall
be
no
more
curse:
but
the
throne
of
God
and
of
the
Lamb
shall
be
in
it;
and
his
servants
shall
serve
him:
022:004
And
they
shall
see
his
face;
and
his
name
shall
be
in
their
foreheads.
022:005
And
there
shall
be
no
night
there;
and
they
need
no
candle,
neither
light
of
the
sun;
for
the
Lord
God
giveth
them
light:
and
they
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever.
022:006
And
he
said
unto
me,
These
sayings
are
faithful
and
true:
and
the
Lord
God
of
the
holy
prophets
sent
his
angel
to
shew
unto
his
servants
the
things
which
must
shortly
be
done.
022:007
Behold,
I
come
quickly:
blessed
is
he
that
keepeth
the
sayings
of
the
prophecy
of
this
book.
022:008
And
I
John
saw
these
things,
and
heard
them.
And
when
I
had
heard
and
seen,
I
fell
down
to
worship
before
the
feet
of
the
angel
which
shewed
me
these
things.
022:009
Then
saith
he
unto
me,
See
thou
do
it
not:
for
I
am
thy
fellowservant,
and
of
thy
brethren
the
prophets,
and
of
them
which
keep
the
sayings
of
this
book:
worship
God.
022:010
And
he
saith
unto
me,
Seal
not
the
sayings
of
the
prophecy
of
this
book:
for
the
time
is
at
hand.
022:011
He
that
is
unjust,
let
him
be
unjust
still:
and
he
which
is
filthy,
let
him
be
filthy
still:
and
he
that
is
righteous,
let
him
be
righteous
still:
and
he
that
is
holy,
let
him
be
holy
still.
022:012
And,
behold,
I
come
quickly;
and
my
reward
is
with
me,
to
give
every
man
according
as
his
work
shall
be.
022:013
I
am
Alpha
and
Omega,
the
beginning
and
the
end,
the
first
and
the
last.
022:014
Blessed
are
they
that
do
his
commandments,
that
they
may
have
right
to
the
tree
of
life,
and
may
enter
in
through
the
gates
into
the
city.
022:015
For
without
are
dogs,
and
sorcerers,
and
whoremongers,
and
murderers,
and
idolaters,
and
whosoever
loveth
and
maketh
a
lie.
022:016
I
Jesus
have
sent
mine
angel
to
testify
unto
you
these
things
in
the
churches.
I
am
the
root
and
the
offspring
of
David,
and
the
bright
and
morning
star.
022:017
And
the
Spirit
and
the
bride
say,
Come.
And
let
him
that
heareth
say,
Come.
And
let
him
that
is
athirst
come.
And
whosoever
will,
let
him
take
the
water
of
life
freely.
022:018
For
I
testify
unto
every
man
that
heareth
the
words
of
the
prophecy
of
this
book,
If
any
man
shall
add
unto
these
things,
God
shall
add
unto
him
the
plagues
that
are
written
in
this
book:
022:019
And
if
any
man
shall
take
away
from
the
words
of
the
book
of
this
prophecy,
God
shall
take
away
his
part
out
of
the
book
of
life,
and
out
of
the
holy
city,
and
from
the
things
which
are
written
in
this
book.
022:020
He
which
testifieth
these
things
saith,
Surely
I
come
quickly.
Amen.
Even
so,
come,
Lord
Jesus.
022:021
The
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
you
all.
Amen.
