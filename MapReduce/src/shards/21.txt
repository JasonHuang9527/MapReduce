the
priest
shall
put
of
the
oil
that
is
in
his
hand
upon
the
tip
of
the
right
ear
of
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed,
and
upon
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand,
and
upon
the
great
toe
of
his
right
foot,
upon
the
place
of
the
blood
of
the
trespass
offering:
014:029
And
the
rest
of
the
oil
that
is
in
the
priest's
hand
he
shall
put
upon
the
head
of
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed,
to
make
an
atonement
for
him
before
the
LORD.
014:030
And
he
shall
offer
the
one
of
the
turtledoves,
or
of
the
young
pigeons,
such
as
he
can
get;
014:031
Even
such
as
he
is
able
to
get,
the
one
for
a
sin
offering,
and
the
other
for
a
burnt
offering,
with
the
meat
offering:
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
that
is
to
be
cleansed
before
the
LORD.
014:032
This
is
the
law
of
him
in
whom
is
the
plague
of
leprosy,
whose
hand
is
not
able
to
get
that
which
pertaineth
to
his
cleansing.
014:033
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron,
saying,
014:034
When
ye
be
come
into
the
land
of
Canaan,
which
I
give
to
you
for
a
possession,
and
I
put
the
plague
of
leprosy
in
a
house
of
the
land
of
your
possession;
014:035
And
he
that
owneth
the
house
shall
come
and
tell
the
priest,
saying,
It
seemeth
to
me
there
is
as
it
were
a
plague
in
the
house:
014:036
Then
the
priest
shall
command
that
they
empty
the
house,
before
the
priest
go
into
it
to
see
the
plague,
that
all
that
is
in
the
house
be
not
made
unclean:
and
afterward
the
priest
shall
go
in
to
see
the
house:
014:037
And
he
shall
look
on
the
plague,
and,
behold,
if
the
plague
be
in
the
walls
of
the
house
with
hollow
strakes,
greenish
or
reddish,
which
in
sight
are
lower
than
the
wall;
014:038
Then
the
priest
shall
go
out
of
the
house
to
the
door
of
the
house,
and
shut
up
the
house
seven
days:
014:039
And
the
priest
shall
come
again
the
seventh
day,
and
shall
look:
and,
behold,
if
the
plague
be
spread
in
the
walls
of
the
house;
014:040
Then
the
priest
shall
command
that
they
take
away
the
stones
in
which
the
plague
is,
and
they
shall
cast
them
into
an
unclean
place
without
the
city:
014:041
And
he
shall
cause
the
house
to
be
scraped
within
round
about,
and
they
shall
pour
out
the
dust
that
they
scrape
off
without
the
city
into
an
unclean
place:
014:042
And
they
shall
take
other
stones,
and
put
them
in
the
place
of
those
stones;
and
he
shall
take
other
morter,
and
shall
plaister
the
house.
014:043
And
if
the
plague
come
again,
and
break
out
in
the
house,
after
that
he
hath
taken
away
the
stones,
and
after
he
hath
scraped
the
house,
and
after
it
is
plaistered;
014:044
Then
the
priest
shall
come
and
look,
and,
behold,
if
the
plague
be
spread
in
the
house,
it
is
a
fretting
leprosy
in
the
house;
it
is
unclean.
014:045
And
he
shall
break
down
the
house,
the
stones
of
it,
and
the
timber
thereof,
and
all
the
morter
of
the
house;
and
he
shall
carry
them
forth
out
of
the
city
into
an
unclean
place.
014:046
Moreover
he
that
goeth
into
the
house
all
the
while
that
it
is
shut
up
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
014:047
And
he
that
lieth
in
the
house
shall
wash
his
clothes;
and
he
that
eateth
in
the
house
shall
wash
his
clothes.
014:048
And
if
the
priest
shall
come
in,
and
look
upon
it,
and,
behold,
the
plague
hath
not
spread
in
the
house,
after
the
house
was
plaistered:
then
the
priest
shall
pronounce
the
house
clean,
because
the
plague
is
healed.
014:049
And
he
shall
take
to
cleanse
the
house
two
birds,
and
cedar
wood,
and
scarlet,
and
hyssop:
014:050
And
he
shall
kill
the
one
of
the
birds
in
an
earthen
vessel
over
running
water:
014:051
And
he
shall
take
the
cedar
wood,
and
the
hyssop,
and
the
scarlet,
and
the
living
bird,
and
dip
them
in
the
blood
of
the
slain
bird,
and
in
the
running
water,
and
sprinkle
the
house
seven
times:
014:052
And
he
shall
cleanse
the
house
with
the
blood
of
the
bird,
and
with
the
running
water,
and
with
the
living
bird,
and
with
the
cedar
wood,
and
with
the
hyssop,
and
with
the
scarlet:
014:053
But
he
shall
let
go
the
living
bird
out
of
the
city
into
the
open
fields,
and
make
an
atonement
for
the
house:
and
it
shall
be
clean.
014:054
This
is
the
law
for
all
manner
of
plague
of
leprosy,
and
scall,
014:055
And
for
the
leprosy
of
a
garment,
and
of
a
house,
014:056
And
for
a
rising,
and
for
a
scab,
and
for
a
bright
spot:
014:057
To
teach
when
it
is
unclean,
and
when
it
is
clean:
this
is
the
law
of
leprosy.
015:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
to
Aaron,
saying,
015:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
any
man
hath
a
running
issue
out
of
his
flesh,
because
of
his
issue
he
is
unclean.
015:003
And
this
shall
be
his
uncleanness
in
his
issue:
whether
his
flesh
run
with
his
issue,
or
his
flesh
be
stopped
from
his
issue,
it
is
his
uncleanness.
015:004
Every
bed,
whereon
he
lieth
that
hath
the
issue,
is
unclean:
and
every
thing,
whereon
he
sitteth,
shall
be
unclean.
015:005
And
whosoever
toucheth
his
bed
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:006
And
he
that
sitteth
on
any
thing
whereon
he
sat
that
hath
the
issue
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:007
And
he
that
toucheth
the
flesh
of
him
that
hath
the
issue
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:008
And
if
he
that
hath
the
issue
spit
upon
him
that
is
clean;
then
he
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:009
And
what
saddle
soever
he
rideth
upon
that
hath
the
issue
shall
be
unclean.
015:010
And
whosoever
toucheth
any
thing
that
was
under
him
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even:
and
he
that
beareth
any
of
those
things
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:011
And
whomsoever
he
toucheth
that
hath
the
issue,
and
hath
not
rinsed
his
hands
in
water,
he
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:012
And
the
vessel
of
earth,
that
he
toucheth
which
hath
the
issue,
shall
be
broken:
and
every
vessel
of
wood
shall
be
rinsed
in
water.
015:013
And
when
he
that
hath
an
issue
is
cleansed
of
his
issue;
then
he
shall
number
to
himself
seven
days
for
his
cleansing,
and
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
his
flesh
in
running
water,
and
shall
be
clean.
015:014
And
on
the
eighth
day
he
shall
take
to
him
two
turtledoves,
or
two
young
pigeons,
and
come
before
the
LORD
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
give
them
unto
the
priest:
015:015
And
the
priest
shall
offer
them,
the
one
for
a
sin
offering,
and
the
other
for
a
burnt
offering;
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
before
the
LORD
for
his
issue.
015:016
And
if
any
man's
seed
of
copulation
go
out
from
him,
then
he
shall
wash
all
his
flesh
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:017
And
every
garment,
and
every
skin,
whereon
is
the
seed
of
copulation,
shall
be
washed
with
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:018
The
woman
also
with
whom
man
shall
lie
with
seed
of
copulation,
they
shall
both
bathe
themselves
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:019
And
if
a
woman
have
an
issue,
and
her
issue
in
her
flesh
be
blood,
she
shall
be
put
apart
seven
days:
and
whosoever
toucheth
her
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:020
And
every
thing
that
she
lieth
upon
in
her
separation
shall
be
unclean:
every
thing
also
that
she
sitteth
upon
shall
be
unclean.
015:021
And
whosoever
toucheth
her
bed
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:022
And
whosoever
toucheth
any
thing
that
she
sat
upon
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:023
And
if
it
be
on
her
bed,
or
on
any
thing
whereon
she
sitteth,
when
he
toucheth
it,
he
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:024
And
if
any
man
lie
with
her
at
all,
and
her
flowers
be
upon
him,
he
shall
be
unclean
seven
days;
and
all
the
bed
whereon
he
lieth
shall
be
unclean.
015:025
And
if
a
woman
have
an
issue
of
her
blood
many
days
out
of
the
time
of
her
separation,
or
if
it
run
beyond
the
time
of
her
separation;
all
the
days
of
the
issue
of
her
uncleanness
shall
be
as
the
days
of
her
separation:
she
shall
be
unclean.
015:026
Every
bed
whereon
she
lieth
all
the
days
of
her
issue
shall
be
unto
her
as
the
bed
of
her
separation:
and
whatsoever
she
sitteth
upon
shall
be
unclean,
as
the
uncleanness
of
her
separation.
015:027
And
whosoever
toucheth
those
things
shall
be
unclean,
and
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even.
015:028
But
if
she
be
cleansed
of
her
issue,
then
she
shall
number
to
herself
seven
days,
and
after
that
she
shall
be
clean.
015:029
And
on
the
eighth
day
she
shall
take
unto
her
two
turtles,
or
two
young
pigeons,
and
bring
them
unto
the
priest,
to
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
015:030
And
the
priest
shall
offer
the
one
for
a
sin
offering,
and
the
other
for
a
burnt
offering;
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
her
before
the
LORD
for
the
issue
of
her
uncleanness.
015:031
Thus
shall
ye
separate
the
children
of
Israel
from
their
uncleanness;
that
they
die
not
in
their
uncleanness,
when
they
defile
my
tabernacle
that
is
among
them.
015:032
This
is
the
law
of
him
that
hath
an
issue,
and
of
him
whose
seed
goeth
from
him,
and
is
defiled
therewith;
015:033
And
of
her
that
is
sick
of
her
flowers,
and
of
him
that
hath
an
issue,
of
the
man,
and
of
the
woman,
and
of
him
that
lieth
with
her
that
is
unclean.
016:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
after
the
death
of
the
two
sons
of
Aaron,
when
they
offered
before
the
LORD,
and
died;
016:002
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Speak
unto
Aaron
thy
brother,
that
he
come
not
at
all
times
into
the
holy
place
within
the
vail
before
the
mercy
seat,
which
is
upon
the
ark;
that
he
die
not:
for
I
will
appear
in
the
cloud
upon
the
mercy
seat.
016:003
Thus
shall
Aaron
come
into
the
holy
place:
with
a
young
bullock
for
a
sin
offering,
and
a
ram
for
a
burnt
offering.
016:004
He
shall
put
on
the
holy
linen
coat,
and
he
shall
have
the
linen
breeches
upon
his
flesh,
and
shall
be
girded
with
a
linen
girdle,
and
with
the
linen
mitre
shall
he
be
attired:
these
are
holy
garments;
therefore
shall
he
wash
his
flesh
in
water,
and
so
put
them
on.
016:005
And
he
shall
take
of
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
two
kids
of
the
goats
for
a
sin
offering,
and
one
ram
for
a
burnt
offering.
016:006
And
Aaron
shall
offer
his
bullock
of
the
sin
offering,
which
is
for
himself,
and
make
an
atonement
for
himself,
and
for
his
house.
016:007
And
he
shall
take
the
two
goats,
and
present
them
before
the
LORD
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
016:008
And
Aaron
shall
cast
lots
upon
the
two
goats;
one
lot
for
the
LORD,
and
the
other
lot
for
the
scapegoat.
016:009
And
Aaron
shall
bring
the
goat
upon
which
the
LORD's
lot
fell,
and
offer
him
for
a
sin
offering.
016:010
But
the
goat,
on
which
the
lot
fell
to
be
the
scapegoat,
shall
be
presented
alive
before
the
LORD,
to
make
an
atonement
with
him,
and
to
let
him
go
for
a
scapegoat
into
the
wilderness.
016:011
And
Aaron
shall
bring
the
bullock
of
the
sin
offering,
which
is
for
himself,
and
shall
make
an
atonement
for
himself,
and
for
his
house,
and
shall
kill
the
bullock
of
the
sin
offering
which
is
for
himself:
016:012
And
he
shall
take
a
censer
full
of
burning
coals
of
fire
from
off
the
altar
before
the
LORD,
and
his
hands
full
of
sweet
incense
beaten
small,
and
bring
it
within
the
vail:
016:013
And
he
shall
put
the
incense
upon
the
fire
before
the
LORD,
that
the
cloud
of
the
incense
may
cover
the
mercy
seat
that
is
upon
the
testimony,
that
he
die
not:
016:014
And
he
shall
take
of
the
blood
of
the
bullock,
and
sprinkle
it
with
his
finger
upon
the
mercy
seat
eastward;
and
before
the
mercy
seat
shall
he
sprinkle
of
the
blood
with
his
finger
seven
times.
016:015
Then
shall
he
kill
the
goat
of
the
sin
offering,
that
is
for
the
people,
and
bring
his
blood
within
the
vail,
and
do
with
that
blood
as
he
did
with
the
blood
of
the
bullock,
and
sprinkle
it
upon
the
mercy
seat,
and
before
the
mercy
seat:
016:016
And
he
shall
make
an
atonement
for
the
holy
place,
because
of
the
uncleanness
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
because
of
their
transgressions
in
all
their
sins:
and
so
shall
he
do
for
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
that
remaineth
among
them
in
the
midst
of
their
uncleanness.
016:017
And
there
shall
be
no
man
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
when
he
goeth
in
to
make
an
atonement
in
the
holy
place,
until
he
come
out,
and
have
made
an
atonement
for
himself,
and
for
his
household,
and
for
all
the
congregation
of
Israel.
016:018
And
he
shall
go
out
unto
the
altar
that
is
before
the
LORD,
and
make
an
atonement
for
it;
and
shall
take
of
the
blood
of
the
bullock,
and
of
the
blood
of
the
goat,
and
put
it
upon
the
horns
of
the
altar
round
about.
016:019
And
he
shall
sprinkle
of
the
blood
upon
it
with
his
finger
seven
times,
and
cleanse
it,
and
hallow
it
from
the
uncleanness
of
the
children
of
Israel.
016:020
And
when
he
hath
made
an
end
of
reconciling
the
holy
place,
and
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
the
altar,
he
shall
bring
the
live
goat:
016:021
And
Aaron
shall
lay
both
his
hands
upon
the
head
of
the
live
goat,
and
confess
over
him
all
the
iniquities
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
all
their
transgressions
in
all
their
sins,
putting
them
upon
the
head
of
the
goat,
and
shall
send
him
away
by
the
hand
of
a
fit
man
into
the
wilderness:
016:022
And
the
goat
shall
bear
upon
him
all
their
iniquities
unto
a
land
not
inhabited:
and
he
shall
let
go
the
goat
in
the
wilderness.
016:023
And
Aaron
shall
come
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
shall
put
off
the
linen
garments,
which
he
put
on
when
he
went
into
the
holy
place,
and
shall
leave
them
there:
016:024
And
he
shall
wash
his
flesh
with
water
in
the
holy
place,
and
put
on
his
garments,
and
come
forth,
and
offer
his
burnt
offering,
and
the
burnt
offering
of
the
people,
and
make
an
atonement
for
himself,
and
for
the
people.
016:025
And
the
fat
of
the
sin
offering
shall
he
burn
upon
the
altar.
016:026
And
he
that
let
go
the
goat
for
the
scapegoat
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
his
flesh
in
water,
and
afterward
come
into
the
camp.
016:027
And
the
bullock
for
the
sin
offering,
and
the
goat
for
the
sin
offering,
whose
blood
was
brought
in
to
make
atonement
in
the
holy
place,
shall
one
carry
forth
without
the
camp;
and
they
shall
burn
in
the
fire
their
skins,
and
their
flesh,
and
their
dung.
016:028
And
he
that
burneth
them
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
his
flesh
in
water,
and
afterward
he
shall
come
into
the
camp.
016:029
And
this
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
unto
you:
that
in
the
seventh
month,
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month,
ye
shall
afflict
your
souls,
and
do
no
work
at
all,
whether
it
be
one
of
your
own
country,
or
a
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
you:
016:030
For
on
that
day
shall
the
priest
make
an
atonement
for
you,
to
cleanse
you,
that
ye
may
be
clean
from
all
your
sins
before
the
LORD.
016:031
It
shall
be
a
sabbath
of
rest
unto
you,
and
ye
shall
afflict
your
souls,
by
a
statute
for
ever.
016:032
And
the
priest,
whom
he
shall
anoint,
and
whom
he
shall
consecrate
to
minister
in
the
priest's
office
in
his
father's
stead,
shall
make
the
atonement,
and
shall
put
on
the
linen
clothes,
even
the
holy
garments:
016:033
And
he
shall
make
an
atonement
for
the
holy
sanctuary,
and
he
shall
make
an
atonement
for
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
for
the
altar,
and
he
shall
make
an
atonement
for
the
priests,
and
for
all
the
people
of
the
congregation.
016:034
And
this
shall
be
an
everlasting
statute
unto
you,
to
make
an
atonement
for
the
children
of
Israel
for
all
their
sins
once
a
year.
And
he
did
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
017:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
017:002
Speak
unto
Aaron,
and
unto
his
sons,
and
unto
all
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them;
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
hath
commanded,
saying,
017:003
What
man
soever
there
be
of
the
house
of
Israel,
that
killeth
an
ox,
or
lamb,
or
goat,
in
the
camp,
or
that
killeth
it
out
of
the
camp,
017:004
And
bringeth
it
not
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
to
offer
an
offering
unto
the
LORD
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD;
blood
shall
be
imputed
unto
that
man;
he
hath
shed
blood;
and
that
man
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people:
017:005
To
the
end
that
the
children
of
Israel
may
bring
their
sacrifices,
which
they
offer
in
the
open
field,
even
that
they
may
bring
them
unto
the
LORD,
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
unto
the
priest,
and
offer
them
for
peace
offerings
unto
the
LORD.
017:006
And
the
priest
shall
sprinkle
the
blood
upon
the
altar
of
the
LORD
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
burn
the
fat
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
017:007
And
they
shall
no
more
offer
their
sacrifices
unto
devils,
after
whom
they
have
gone
a
whoring.
This
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
unto
them
throughout
their
generations.
017:008
And
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
Whatsoever
man
there
be
of
the
house
of
Israel,
or
of
the
strangers
which
sojourn
among
you,
that
offereth
a
burnt
offering
or
sacrifice,
017:009
And
bringeth
it
not
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
to
offer
it
unto
the
LORD;
even
that
man
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people.
017:010
And
whatsoever
man
there
be
of
the
house
of
Israel,
or
of
the
strangers
that
sojourn
among
you,
that
eateth
any
manner
of
blood;
I
will
even
set
my
face
against
that
soul
that
eateth
blood,
and
will
cut
him
off
from
among
his
people.
017:011
For
the
life
of
the
flesh
is
in
the
blood:
and
I
have
given
it
to
you
upon
the
altar
to
make
an
atonement
for
your
souls:
for
it
is
the
blood
that
maketh
an
atonement
for
the
soul.
017:012
Therefore
I
said
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
No
soul
of
you
shall
eat
blood,
neither
shall
any
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
you
eat
blood.
017:013
And
whatsoever
man
there
be
of
the
children
of
Israel,
or
of
the
strangers
that
sojourn
among
you,
which
hunteth
and
catcheth
any
beast
or
fowl
that
may
be
eaten;
he
shall
even
pour
out
the
blood
thereof,
and
cover
it
with
dust.
017:014
For
it
is
the
life
of
all
flesh;
the
blood
of
it
is
for
the
life
thereof:
therefore
I
said
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
Ye
shall
eat
the
blood
of
no
manner
of
flesh:
for
the
life
of
all
flesh
is
the
blood
thereof:
whosoever
eateth
it
shall
be
cut
off.
017:015
And
every
soul
that
eateth
that
which
died
of
itself,
or
that
which
was
torn
with
beasts,
whether
it
be
one
of
your
own
country,
or
a
stranger,
he
shall
both
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even:
then
shall
he
be
clean.
017:016
But
if
he
wash
them
not,
nor
bathe
his
flesh;
then
he
shall
bear
his
iniquity.
018:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
018:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
018:003
After
the
doings
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
wherein
ye
dwelt,
shall
ye
not
do:
and
after
the
doings
of
the
land
of
Canaan,
whither
I
bring
you,
shall
ye
not
do:
neither
shall
ye
walk
in
their
ordinances.
018:004
Ye
shall
do
my
judgments,
and
keep
mine
ordinances,
to
walk
therein:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
018:005
Ye
shall
therefore
keep
my
statutes,
and
my
judgments:
which
if
a
man
do,
he
shall
live
in
them:
I
am
the
LORD.
018:006
None
of
you
shall
approach
to
any
that
is
near
of
kin
to
him,
to
uncover
their
nakedness:
I
am
the
LORD.
018:007
The
nakedness
of
thy
father,
or
the
nakedness
of
thy
mother,
shalt
thou
not
uncover:
she
is
thy
mother;
thou
shalt
not
uncover
her
nakedness.
018:008
The
nakedness
of
thy
father's
wife
shalt
thou
not
uncover:
it
is
thy
father's
nakedness.
018:009
The
nakedness
of
thy
sister,
the
daughter
of
thy
father,
or
daughter
of
thy
mother,
whether
she
be
born
at
home,
or
born
abroad,
even
their
nakedness
thou
shalt
not
uncover.
018:010
The
nakedness
of
thy
son's
daughter,
or
of
thy
daughter's
daughter,
even
their
nakedness
thou
shalt
not
uncover:
for
theirs
is
thine
own
nakedness.
018:011
The
nakedness
of
thy
father's
wife's
daughter,
begotten
of
thy
father,
she
is
thy
sister,
thou
shalt
not
uncover
her
nakedness.
018:012
Thou
shalt
not
uncover
the
nakedness
of
thy
father's
sister:
she
is
thy
father's
near
kinswoman.
018:013
Thou
shalt
not
uncover
the
nakedness
of
thy
mother's
sister:
for
she
is
thy
mother's
near
kinswoman.
018:014
Thou
shalt
not
uncover
the
nakedness
of
thy
father's
brother,
thou
shalt
not
approach
to
his
wife:
she
is
thine
aunt.
018:015
Thou
shalt
not
uncover
the
nakedness
of
thy
daughter
in
law:
she
is
thy
son's
wife;
thou
shalt
not
uncover
her
nakedness.
018:016
Thou
shalt
not
uncover
the
nakedness
of
thy
brother's
wife:
it
is
thy
brother's
nakedness.
018:017
Thou
shalt
not
uncover
the
nakedness
of
a
woman
and
her
daughter,
neither
shalt
thou
take
her
son's
daughter,
or
her
daughter's
daughter,
to
uncover
her
nakedness;
for
they
are
her
near
kinswomen:
it
is
wickedness.
018:018
Neither
shalt
thou
take
a
wife
to
her
sister,
to
vex
her,
to
uncover
her
nakedness,
beside
the
other
in
her
life
time.
018:019
Also
thou
shalt
not
approach
unto
a
woman
to
uncover
her
nakedness,
as
long
as
she
is
put
apart
for
her
uncleanness.
018:020
Moreover
thou
shalt
not
lie
carnally
with
thy
neighbour's
wife,
to
defile
thyself
with
her.
018:021
And
thou
shalt
not
let
any
of
thy
seed
pass
through
the
fire
to
Molech,
neither
shalt
thou
profane
the
name
of
thy
God:
I
am
the
LORD.
018:022
Thou
shalt
not
lie
with
mankind,
as
with
womankind:
it
is
abomination.
018:023
Neither
shalt
thou
lie
with
any
beast
to
defile
thyself
therewith:
neither
shall
any
woman
stand
before
a
beast
to
lie
down
thereto:
it
is
confusion.
018:024
Defile
not
ye
yourselves
in
any
of
these
things:
for
in
all
these
the
nations
are
defiled
which
I
cast
out
