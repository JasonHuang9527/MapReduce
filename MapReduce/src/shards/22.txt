before
you:
018:025
And
the
land
is
defiled:
therefore
I
do
visit
the
iniquity
thereof
upon
it,
and
the
land
itself
vomiteth
out
her
inhabitants.
018:026
Ye
shall
therefore
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgments,
and
shall
not
commit
any
of
these
abominations;
neither
any
of
your
own
nation,
nor
any
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
you:
018:027
(For
all
these
abominations
have
the
men
of
the
land
done,
which
were
before
you,
and
the
land
is
defiled;)
018:028
That
the
land
spue
not
you
out
also,
when
ye
defile
it,
as
it
spued
out
the
nations
that
were
before
you.
018:029
For
whosoever
shall
commit
any
of
these
abominations,
even
the
souls
that
commit
them
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
their
people.
018:030
Therefore
shall
ye
keep
mine
ordinance,
that
ye
commit
not
any
one
of
these
abominable
customs,
which
were
committed
before
you,
and
that
ye
defile
not
yourselves
therein:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
019:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
019:002
Speak
unto
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
Ye
shall
be
holy:
for
I
the
LORD
your
God
am
holy.
019:003
Ye
shall
fear
every
man
his
mother,
and
his
father,
and
keep
my
sabbaths:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
019:004
Turn
ye
not
unto
idols,
nor
make
to
yourselves
molten
gods:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
019:005
And
if
ye
offer
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings
unto
the
LORD,
ye
shall
offer
it
at
your
own
will.
019:006
It
shall
be
eaten
the
same
day
ye
offer
it,
and
on
the
morrow:
and
if
ought
remain
until
the
third
day,
it
shall
be
burnt
in
the
fire.
019:007
And
if
it
be
eaten
at
all
on
the
third
day,
it
is
abominable;
it
shall
not
be
accepted.
019:008
Therefore
every
one
that
eateth
it
shall
bear
his
iniquity,
because
he
hath
profaned
the
hallowed
thing
of
the
LORD:
and
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people.
019:009
And
when
ye
reap
the
harvest
of
your
land,
thou
shalt
not
wholly
reap
the
corners
of
thy
field,
neither
shalt
thou
gather
the
gleanings
of
thy
harvest.
019:010
And
thou
shalt
not
glean
thy
vineyard,
neither
shalt
thou
gather
every
grape
of
thy
vineyard;
thou
shalt
leave
them
for
the
poor
and
stranger:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
019:011
Ye
shall
not
steal,
neither
deal
falsely,
neither
lie
one
to
another.
019:012
And
ye
shall
not
swear
by
my
name
falsely,
neither
shalt
thou
profane
the
name
of
thy
God:
I
am
the
LORD.
019:013
Thou
shalt
not
defraud
thy
neighbour,
neither
rob
him:
the
wages
of
him
that
is
hired
shall
not
abide
with
thee
all
night
until
the
morning.
019:014
Thou
shalt
not
curse
the
deaf,
nor
put
a
stumblingblock
before
the
blind,
but
shalt
fear
thy
God:
I
am
the
LORD.
019:015
Ye
shall
do
no
unrighteousness
in
judgment:
thou
shalt
not
respect
the
person
of
the
poor,
nor
honor
the
person
of
the
mighty:
but
in
righteousness
shalt
thou
judge
thy
neighbour.
019:016
Thou
shalt
not
go
up
and
down
as
a
talebearer
among
thy
people:
neither
shalt
thou
stand
against
the
blood
of
thy
neighbour;
I
am
the
LORD.
019:017
Thou
shalt
not
hate
thy
brother
in
thine
heart:
thou
shalt
in
any
wise
rebuke
thy
neighbour,
and
not
suffer
sin
upon
him.
019:018
Thou
shalt
not
avenge,
nor
bear
any
grudge
against
the
children
of
thy
people,
but
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself:
I
am
the
LORD.
019:019
Ye
shall
keep
my
statutes.
Thou
shalt
not
let
thy
cattle
gender
with
a
diverse
kind:
thou
shalt
not
sow
thy
field
with
mingled
seed:
neither
shall
a
garment
mingled
of
linen
and
woollen
come
upon
thee.
019:020
And
whosoever
lieth
carnally
with
a
woman,
that
is
a
bondmaid,
betrothed
to
an
husband,
and
not
at
all
redeemed,
nor
freedom
given
her;
she
shall
be
scourged;
they
shall
not
be
put
to
death,
because
she
was
not
free.
019:021
And
he
shall
bring
his
trespass
offering
unto
the
LORD,
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
even
a
ram
for
a
trespass
offering.
019:022
And
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
him
with
the
ram
of
the
trespass
offering
before
the
LORD
for
his
sin
which
he
hath
done:
and
the
sin
which
he
hath
done
shall
be
forgiven
him.
019:023
And
when
ye
shall
come
into
the
land,
and
shall
have
planted
all
manner
of
trees
for
food,
then
ye
shall
count
the
fruit
thereof
as
uncircumcised:
three
years
shall
it
be
as
uncircumcised
unto
you:
it
shall
not
be
eaten
of.
019:024
But
in
the
fourth
year
all
the
fruit
thereof
shall
be
holy
to
praise
the
LORD
withal.
019:025
And
in
the
fifth
year
shall
ye
eat
of
the
fruit
thereof,
that
it
may
yield
unto
you
the
increase
thereof:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
019:026
Ye
shall
not
eat
any
thing
with
the
blood:
neither
shall
ye
use
enchantment,
nor
observe
times.
019:027
Ye
shall
not
round
the
corners
of
your
heads,
neither
shalt
thou
mar
the
corners
of
thy
beard.
019:028
Ye
shall
not
make
any
cuttings
in
your
flesh
for
the
dead,
nor
print
any
marks
upon
you:
I
am
the
LORD.
019:029
Do
not
prostitute
thy
daughter,
to
cause
her
to
be
a
whore;
lest
the
land
fall
to
whoredom,
and
the
land
become
full
of
wickedness.
019:030
Ye
shall
keep
my
sabbaths,
and
reverence
my
sanctuary:
I
am
the
LORD.
019:031
Regard
not
them
that
have
familiar
spirits,
neither
seek
after
wizards,
to
be
defiled
by
them:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
019:032
Thou
shalt
rise
up
before
the
hoary
head,
and
honour
the
face
of
the
old
man,
and
fear
thy
God:
I
am
the
LORD.
019:033
And
if
a
stranger
sojourn
with
thee
in
your
land,
ye
shall
not
vex
him.
019:034
But
the
stranger
that
dwelleth
with
you
shall
be
unto
you
as
one
born
among
you,
and
thou
shalt
love
him
as
thyself;
for
ye
were
strangers
in
the
land
of
Egypt:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
019:035
Ye
shall
do
no
unrighteousness
in
judgment,
in
meteyard,
in
weight,
or
in
measure.
019:036
Just
balances,
just
weights,
a
just
ephah,
and
a
just
hin,
shall
ye
have:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God,
which
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
019:037
Therefore
shall
ye
observe
all
my
statutes,
and
all
my
judgments,
and
do
them:
I
am
the
LORD.
020:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
020:002
Again,
thou
shalt
say
to
the
children
of
Israel,
Whosoever
he
be
of
the
children
of
Israel,
or
of
the
strangers
that
sojourn
in
Israel,
that
giveth
any
of
his
seed
unto
Molech;
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death:
the
people
of
the
land
shall
stone
him
with
stones.
020:003
And
I
will
set
my
face
against
that
man,
and
will
cut
him
off
from
among
his
people;
because
he
hath
given
of
his
seed
unto
Molech,
to
defile
my
sanctuary,
and
to
profane
my
holy
name.
020:004
And
if
the
people
of
the
land
do
any
ways
hide
their
eyes
from
the
man,
when
he
giveth
of
his
seed
unto
Molech,
and
kill
him
not:
020:005
Then
I
will
set
my
face
against
that
man,
and
against
his
family,
and
will
cut
him
off,
and
all
that
go
a
whoring
after
him,
to
commit
whoredom
with
Molech,
from
among
their
people.
020:006
And
the
soul
that
turneth
after
such
as
have
familiar
spirits,
and
after
wizards,
to
go
a
whoring
after
them,
I
will
even
set
my
face
against
that
soul,
and
will
cut
him
off
from
among
his
people.
020:007
Sanctify
yourselves
therefore,
and
be
ye
holy:
for
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
020:008
And
ye
shall
keep
my
statutes,
and
do
them:
I
am
the
LORD
which
sanctify
you.
020:009
For
every
one
that
curseth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
be
surely
put
to
death:
he
hath
cursed
his
father
or
his
mother;
his
blood
shall
be
upon
him.
020:010
And
the
man
that
committeth
adultery
with
another
man's
wife,
even
he
that
committeth
adultery
with
his
neighbour's
wife,
the
adulterer
and
the
adulteress
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
020:011
And
the
man
that
lieth
with
his
father's
wife
hath
uncovered
his
father's
nakedness:
both
of
them
shall
surely
be
put
to
death;
their
blood
shall
be
upon
them.
020:012
And
if
a
man
lie
with
his
daughter
in
law,
both
of
them
shall
surely
be
put
to
death:
they
have
wrought
confusion;
their
blood
shall
be
upon
them.
020:013
If
a
man
also
lie
with
mankind,
as
he
lieth
with
a
woman,
both
of
them
have
committed
an
abomination:
they
shall
surely
be
put
to
death;
their
blood
shall
be
upon
them.
020:014
And
if
a
man
take
a
wife
and
her
mother,
it
is
wickedness:
they
shall
be
burnt
with
fire,
both
he
and
they;
that
there
be
no
wickedness
among
you.
020:015
And
if
a
man
lie
with
a
beast,
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death:
and
ye
shall
slay
the
beast.
020:016
And
if
a
woman
approach
unto
any
beast,
and
lie
down
thereto,
thou
shalt
kill
the
woman,
and
the
beast:
they
shall
surely
be
put
to
death;
their
blood
shall
be
upon
them.
020:017
And
if
a
man
shall
take
his
sister,
his
father's
daughter,
or
his
mother's
daughter,
and
see
her
nakedness,
and
she
see
his
nakedness;
it
is
a
wicked
thing;
and
they
shall
be
cut
off
in
the
sight
of
their
people:
he
hath
uncovered
his
sister's
nakedness;
he
shall
bear
his
iniquity.
020:018
And
if
a
man
shall
lie
with
a
woman
having
her
sickness,
and
shall
uncover
her
nakedness;
he
hath
discovered
her
fountain,
and
she
hath
uncovered
the
fountain
of
her
blood:
and
both
of
them
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
their
people.
020:019
And
thou
shalt
not
uncover
the
nakedness
of
thy
mother's
sister,
nor
of
thy
father's
sister:
for
he
uncovereth
his
near
kin:
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity.
020:020
And
if
a
man
shall
lie
with
his
uncle's
wife,
he
hath
uncovered
his
uncle's
nakedness:
they
shall
bear
their
sin;
they
shall
die
childless.
020:021
And
if
a
man
shall
take
his
brother's
wife,
it
is
an
unclean
thing:
he
hath
uncovered
his
brother's
nakedness;
they
shall
be
childless.
020:022
Ye
shall
therefore
keep
all
my
statutes,
and
all
my
judgments,
and
do
them:
that
the
land,
whither
I
bring
you
to
dwell
therein,
spue
you
not
out.
020:023
And
ye
shall
not
walk
in
the
manners
of
the
nation,
which
I
cast
out
before
you:
for
they
committed
all
these
things,
and
therefore
I
abhorred
them.
020:024
But
I
have
said
unto
you,
Ye
shall
inherit
their
land,
and
I
will
give
it
unto
you
to
possess
it,
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God,
which
have
separated
you
from
other
people.
020:025
Ye
shall
therefore
put
difference
between
clean
beasts
and
unclean,
and
between
unclean
fowls
and
clean:
and
ye
shall
not
make
your
souls
abominable
by
beast,
or
by
fowl,
or
by
any
manner
of
living
thing
that
creepeth
on
the
ground,
which
I
have
separated
from
you
as
unclean.
020:026
And
ye
shall
be
holy
unto
me:
for
I
the
LORD
am
holy,
and
have
severed
you
from
other
people,
that
ye
should
be
mine.
020:027
A
man
also
or
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit,
or
that
is
a
wizard,
shall
surely
be
put
to
death:
they
shall
stone
them
with
stones:
their
blood
shall
be
upon
them.
021:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Speak
unto
the
priests
the
sons
of
Aaron,
and
say
unto
them,
There
shall
none
be
defiled
for
the
dead
among
his
people:
021:002
But
for
his
kin,
that
is
near
unto
him,
that
is,
for
his
mother,
and
for
his
father,
and
for
his
son,
and
for
his
daughter,
and
for
his
brother.
021:003
And
for
his
sister
a
virgin,
that
is
nigh
unto
him,
which
hath
had
no
husband;
for
her
may
he
be
defiled.
021:004
But
he
shall
not
defile
himself,
being
a
chief
man
among
his
people,
to
profane
himself.
021:005
They
shall
not
make
baldness
upon
their
head,
neither
shall
they
shave
off
the
corner
of
their
beard,
nor
make
any
cuttings
in
their
flesh.
021:006
They
shall
be
holy
unto
their
God,
and
not
profane
the
name
of
their
God:
for
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire,
and
the
bread
of
their
God,
they
do
offer:
therefore
they
shall
be
holy.
021:007
They
shall
not
take
a
wife
that
is
a
whore,
or
profane;
neither
shall
they
take
a
woman
put
away
from
her
husband:
for
he
is
holy
unto
his
God.
021:008
Thou
shalt
sanctify
him
therefore;
for
he
offereth
the
bread
of
thy
God:
he
shall
be
holy
unto
thee:
for
I
the
LORD,
which
sanctify
you,
am
holy.
021:009
And
the
daughter
of
any
priest,
if
she
profane
herself
by
playing
the
whore,
she
profaneth
her
father:
she
shall
be
burnt
with
fire.
021:010
And
he
that
is
the
high
priest
among
his
brethren,
upon
whose
head
the
anointing
oil
was
poured,
and
that
is
consecrated
to
put
on
the
garments,
shall
not
uncover
his
head,
nor
rend
his
clothes;
021:011
Neither
shall
he
go
in
to
any
dead
body,
nor
defile
himself
for
his
father,
or
for
his
mother;
021:012
Neither
shall
he
go
out
of
the
sanctuary,
nor
profane
the
sanctuary
of
his
God;
for
the
crown
of
the
anointing
oil
of
his
God
is
upon
him:
I
am
the
LORD.
021:013
And
he
shall
take
a
wife
in
her
virginity.
021:014
A
widow,
or
a
divorced
woman,
or
profane,
or
an
harlot,
these
shall
he
not
take:
but
he
shall
take
a
virgin
of
his
own
people
to
wife.
021:015
Neither
shall
he
profane
his
seed
among
his
people:
for
I
the
LORD
do
sanctify
him.
021:016
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
021:017
Speak
unto
Aaron,
saying,
Whosoever
he
be
of
thy
seed
in
their
generations
that
hath
any
blemish,
let
him
not
approach
to
offer
the
bread
of
his
God.
021:018
For
whatsoever
man
he
be
that
hath
a
blemish,
he
shall
not
approach:
a
blind
man,
or
a
lame,
or
he
that
hath
a
flat
nose,
or
any
thing
superfluous,
021:019
Or
a
man
that
is
brokenfooted,
or
brokenhanded,
021:020
Or
crookbackt,
or
a
dwarf,
or
that
hath
a
blemish
in
his
eye,
or
be
scurvy,
or
scabbed,
or
hath
his
stones
broken;
021:021
No
man
that
hath
a
blemish
of
the
seed
of
Aaron
the
priest
shall
come
nigh
to
offer
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire:
he
hath
a
blemish;
he
shall
not
come
nigh
to
offer
the
bread
of
his
God.
021:022
He
shall
eat
the
bread
of
his
God,
both
of
the
most
holy,
and
of
the
holy.
021:023
Only
he
shall
not
go
in
unto
the
vail,
nor
come
nigh
unto
the
altar,
because
he
hath
a
blemish;
that
he
profane
not
my
sanctuaries:
for
I
the
LORD
do
sanctify
them.
021:024
And
Moses
told
it
unto
Aaron,
and
to
his
sons,
and
unto
all
the
children
of
Israel.
022:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
022:002
Speak
unto
Aaron
and
to
his
sons,
that
they
separate
themselves
from
the
holy
things
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
that
they
profane
not
my
holy
name
in
those
things
which
they
hallow
unto
me:
I
am
the
LORD.
022:003
Say
unto
them,
Whosoever
he
be
of
all
your
seed
among
your
generations,
that
goeth
unto
the
holy
things,
which
the
children
of
Israel
hallow
unto
the
LORD,
having
his
uncleanness
upon
him,
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
my
presence:
I
am
the
LORD.
022:004
What
man
soever
of
the
seed
of
Aaron
is
a
leper,
or
hath
a
running
issue;
he
shall
not
eat
of
the
holy
things,
until
he
be
clean.
And
whoso
toucheth
any
thing
that
is
unclean
by
the
dead,
or
a
man
whose
seed
goeth
from
him;
022:005
Or
whosoever
toucheth
any
creeping
thing,
whereby
he
may
be
made
unclean,
or
a
man
of
whom
he
may
take
uncleanness,
whatsoever
uncleanness
he
hath;
022:006
The
soul
which
hath
touched
any
such
shall
be
unclean
until
even,
and
shall
not
eat
of
the
holy
things,
unless
he
wash
his
flesh
with
water.
022:007
And
when
the
sun
is
down,
he
shall
be
clean,
and
shall
afterward
eat
of
the
holy
things;
because
it
is
his
food.
022:008
That
which
dieth
of
itself,
or
is
torn
with
beasts,
he
shall
not
eat
to
defile
himself
therewith;
I
am
the
LORD.
022:009
They
shall
therefore
keep
mine
ordinance,
lest
they
bear
sin
for
it,
and
die
therefore,
if
they
profane
it:
I
the
LORD
do
sanctify
them.
022:010
There
shall
no
stranger
eat
of
the
holy
thing:
a
sojourner
of
the
priest,
or
an
hired
servant,
shall
not
eat
of
the
holy
thing.
022:011
But
if
the
priest
buy
any
soul
with
his
money,
he
shall
eat
of
it,
and
he
that
is
born
in
his
house:
they
shall
eat
of
his
meat.
022:012
If
the
priest's
daughter
also
be
married
unto
a
stranger,
she
may
not
eat
of
an
offering
of
the
holy
things.
022:013
But
if
the
priest's
daughter
be
a
widow,
or
divorced,
and
have
no
child,
and
is
returned
unto
her
father's
house,
as
in
her
youth,
she
shall
eat
of
her
father's
meat:
but
there
shall
be
no
stranger
eat
thereof.
022:014
And
if
a
man
eat
of
the
holy
thing
unwittingly,
then
he
shall
put
the
fifth
part
thereof
unto
it,
and
shall
give
it
unto
the
priest
with
the
holy
thing.
022:015
And
they
shall
not
profane
the
holy
things
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
they
offer
unto
the
LORD;
022:016
Or
suffer
them
to
bear
the
iniquity
of
trespass,
when
they
eat
their
holy
things:
for
I
the
LORD
do
sanctify
them.
022:017
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
022:018
Speak
unto
Aaron,
and
to
his
sons,
and
unto
all
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
Whatsoever
he
be
of
the
house
of
Israel,
or
of
the
strangers
in
Israel,
that
will
offer
his
oblation
for
all
his
vows,
and
for
all
his
freewill
offerings,
which
they
will
offer
unto
the
LORD
for
a
burnt
offering;
022:019
Ye
shall
offer
at
your
own
will
a
male
without
blemish,
of
the
beeves,
of
the
sheep,
or
of
the
goats.
022:020
But
whatsoever
hath
a
blemish,
that
shall
ye
not
offer:
for
it
shall
not
be
acceptable
for
you.
022:021
And
whosoever
offereth
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings
unto
the
LORD
to
accomplish
his
vow,
or
a
freewill
offering
in
beeves
or
sheep,
it
shall
be
perfect
to
be
accepted;
there
shall
be
no
blemish
therein.
022:022
Blind,
or
broken,
or
maimed,
or
having
a
wen,
or
scurvy,
or
scabbed,
ye
shall
not
offer
these
unto
the
LORD,
nor
make
an
offering
by
fire
of
them
upon
the
altar
unto
the
LORD.
022:023
Either
a
bullock
or
a
lamb
that
hath
any
thing
superfluous
or
lacking
in
his
parts,
that
mayest
thou
offer
for
a
freewill
offering;
but
for
a
vow
it
shall
not
be
accepted.
022:024
Ye
shall
not
offer
unto
the
LORD
that
which
is
bruised,
or
crushed,
or
broken,
or
cut;
neither
shall
ye
make
any
offering
thereof
in
your
land.
022:025
Neither
from
a
stranger's
hand
shall
ye
offer
the
bread
of
your
God
of
any
of
these;
because
their
corruption
is
in
them,
and
blemishes
be
in
them:
they
shall
not
be
accepted
for
you.
022:026
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
022:027
When
a
bullock,
or
a
sheep,
or
a
goat,
is
brought
forth,
then
it
shall
be
seven
days
under
the
dam;
and
from
the
eighth
day
and
thenceforth
it
shall
be
accepted
for
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
022:028
And
whether
it
be
cow,
or
ewe,
ye
shall
not
kill
it
and
her
young
both
in
one
day.
022:029
And
when
ye
will
offer
a
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving
unto
the
LORD,
offer
it
at
your
own
will.
022:030
On
the
same
day
it
shall
be
eaten
up;
ye
shall
leave
none
of
it
until
the
morrow:
I
am
the
LORD.
022:031
Therefore
shall
ye
keep
my
commandments,
and
do
them:
I
am
the
LORD.
022:032
Neither
shall
ye
profane
my
holy
name;
but
I
will
be
hallowed
among
the
children
of
Israel:
I
am
the
LORD
which
hallow
you,
022:033
That
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
to
be
your
God:
I
am
the
LORD.
023:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
023:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
Concerning
the
feasts
of
the
LORD,
which
ye
shall
proclaim
to
be
holy
convocations,
even
these
are
my
feasts.
023:003
Six
days
shall
work
be
done:
but
the
seventh
day
is
the
sabbath
of
rest,
an
holy
convocation;
ye
shall
do
no
work
therein:
it
is
the
sabbath
of
the
LORD
in
all
your
dwellings.
023:004
These
are
the
feasts
of
the
LORD,
even
holy
convocations,
which
ye
shall
proclaim
in
their
seasons.
023:005
In
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
first
month
at
even
is
the
LORD's
passover.
023:006
And
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
same
month
is
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
unto
the
LORD:
seven
days
ye
must
eat
unleavened
bread.
023:007
In
the
first
day
ye
shall
have
an
holy
convocation:
ye
shall
do
no
servile
work
therein.
023:008
But
ye
shall
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD
seven
days:
in
the
seventh
day
is
an
holy
convocation:
ye
shall
do
no
servile
work
therein.
023:009
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
023:010
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
ye
be
come
into
the
land
which
I
give
unto
you,
and
shall
reap
the
harvest
thereof,
then
ye
shall
bring
a
sheaf
of
the
firstfruits
of
your
harvest
unto
the
priest:
023:011
And
he
shall
wave
the
sheaf
before
the
LORD,
to
be
accepted
for
you:
on
the
morrow
after
the
sabbath
the
priest
shall
wave
it.
023:012
And
ye
shall
offer
that
day
when
ye
wave
the
sheaf
an
he
lamb
without
blemish
of
the
first
year
for
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
LORD.
023:013
And
the
meat
offering
thereof
shall
be
two
tenth
deals
of
fine
flour
mingled
with
oil,
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD
for
a
sweet
savour:
and
the
drink
offering
thereof
shall
be
of
wine,
the
fourth
part
of
an
hin.
023:014
And
ye
shall
eat
neither
bread,
nor
parched
corn,
nor
green
ears,
until
the
selfsame
day
that
ye
have
brought
an
offering
unto
your
God:
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
throughout
your
generations
in
all
your
dwellings.
023:015
And
ye
shall
count
unto
you
from
the
morrow
after
the
sabbath,
from
the
day
that
ye
brought
the
sheaf
of
the
wave
offering;
seven
sabbaths
shall
be
complete:
023:016
Even
unto
the
morrow
after
the
seventh
sabbath
shall
ye
number
fifty
days;
and
ye
shall
offer
a
new
meat
offering
unto
the
LORD.
023:017
Ye
shall
bring
out
of
your
habitations
two
wave
loaves
of
two
tenth
deals;
they
shall
be
of
fine
flour;
they
shall
be
baken
with
leaven;
they
are
the
firstfruits
unto
the
LORD.
023:018
And
ye
shall
offer
with
the
bread
seven
lambs
without
blemish
of
the
first
year,
and
one
young
bullock,
and
two
rams:
they
shall
be
for
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
LORD,
with
their
meat
offering,
and
their
drink
offerings,
even
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
023:019
Then
ye
shall
sacrifice
one
kid
of
the
goats
for
a
sin
offering,
and
two
lambs
of
the
first
year
for
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings.
023:020
And
the
priest
shall
wave
them
with
the
bread
of
the
firstfruits
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD,
with
the
two
lambs:
they
shall
be
holy
to
the
LORD
for
the
priest.
023:021
And
ye
shall
proclaim
on
the
selfsame
day,
that
it
may
be
an
holy
convocation
unto
you:
ye
shall
do
no
servile
work
therein:
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
in
all
your
dwellings
throughout
your
generations.
023:022
And
when
