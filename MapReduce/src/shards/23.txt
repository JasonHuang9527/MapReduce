ye
reap
the
harvest
of
your
land,
thou
shalt
not
make
clean
riddance
of
the
corners
of
thy
field
when
thou
reapest,
neither
shalt
thou
gather
any
gleaning
of
thy
harvest:
thou
shalt
leave
them
unto
the
poor,
and
to
the
stranger:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
023:023
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
023:024
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
In
the
seventh
month,
in
the
first
day
of
the
month,
shall
ye
have
a
sabbath,
a
memorial
of
blowing
of
trumpets,
an
holy
convocation.
023:025
Ye
shall
do
no
servile
work
therein:
but
ye
shall
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
023:026
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
023:027
Also
on
the
tenth
day
of
this
seventh
month
there
shall
be
a
day
of
atonement:
it
shall
be
an
holy
convocation
unto
you;
and
ye
shall
afflict
your
souls,
and
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
023:028
And
ye
shall
do
no
work
in
that
same
day:
for
it
is
a
day
of
atonement,
to
make
an
atonement
for
you
before
the
LORD
your
God.
023:029
For
whatsoever
soul
it
be
that
shall
not
be
afflicted
in
that
same
day,
he
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people.
023:030
And
whatsoever
soul
it
be
that
doeth
any
work
in
that
same
day,
the
same
soul
will
I
destroy
from
among
his
people.
023:031
Ye
shall
do
no
manner
of
work:
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
throughout
your
generations
in
all
your
dwellings.
023:032
It
shall
be
unto
you
a
sabbath
of
rest,
and
ye
shall
afflict
your
souls:
in
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
at
even,
from
even
unto
even,
shall
ye
celebrate
your
sabbath.
023:033
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
023:034
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
The
fifteenth
day
of
this
seventh
month
shall
be
the
feast
of
tabernacles
for
seven
days
unto
the
LORD.
023:035
On
the
first
day
shall
be
an
holy
convocation:
ye
shall
do
no
servile
work
therein.
023:036
Seven
days
ye
shall
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD:
on
the
eighth
day
shall
be
an
holy
convocation
unto
you;
and
ye
shall
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD:
it
is
a
solemn
assembly;
and
ye
shall
do
no
servile
work
therein.
023:037
These
are
the
feasts
of
the
LORD,
which
ye
shall
proclaim
to
be
holy
convocations,
to
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD,
a
burnt
offering,
and
a
meat
offering,
a
sacrifice,
and
drink
offerings,
every
thing
upon
his
day:
023:038
Beside
the
sabbaths
of
the
LORD,
and
beside
your
gifts,
and
beside
all
your
vows,
and
beside
all
your
freewill
offerings,
which
ye
give
unto
the
LORD.
023:039
Also
in
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
seventh
month,
when
ye
have
gathered
in
the
fruit
of
the
land,
ye
shall
keep
a
feast
unto
the
LORD
seven
days:
on
the
first
day
shall
be
a
sabbath,
and
on
the
eighth
day
shall
be
a
sabbath.
023:040
And
ye
shall
take
you
on
the
first
day
the
boughs
of
goodly
trees,
branches
of
palm
trees,
and
the
boughs
of
thick
trees,
and
willows
of
the
brook;
and
ye
shall
rejoice
before
the
LORD
your
God
seven
days.
023:041
And
ye
shall
keep
it
a
feast
unto
the
LORD
seven
days
in
the
year.
It
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
in
your
generations:
ye
shall
celebrate
it
in
the
seventh
month.
023:042
Ye
shall
dwell
in
booths
seven
days;
all
that
are
Israelites
born
shall
dwell
in
booths:
023:043
That
your
generations
may
know
that
I
made
the
children
of
Israel
to
dwell
in
booths,
when
I
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
023:044
And
Moses
declared
unto
the
children
of
Israel
the
feasts
of
the
LORD.
024:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
024:002
Command
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
bring
unto
thee
pure
oil
olive
beaten
for
the
light,
to
cause
the
lamps
to
burn
continually.
024:003
Without
the
vail
of
the
testimony,
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
shall
Aaron
order
it
from
the
evening
unto
the
morning
before
the
LORD
continually:
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
in
your
generations.
024:004
He
shall
order
the
lamps
upon
the
pure
candlestick
before
the
LORD
continually.
024:005
And
thou
shalt
take
fine
flour,
and
bake
twelve
cakes
thereof:
two
tenth
deals
shall
be
in
one
cake.
024:006
And
thou
shalt
set
them
in
two
rows,
six
on
a
row,
upon
the
pure
table
before
the
LORD.
024:007
And
thou
shalt
put
pure
frankincense
upon
each
row,
that
it
may
be
on
the
bread
for
a
memorial,
even
an
offering
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
024:008
Every
sabbath
he
shall
set
it
in
order
before
the
LORD
continually,
being
taken
from
the
children
of
Israel
by
an
everlasting
covenant.
024:009
And
it
shall
be
Aaron's
and
his
sons';
and
they
shall
eat
it
in
the
holy
place:
for
it
is
most
holy
unto
him
of
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire
by
a
perpetual
statute.
024:010
And
the
son
of
an
Israelitish
woman,
whose
father
was
an
Egyptian,
went
out
among
the
children
of
Israel:
and
this
son
of
the
Israelitish
woman
and
a
man
of
Israel
strove
together
in
the
camp;
024:011
And
the
Israelitish
woman's
son
blasphemed
the
name
of
the
Lord,
and
cursed.
And
they
brought
him
unto
Moses:
(and
his
mother's
name
was
Shelomith,
the
daughter
of
Dibri,
of
the
tribe
of
Dan:)
024:012
And
they
put
him
in
ward,
that
the
mind
of
the
LORD
might
be
shewed
them.
024:013
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
024:014
Bring
forth
him
that
hath
cursed
without
the
camp;
and
let
all
that
heard
him
lay
their
hands
upon
his
head,
and
let
all
the
congregation
stone
him.
024:015
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
Whosoever
curseth
his
God
shall
bear
his
sin.
024:016
And
he
that
blasphemeth
the
name
of
the
LORD,
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death,
and
all
the
congregation
shall
certainly
stone
him:
as
well
the
stranger,
as
he
that
is
born
in
the
land,
when
he
blasphemeth
the
name
of
the
Lord,
shall
be
put
to
death.
024:017
And
he
that
killeth
any
man
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
024:018
And
he
that
killeth
a
beast
shall
make
it
good;
beast
for
beast.
024:019
And
if
a
man
cause
a
blemish
in
his
neighbour;
as
he
hath
done,
so
shall
it
be
done
to
him;
024:020
Breach
for
breach,
eye
for
eye,
tooth
for
tooth:
as
he
hath
caused
a
blemish
in
a
man,
so
shall
it
be
done
to
him
again.
024:021
And
he
that
killeth
a
beast,
he
shall
restore
it:
and
he
that
killeth
a
man,
he
shall
be
put
to
death.
024:022
Ye
shall
have
one
manner
of
law,
as
well
for
the
stranger,
as
for
one
of
your
own
country:
for
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
024:023
And
Moses
spake
to
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
should
bring
forth
him
that
had
cursed
out
of
the
camp,
and
stone
him
with
stones.
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
025:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
in
mount
Sinai,
saying,
025:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
ye
come
into
the
land
which
I
give
you,
then
shall
the
land
keep
a
sabbath
unto
the
LORD.
025:003
Six
years
thou
shalt
sow
thy
field,
and
six
years
thou
shalt
prune
thy
vineyard,
and
gather
in
the
fruit
thereof;
025:004
But
in
the
seventh
year
shall
be
a
sabbath
of
rest
unto
the
land,
a
sabbath
for
the
LORD:
thou
shalt
neither
sow
thy
field,
nor
prune
thy
vineyard.
025:005
That
which
groweth
of
its
own
accord
of
thy
harvest
thou
shalt
not
reap,
neither
gather
the
grapes
of
thy
vine
undressed:
for
it
is
a
year
of
rest
unto
the
land.
025:006
And
the
sabbath
of
the
land
shall
be
meat
for
you;
for
thee,
and
for
thy
servant,
and
for
thy
maid,
and
for
thy
hired
servant,
and
for
thy
stranger
that
sojourneth
with
thee.
025:007
And
for
thy
cattle,
and
for
the
beast
that
are
in
thy
land,
shall
all
the
increase
thereof
be
meat.
025:008
And
thou
shalt
number
seven
sabbaths
of
years
unto
thee,
seven
times
seven
years;
and
the
space
of
the
seven
sabbaths
of
years
shall
be
unto
thee
forty
and
nine
years.
025:009
Then
shalt
thou
cause
the
trumpet
of
the
jubile
to
sound
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
seventh
month,
in
the
day
of
atonement
shall
ye
make
the
trumpet
sound
throughout
all
your
land.
025:010
And
ye
shall
hallow
the
fiftieth
year,
and
proclaim
liberty
throughout
all
the
land
unto
all
the
inhabitants
thereof:
it
shall
be
a
jubile
unto
you;
and
ye
shall
return
every
man
unto
his
possession,
and
ye
shall
return
every
man
unto
his
family.
025:011
A
jubile
shall
that
fiftieth
year
be
unto
you:
ye
shall
not
sow,
neither
reap
that
which
groweth
of
itself
in
it,
nor
gather
the
grapes
in
it
of
thy
vine
undressed.
025:012
For
it
is
the
jubile;
it
shall
be
holy
unto
you:
ye
shall
eat
the
increase
thereof
out
of
the
field.
025:013
In
the
year
of
this
jubile
ye
shall
return
every
man
unto
his
possession.
025:014
And
if
thou
sell
ought
unto
thy
neighbour,
or
buyest
ought
of
thy
neighbour's
hand,
ye
shall
not
oppress
one
another:
025:015
According
to
the
number
of
years
after
the
jubile
thou
shalt
buy
of
thy
neighbour,
and
according
unto
the
number
of
years
of
the
fruits
he
shall
sell
unto
thee:
025:016
According
to
the
multitude
of
years
thou
shalt
increase
the
price
thereof,
and
according
to
the
fewness
of
years
thou
shalt
diminish
the
price
of
it:
for
according
to
the
number
of
the
years
of
the
fruits
doth
he
sell
unto
thee.
025:017
Ye
shall
not
therefore
oppress
one
another;
but
thou
shalt
fear
thy
God:for
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
025:018
Wherefore
ye
shall
do
my
statutes,
and
keep
my
judgments,
and
do
them;
and
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
land
in
safety.
025:019
And
the
land
shall
yield
her
fruit,
and
ye
shall
eat
your
fill,
and
dwell
therein
in
safety.
025:020
And
if
ye
shall
say,
What
shall
we
eat
the
seventh
year?
behold,
we
shall
not
sow,
nor
gather
in
our
increase:
025:021
Then
I
will
command
my
blessing
upon
you
in
the
sixth
year,
and
it
shall
bring
forth
fruit
for
three
years.
025:022
And
ye
shall
sow
the
eighth
year,
and
eat
yet
of
old
fruit
until
the
ninth
year;
until
her
fruits
come
in
ye
shall
eat
of
the
old
store.
025:023
The
land
shall
not
be
sold
for
ever:
for
the
land
is
mine,
for
ye
are
strangers
and
sojourners
with
me.
025:024
And
in
all
the
land
of
your
possession
ye
shall
grant
a
redemption
for
the
land.
025:025
If
thy
brother
be
waxen
poor,
and
hath
sold
away
some
of
his
possession,
and
if
any
of
his
kin
come
to
redeem
it,
then
shall
he
redeem
that
which
his
brother
sold.
025:026
And
if
the
man
have
none
to
redeem
it,
and
himself
be
able
to
redeem
it;
025:027
Then
let
him
count
the
years
of
the
sale
thereof,
and
restore
the
overplus
unto
the
man
to
whom
he
sold
it;
that
he
may
return
unto
his
possession.
025:028
But
if
he
be
not
able
to
restore
it
to
him,
then
that
which
is
sold
shall
remain
in
the
hand
of
him
that
hath
bought
it
until
the
year
of
jubile:
and
in
the
jubile
it
shall
go
out,
and
he
shall
return
unto
his
possession.
025:029
And
if
a
man
sell
a
dwelling
house
in
a
walled
city,
then
he
may
redeem
it
within
a
whole
year
after
it
is
sold;
within
a
full
year
may
he
redeem
it.
025:030
And
if
it
be
not
redeemed
within
the
space
of
a
full
year,
then
the
house
that
is
in
the
walled
city
shall
be
established
for
ever
to
him
that
bought
it
throughout
his
generations:
it
shall
not
go
out
in
the
jubile.
025:031
But
the
houses
of
the
villages
which
have
no
wall
round
about
them
shall
be
counted
as
the
fields
of
the
country:
they
may
be
redeemed,
and
they
shall
go
out
in
the
jubile.
025:032
Notwithstanding
the
cities
of
the
Levites,
and
the
houses
of
the
cities
of
their
possession,
may
the
Levites
redeem
at
any
time.
025:033
And
if
a
man
purchase
of
the
Levites,
then
the
house
that
was
sold,
and
the
city
of
his
possession,
shall
go
out
in
the
year
of
jubile:
for
the
houses
of
the
cities
of
the
Levites
are
their
possession
among
the
children
of
Israel.
025:034
But
the
field
of
the
suburbs
of
their
cities
may
not
be
sold;
for
it
is
their
perpetual
possession.
025:035
And
if
thy
brother
be
waxen
poor,
and
fallen
in
decay
with
thee;
then
thou
shalt
relieve
him:
yea,
though
he
be
a
stranger,
or
a
sojourner;
that
he
may
live
with
thee.
025:036
Take
thou
no
usury
of
him,
or
increase:
but
fear
thy
God;
that
thy
brother
may
live
with
thee.
025:037
Thou
shalt
not
give
him
thy
money
upon
usury,
nor
lend
him
thy
victuals
for
increase.
025:038
I
am
the
LORD
your
God,
which
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
to
give
you
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
to
be
your
God.
025:039
And
if
thy
brother
that
dwelleth
by
thee
be
waxen
poor,
and
be
sold
unto
thee;
thou
shalt
not
compel
him
to
serve
as
a
bondservant:
025:040
But
as
an
hired
servant,
and
as
a
sojourner,
he
shall
be
with
thee,
and
shall
serve
thee
unto
the
year
of
jubile.
025:041
And
then
shall
he
depart
from
thee,
both
he
and
his
children
with
him,
and
shall
return
unto
his
own
family,
and
unto
the
possession
of
his
fathers
shall
he
return.
025:042
For
they
are
my
servants,
which
I
brought
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt:
they
shall
not
be
sold
as
bondmen.
025:043
Thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigour;
but
shalt
fear
thy
God.
025:044
Both
thy
bondmen,
and
thy
bondmaids,
which
thou
shalt
have,
shall
be
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about
you;
of
them
shall
ye
buy
bondmen
and
bondmaids.
025:045
Moreover
of
the
children
of
the
strangers
that
do
sojourn
among
you,
of
them
shall
ye
buy,
and
of
their
families
that
are
with
you,
which
they
begat
in
your
land:
and
they
shall
be
your
possession.
025:046
And
ye
shall
take
them
as
an
inheritance
for
your
children
after
you,
to
inherit
them
for
a
possession;
they
shall
be
your
bondmen
for
ever:
but
over
your
brethren
the
children
of
Israel,
ye
shall
not
rule
one
over
another
with
rigour.
025:047
And
if
a
sojourner
or
stranger
wax
rich
by
thee,
and
thy
brother
that
dwelleth
by
him
wax
poor,
and
sell
himself
unto
the
stranger
or
sojourner
by
thee,
or
to
the
stock
of
the
stranger's
family:
025:048
After
that
he
is
sold
he
may
be
redeemed
again;
one
of
his
brethren
may
redeem
him:
025:049
Either
his
uncle,
or
his
uncle's
son,
may
redeem
him,
or
any
that
is
nigh
of
kin
unto
him
of
his
family
may
redeem
him;
or
if
he
be
able,
he
may
redeem
himself.
025:050
And
he
shall
reckon
with
him
that
bought
him
from
the
year
that
he
was
sold
to
him
unto
the
year
of
jubile:
and
the
price
of
his
sale
shall
be
according
unto
the
number
of
years,
according
to
the
time
of
an
hired
servant
shall
it
be
with
him.
025:051
If
there
be
yet
many
years
behind,
according
unto
them
he
shall
give
again
the
price
of
his
redemption
out
of
the
money
that
he
was
bought
for.
025:052
And
if
there
remain
but
few
years
unto
the
year
of
jubile,
then
he
shall
count
with
him,
and
according
unto
his
years
shall
he
give
him
again
the
price
of
his
redemption.
025:053
And
as
a
yearly
hired
servant
shall
he
be
with
him:
and
the
other
shall
not
rule
with
rigour
over
him
in
thy
sight.
025:054
And
if
he
be
not
redeemed
in
these
years,
then
he
shall
go
out
in
the
year
of
jubile,
both
he,
and
his
children
with
him.
025:055
For
unto
me
the
children
of
Israel
are
servants;
they
are
my
servants
whom
I
brought
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
026:001
Ye
shall
make
you
no
idols
nor
graven
image,
neither
rear
you
up
a
standing
image,
neither
shall
ye
set
up
any
image
of
stone
in
your
land,
to
bow
down
unto
it:
for
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
026:002
Ye
shall
keep
my
sabbaths,
and
reverence
my
sanctuary:
I
am
the
LORD.
026:003
If
ye
walk
in
my
statutes,
and
keep
my
commandments,
and
do
them;
026:004
Then
I
will
give
you
rain
in
due
season,
and
the
land
shall
yield
her
increase,
and
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
yield
their
fruit.
026:005
And
your
threshing
shall
reach
unto
the
vintage,
and
the
vintage
shall
reach
unto
the
sowing
time:
and
ye
shall
eat
your
bread
to
the
full,
and
dwell
in
your
land
safely.
026:006
And
I
will
give
peace
in
the
land,
and
ye
shall
lie
down,
and
none
shall
make
you
afraid:
and
I
will
rid
evil
beasts
out
of
the
land,
neither
shall
the
sword
go
through
your
land.
026:007
And
ye
shall
chase
your
enemies,
and
they
shall
fall
before
you
by
the
sword.
026:008
And
five
of
you
shall
chase
an
hundred,
and
an
hundred
of
you
shall
put
ten
thousand
to
flight:
and
your
enemies
shall
fall
before
you
by
the
sword.
026:009
For
I
will
have
respect
unto
you,
and
make
you
fruitful,
and
multiply
you,
and
establish
my
covenant
with
you.
026:010
And
ye
shall
eat
old
store,
and
bring
forth
the
old
because
of
the
new.
026:011
And
I
set
my
tabernacle
among
you:
and
my
soul
shall
not
abhor
you.
026:012
And
I
will
walk
among
you,
and
will
be
your
God,
and
ye
shall
be
my
people.
026:013
I
am
the
LORD
your
God,
which
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
that
ye
should
not
be
their
bondmen;
and
I
have
broken
the
bands
of
your
yoke,
and
made
you
go
upright.
026:014
But
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
me,
and
will
not
do
all
these
commandments;
026:015
And
if
ye
shall
despise
my
statutes,
or
if
your
soul
abhor
my
judgments,
so
that
ye
will
not
do
all
my
commandments,
but
that
ye
break
my
covenant:
026:016
I
also
will
do
this
unto
you;
I
will
even
appoint
over
you
terror,
consumption,
and
the
burning
ague,
that
shall
consume
the
eyes,
and
cause
sorrow
of
heart:
and
ye
shall
sow
your
seed
in
vain,
for
your
enemies
shall
eat
it.
026:017
And
I
will
set
my
face
against
you,
and
ye
shall
be
slain
before
your
enemies:
they
that
hate
you
shall
reign
over
you;
and
ye
shall
flee
when
none
pursueth
you.
026:018
And
if
ye
will
not
yet
for
all
this
hearken
unto
me,
then
I
will
punish
you
seven
times
more
for
your
sins.
026:019
And
I
will
break
the
pride
of
your
power;
and
I
will
make
your
heaven
as
iron,
and
your
earth
as
brass:
026:020
And
your
strength
shall
be
spent
in
vain:
for
your
land
shall
not
yield
her
increase,
neither
shall
the
trees
of
the
land
yield
their
fruits.
026:021
And
if
ye
walk
contrary
unto
me,
and
will
not
hearken
unto
me;
I
will
bring
seven
times
more
plagues
upon
you
according
to
your
sins.
026:022
I
will
also
send
wild
beasts
among
you,
which
shall
rob
you
of
your
children,
and
destroy
your
cattle,
and
make
you
few
in
number;
and
your
high
ways
shall
be
desolate.
026:023
And
if
ye
will
not
be
reformed
by
me
by
these
things,
but
will
walk
contrary
unto
me;
026:024
Then
will
I
also
walk
contrary
unto
you,
and
will
punish
you
yet
seven
times
for
your
sins.
026:025
And
I
will
bring
a
sword
upon
you,
that
shall
avenge
the
quarrel
of
my
covenant:
and
when
ye
are
gathered
together
within
your
cities,
I
will
send
the
pestilence
among
you;
and
ye
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy.
026:026
And
when
I
have
broken
the
staff
of
your
bread,
ten
women
shall
bake
your
bread
in
one
oven,
and
they
shall
deliver
you
your
bread
again
by
weight:
and
ye
shall
eat,
and
not
be
satisfied.
026:027
And
if
ye
will
not
for
all
this
hearken
unto
me,
but
walk
contrary
unto
me;
026:028
Then
I
will
walk
contrary
unto
you
also
in
fury;
and
I,
even
I,
will
chastise
you
seven
times
for
your
sins.
026:029
And
ye
shall
eat
the
flesh
of
your
sons,
and
the
flesh
of
your
daughters
shall
ye
eat.
026:030
And
I
will
destroy
your
high
places,
and
cut
down
your
images,
and
cast
your
carcases
upon
the
carcases
of
your
idols,
and
my
soul
shall
abhor
you.
026:031
And
I
will
make
your
cities
waste,
and
bring
your
sanctuaries
unto
desolation,
and
I
will
not
smell
the
savour
of
your
sweet
odours.
026:032
And
I
will
bring
the
land
into
desolation:
and
your
enemies
which
dwell
therein
shall
be
astonished
at
it.
026:033
And
I
will
scatter
you
among
the
heathen,
and
will
draw
out
a
sword
after
you:
and
your
land
shall
be
desolate,
and
your
cities
waste.
026:034
Then
shall
the
land
enjoy
her
sabbaths,
as
long
as
it
lieth
desolate,
and
ye
be
in
your
enemies'
land;
even
then
shall
the
land
rest,
and
enjoy
her
sabbaths.
026:035
As
long
as
it
lieth
desolate
it
shall
rest;
because
it
did
not
rest
in
your
sabbaths,
when
ye
dwelt
upon
it.
026:036
And
upon
them
that
are
left
alive
of
you
I
will
send
a
faintness
into
their
hearts
in
the
lands
of
their
enemies;
and
the
sound
of
a
shaken
leaf
shall
chase
them;
and
they
shall
flee,
as
fleeing
from
a
sword;
and
they
shall
fall
when
none
pursueth.
026:037
And
they
shall
fall
one
upon
another,
as
it
were
before
a
sword,
when
none
pursueth:
and
ye
shall
have
no
power
to
stand
before
your
enemies.
026:038
And
ye
shall
perish
among
the
heathen,
and
the
land
of
your
enemies
shall
eat
you
up.
026:039
And
they
that
are
left
of
you
shall
pine
away
in
their
iniquity
in
your
enemies'
lands;
and
also
in
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
shall
they
pine
away
with
them.
026:040
If
they
shall
confess
their
iniquity,
and
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers,
with
their
trespass
which
they
trespassed
against
me,
and
that
also
they
have
walked
contrary
unto
me;
026:041
And
that
I
also
have
walked
contrary
unto
them,
and
have
brought
them
into
the
land
of
their
enemies;
if
then
their
uncircumcised
hearts
be
humbled,
and
they
then
accept
of
the
punishment
of
their
iniquity:
026:042
Then
will
I
remember
my
covenant
with
Jacob,
and
also
my
covenant
with
Isaac,
and
also
my
covenant
with
Abraham
will
I
remember;
and
I
will
remember
the
land.
026:043
The
land
also
shall
be
left
of
them,
and
shall
enjoy
her
sabbaths,
while
she
lieth
desolate
without
them:
and
they
shall
accept
of
the
punishment
of
their
iniquity:
because,
even
because
they
despised
my
judgments,
and
because
their
soul
abhorred
my
statutes.
026:044
And
yet
for
all
that,
when
they
be
in
the
land
of
their
enemies,
I
will
not
cast
them
away,
neither
will
I
abhor
them,
to
destroy
them
utterly,
and
to
break
my
covenant
with
them:
for
I
am
the
LORD
their
God.
026:045
But
I
will
for
their
sakes
remember
the
covenant
of
their
ancestors,
whom
I
brought
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen,
that
I
might
be
their
God:
I
am
the
LORD.
026:046
These
are
the
statutes
and
judgments
and
laws,
which
the
LORD
made
between
him
and
the
children
of
Israel
in
mount
