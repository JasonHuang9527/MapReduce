Sinai
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
027:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
027:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
a
man
shall
make
a
singular
vow,
the
persons
shall
be
for
the
LORD
by
thy
estimation.
027:003
And
thy
estimation
shall
be
of
the
male
from
twenty
years
old
even
unto
sixty
years
old,
even
thy
estimation
shall
be
fifty
shekels
of
silver,
after
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary.
027:004
And
if
it
be
a
female,
then
thy
estimation
shall
be
thirty
shekels.
027:005
And
if
it
be
from
five
years
old
even
unto
twenty
years
old,
then
thy
estimation
shall
be
of
the
male
twenty
shekels,
and
for
the
female
ten
shekels.
027:006
And
if
it
be
from
a
month
old
even
unto
five
years
old,
then
thy
estimation
shall
be
of
the
male
five
shekels
of
silver,
and
for
the
female
thy
estimation
shall
be
three
shekels
of
silver.
027:007
And
if
it
be
from
sixty
years
old
and
above;
if
it
be
a
male,
then
thy
estimation
shall
be
fifteen
shekels,
and
for
the
female
ten
shekels.
027:008
But
if
he
be
poorer
than
thy
estimation,
then
he
shall
present
himself
before
the
priest,
and
the
priest
shall
value
him;
according
to
his
ability
that
vowed
shall
the
priest
value
him.
027:009
And
if
it
be
a
beast,
whereof
men
bring
an
offering
unto
the
LORD,
all
that
any
man
giveth
of
such
unto
the
LORD
shall
be
holy.
027:010
He
shall
not
alter
it,
nor
change
it,
a
good
for
a
bad,
or
a
bad
for
a
good:
and
if
he
shall
at
all
change
beast
for
beast,
then
it
and
the
exchange
thereof
shall
be
holy.
027:011
And
if
it
be
any
unclean
beast,
of
which
they
do
not
offer
a
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD,
then
he
shall
present
the
beast
before
the
priest:
027:012
And
the
priest
shall
value
it,
whether
it
be
good
or
bad:
as
thou
valuest
it,
who
art
the
priest,
so
shall
it
be.
027:013
But
if
he
will
at
all
redeem
it,
then
he
shall
add
a
fifth
part
thereof
unto
thy
estimation.
027:014
And
when
a
man
shall
sanctify
his
house
to
be
holy
unto
the
LORD,
then
the
priest
shall
estimate
it,
whether
it
be
good
or
bad:
as
the
priest
shall
estimate
it,
so
shall
it
stand.
027:015
And
if
he
that
sanctified
it
will
redeem
his
house,
then
he
shall
add
the
fifth
part
of
the
money
of
thy
estimation
unto
it,
and
it
shall
be
his.
027:016
And
if
a
man
shall
sanctify
unto
the
LORD
some
part
of
a
field
of
his
possession,
then
thy
estimation
shall
be
according
to
the
seed
thereof:
an
homer
of
barley
seed
shall
be
valued
at
fifty
shekels
of
silver.
027:017
If
he
sanctify
his
field
from
the
year
of
jubile,
according
to
thy
estimation
it
shall
stand.
027:018
But
if
he
sanctify
his
field
after
the
jubile,
then
the
priest
shall
reckon
unto
him
the
money
according
to
the
years
that
remain,
even
unto
the
year
of
the
jubile,
and
it
shall
be
abated
from
thy
estimation.
027:019
And
if
he
that
sanctified
the
field
will
in
any
wise
redeem
it,
then
he
shall
add
the
fifth
part
of
the
money
of
thy
estimation
unto
it,
and
it
shall
be
assured
to
him.
027:020
And
if
he
will
not
redeem
the
field,
or
if
he
have
sold
the
field
to
another
man,
it
shall
not
be
redeemed
any
more.
027:021
But
the
field,
when
it
goeth
out
in
the
jubile,
shall
be
holy
unto
the
LORD,
as
a
field
devoted;
the
possession
thereof
shall
be
the
priest's.
027:022
And
if
a
man
sanctify
unto
the
LORD
a
field
which
he
hath
bought,
which
is
not
of
the
fields
of
his
possession;
027:023
Then
the
priest
shall
reckon
unto
him
the
worth
of
thy
estimation,
even
unto
the
year
of
the
jubile:
and
he
shall
give
thine
estimation
in
that
day,
as
a
holy
thing
unto
the
LORD.
027:024
In
the
year
of
the
jubile
the
field
shall
return
unto
him
of
whom
it
was
bought,
even
to
him
to
whom
the
possession
of
the
land
did
belong.
027:025
And
all
thy
estimations
shall
be
according
to
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary:
twenty
gerahs
shall
be
the
shekel.
027:026
Only
the
firstling
of
the
beasts,
which
should
be
the
LORD's
firstling,
no
man
shall
sanctify
it;
whether
it
be
ox,
or
sheep:
it
is
the
LORD's.
027:027
And
if
it
be
of
an
unclean
beast,
then
he
shall
redeem
it
according
to
thine
estimation,
and
shall
add
a
fifth
part
of
it
thereto:
or
if
it
be
not
redeemed,
then
it
shall
be
sold
according
to
thy
estimation.
027:028
Notwithstanding
no
devoted
thing,
that
a
man
shall
devote
unto
the
LORD
of
all
that
he
hath,
both
of
man
and
beast,
and
of
the
field
of
his
possession,
shall
be
sold
or
redeemed:
every
devoted
thing
is
most
holy
unto
the
LORD.
027:029
None
devoted,
which
shall
be
devoted
of
men,
shall
be
redeemed;
but
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
027:030
And
all
the
tithe
of
the
land,
whether
of
the
seed
of
the
land,
or
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree,
is
the
LORD's:
it
is
holy
unto
the
LORD.
027:031
And
if
a
man
will
at
all
redeem
ought
of
his
tithes,
he
shall
add
thereto
the
fifth
part
thereof.
027:032
And
concerning
the
tithe
of
the
herd,
or
of
the
flock,
even
of
whatsoever
passeth
under
the
rod,
the
tenth
shall
be
holy
unto
the
LORD.
027:033
He
shall
not
search
whether
it
be
good
or
bad,
neither
shall
he
change
it:
and
if
he
change
it
at
all,
then
both
it
and
the
change
thereof
shall
be
holy;
it
shall
not
be
redeemed.
027:034
These
are
the
commandments,
which
the
LORD
commanded
Moses
for
the
children
of
Israel
in
mount
Sinai.
Book

001:004
And

you
there
shall
be

001:017
And
Moses
and
Aaron
took
these
men
which
are
expressed
by
their
names:
001:018
And
they
assembled
all
the
congregation
together
on
the
first
day
of
the
second
month,
and
they
declared

So

But
the
Levites
after

tribe
of
their
fathers
were
not
numbered
among

001:048
For
the
LORD
had
spoken
unto
Moses,
saying,
001:049
Only
thou
shalt
not
number
the
tribe
of
Levi,
neither
take
the
sum
of
them
among
the
children
of
Israel:
001:050
But
thou
shalt
appoint
the
Levites
over
the
tabernacle
of
testimony,
and
over
all
the
vessels
thereof,
and
over
all
things
that
belong
to
it:
they
shall
bear
the
tabernacle,
and
all
the
vessels
thereof;
and
they
shall
minister
unto
it,
and
shall
encamp
round
about
the
tabernacle.
001:051
And
when
the
tabernacle
setteth
forward,
the
Levites
shall
take
it
down:
and
when
the
tabernacle
is
to
be
pitched,
the
Levites
shall
set
it
up:
and
the
stranger
that
cometh
nigh
shall
be
put
to
death.
001:052
And
the
children
of
Israel
shall
pitch
their
tents,
every
man
by
his
own
camp,
and
every
man
by
his
own
standard,
throughout
their
hosts.
001:053
But
the
Levites
shall
pitch
round
about
the
tabernacle
of
testimony,
that
there
be
no
wrath
upon
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel:
and
the
Levites
shall
keep
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
testimony.
001:054
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
according
to

priest's
office.

and

died
before
the
LORD,
when
they
offered
strange
fire
before
the
LORD,
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai,
and
they
had
no
children:
and
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
ministered
in
the
priest's
office
in
the
sight
of
Aaron
their
father.
003:005
And
the
LORD
spake
unto

saying,
003:006
Bring
the
tribe
of
Levi
near,
and
present
them
before
Aaron
the
priest,
that
they
may
minister
unto
him.
003:007
And
they
shall
keep
his
charge,
and
the
charge
of
the
whole
congregation
before

of
the

to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle.
003:008
And

of
Israel,
to

the
service
of
the
tabernacle.
003:009
And
thou
shalt
give
the
Levites
unto
Aaron
and
to
his
sons:
they
are
wholly
given
unto
him
out
of
the
children
of
Israel.
003:010
And
thou
shalt
appoint
Aaron
and
his
sons,
and
they
shall
wait
on
their
priest's
office:
and
the
stranger
that
cometh
nigh
shall
be
put
to
death.
003:011
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
003:012
And
I,
behold,
I
have
taken
the
Levites
from
among
the
children
of
Israel
instead
of
all
the
firstborn
that
openeth
the
matrix
among
the
children
of
Israel:
therefore
the
Levites
shall
be
mine;
003:013
Because
all
the
firstborn
are
mine;
for
on
the
day
that
I
smote
all
the
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
I
hallowed
unto
me
all
the
firstborn
in
Israel,
both
man
and
beast:
mine
shall
they
be:
I
am
the
LORD.
003:014
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai,
saying,
003:015
Number
the
children
of
Levi
after
the
house
of
their
fathers,
by
their
families:
every
male
from
a
month
old
and
upward
shalt
thou
number
them.
003:016
And
Moses
numbered
them
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
as
he
was
commanded.
003:017
And
these
were
the

And
