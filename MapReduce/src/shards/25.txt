the
families
of
Merari
was
Zuriel
the
son
of
Abihail:
these
shall
pitch
on
the
side
of
the
tabernacle
northward.
003:036
And
under
the
custody
and
charge
of
the
sons
of
Merari
shall
be
the
boards
of
the
tabernacle,
and
the
bars
thereof,
and
the
pillars
thereof,
and
the
sockets
thereof,
and
all
the
vessels
thereof,
and
all
that
serveth
thereto,
003:037
And
the
pillars
of
the
court
round
about,
and
their
sockets,
and
their
pins,
and
their
cords.
003:038
But
those
that
encamp
before
the
tabernacle
toward
the
east,
even
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
eastward,
shall
be
Moses,
and
Aaron
and
his
sons,
keeping
the
charge
of
the
sanctuary
for
the
charge
of
the
children
of
Israel;
and
the
stranger
that
cometh
nigh
shall
be
put
to
death.
003:039
All
that
were
numbered
of
the
Levites,
which
Moses
and
Aaron
numbered
at
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
throughout
their
families,
all
the
males
from
a
month
old
and
upward,
were
twenty
and
two
thousand.
003:040
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Number
all
the
firstborn
of
the
males
of
the
children
of
Israel
from
a
month
old
and
upward,
and
take
the
number
of
their
names.
003:041
And
thou
shalt
take
the
Levites
for
me
(I
am
the
LORD)
instead
of
all
the
firstborn
among
the
children
of
Israel;
and
the
cattle
of
the
Levites
instead
of
all
the
firstlings
among
the
cattle
of
the
children
of
Israel.
003:042
And
Moses
numbered,
as
the
LORD
commanded
him,
all
the
firstborn
among
the
children
of
Israel.
003:043
And
all
the
firstborn
males
by
the
number
of
names,
from
a
month
old
and
upward,
of
those
that
were
numbered
of
them,
were
twenty
and
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
and
thirteen.
003:044
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
003:045
Take
the
Levites
instead
of
all
the
firstborn
among
the
children
of
Israel,
and
the
cattle
of
the
Levites
instead
of
their
cattle;
and
the
Levites
shall
be
mine:
I
am
the
LORD.
003:046
And
for
those
that
are
to
be
redeemed
of
the
two
hundred
and
threescore
and
thirteen
of
the
firstborn
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
are
more
than
the
Levites;
003:047
Thou
shalt
even
take
five
shekels
apiece
by
the
poll,
after
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary
shalt
thou
take
them:
(the
shekel
is
twenty
gerahs:)
003:048
And
thou
shalt
give
the
money,
wherewith
the
odd
number
of
them
is
to
be
redeemed,
unto
Aaron
and
to
his
sons.
003:049
And
Moses
took
the
redemption
money
of
them
that
were
over
and
above
them
that
were
redeemed
by
the
Levites:
003:050
Of
the
firstborn
of
the
children
of
Israel
took
he
the
money;
a
thousand
three
hundred
and
threescore
and
five
shekels,
after
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary:
003:051
And
Moses
gave
the
money
of
them
that
were
redeemed
unto
Aaron
and
to
his
sons,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
004:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron,
saying,
004:002
Take
the
sum
of
the
sons
of
Kohath
from
among
the
sons
of
Levi,
after
their
families,
by
the
house
of
their
fathers,
004:003
From
thirty
years
old
and
upward
even
until
fifty
years
old,
all
that
enter
into
the
host,
to
do
the
work
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
004:004
This
shall
be
the
service
of
the
sons
of
Kohath
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
about
the
most
holy
things:
004:005
And
when
the
camp
setteth
forward,
Aaron
shall
come,
and
his
sons,
and
they
shall
take
down
the
covering
vail,
and
cover
the
ark
of
testimony
with
it:
004:006
And
shall
put
thereon
the
covering
of
badgers'
skins,
and
shall
spread
over
it
a
cloth
wholly
of
blue,
and
shall
put
in
the
staves
thereof.
004:007
And
upon
the
table
of
shewbread
they
shall
spread
a
cloth
of
blue,
and
put
thereon
the
dishes,
and
the
spoons,
and
the
bowls,
and
covers
to
cover
withal:
and
the
continual
bread
shall
be
thereon:
004:008
And
they
shall
spread
upon
them
a
cloth
of
scarlet,
and
cover
the
same
with
a
covering
of
badgers'
skins,
and
shall
put
in
the
staves
thereof.
004:009
And
they
shall
take
a
cloth
of
blue,
and
cover
the
candlestick
of
the
light,
and
his
lamps,
and
his
tongs,
and
his
snuffdishes,
and
all
the
oil
vessels
thereof,
wherewith
they
minister
unto
it:
004:010
And
they
shall
put
it
and
all
the
vessels
thereof
within
a
covering
of
badgers'
skins,
and
shall
put
it
upon
a
bar.
004:011
And
upon
the
golden
altar
they
shall
spread
a
cloth
of
blue,
and
cover
it
with
a
covering
of
badgers'
skins,
and
shall
put
to
the
staves
thereof:
004:012
And
they
shall
take
all
the
instruments
of
ministry,
wherewith
they
minister
in
the
sanctuary,
and
put
them
in
a
cloth
of
blue,
and
cover
them
with
a
covering
of
badgers'
skins,
and
shall
put
them
on
a
bar:
004:013
And
they
shall
take
away
the
ashes
from
the
altar,
and
spread
a
purple
cloth
thereon:
004:014
And
they
shall
put
upon
it
all
the
vessels
thereof,
wherewith
they
minister
about
it,
even
the
censers,
the
fleshhooks,
and
the
shovels,
and
the
basons,
all
the
vessels
of
the
altar;
and
they
shall
spread
upon
it
a
covering
of
badgers'
skins,
and
put
to
the
staves
of
it.
004:015
And
when
Aaron
and
his
sons
have
made
an
end
of
covering
the
sanctuary,
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
sanctuary,
as
the
camp
is
to
set
forward;
after
that,
the
sons
of
Kohath
shall
come
to
bear
it:
but
they
shall
not
touch
any
holy
thing,
lest
they
die.
These
things
are
the
burden
of
the
sons
of
Kohath
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
004:016
And
to
the
office
of
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest
pertaineth
the
oil
for
the
light,
and
the
sweet
incense,
and
the
daily
meat
offering,
and
the
anointing
oil,
and
the
oversight
of
all
the
tabernacle,
and
of
all
that
therein
is,
in
the
sanctuary,
and
in
the
vessels
thereof.
004:017
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron
saying,
004:018
Cut
ye
not
off
the
tribe
of
the
families
of
the
Kohathites
from
among
the
Levites:
004:019
But
thus
do
unto
them,
that
they
may
live,
and
not
die,
when
they
approach
unto
the
most
holy
things:
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
go
in,
and
appoint
them
every
one
to
his
service
and
to
his
burden:
004:020
But
they
shall
not
go
in
to
see
when
the
holy
things
are
covered,
lest
they
die.
004:021
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
004:022
Take
also
the
sum
of
the
sons
of
Gershon,
throughout
the
houses
of
their
fathers,
by
their
families;
004:023
From
thirty
years
old
and
upward
until
fifty
years
old
shalt
thou
number
them;
all
that
enter
in
to
perform
the
service,
to
do
the
work
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
004:024
This
is
the
service
of
the
families
of
the
Gershonites,
to
serve,
and
for
burdens:
004:025
And
they
shall
bear
the
curtains
of
the
tabernacle,
and
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
his
covering,
and
the
covering
of
the
badgers'
skins
that
is
above
upon
it,
and
the
hanging
for
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
004:026
And
the
hangings
of
the
court,
and
the
hanging
for
the

of
the
gate
of
the
court,
which
is

and
by
the
altar
round
about,
and
their
cords,
and
all
the
instruments
of
their
service,
and
all
that
is
made
for
them:
so
shall
they
serve.
004:027
At
the
appointment
of
Aaron
and
his
sons
shall
be
all
the
service
of
the
sons
of
the
Gershonites,
in
all
their
burdens,
and
in
all
their
service:
and
ye
shall
appoint
unto
them
in
charge
all
their
burdens.
004:028
This
is
the
service
of
the
families
of
the
sons
of
Gershon
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
their
charge
shall
be
under
the
hand
of
Ithamar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest.
004:029
As
for
the
sons
of
Merari,
thou
shalt
number
them
after
their
families,
by
the
house
of
their
fathers;
004:030
From
thirty
years
old
and
upward
even
unto
fifty
years
old
shalt
thou
number
them,
every
one
that
entereth
into
the
service,
to
do
the
work
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
004:031
And
this
is
the
charge
of
their
burden,
according

all
their

in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation;
the
boards
of
the

and
the

thereof,
and
the

thereof,
and

thereof,
004:032
And
the
pillars
of
the
court
round
about,
and
their
sockets,
and
their
pins,
and
their
cords,
with
all
their
instruments,
and
with
all
their
service:
and
by
name
ye
shall
reckon
the
instruments
of
the
charge
of
their
burden.
004:033
This
is
the
service
of
the

From

004:037
These

And

004:041
These

004:042
And

by

From

004:044
Even

004:045
These

From

that

in

004:048
Even
those

were
eight
thousand
and
five

004:049
According
to
the

of
the
LORD
they
were
numbered
by
the
hand
of
Moses,
every
one
according
to
his
service,
and
according
to
his
burden:
thus
were
they
numbered
of
him,
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
005:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
005:002
Command
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
put
out
of
the
camp
every
leper,
and
every
one
that
hath
an
issue,
and
whosoever
is
defiled
by
the
dead:
005:003
Both
male
and
female
shall
ye
put
out,
without
the
camp
shall
ye
put
them;
that
they
defile
not
their
camps,
in
the
midst
whereof
I
dwell.
005:004
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
so,
and
put
them
out
without
the
camp:
as
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
so
did
the
children
of
Israel.
005:005
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
005:006
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
When
a
man
or
woman
shall
commit
any
sin
that
men
commit,
to
do
a
trespass
against
the
LORD,
and
that
person
be
guilty;
005:007
Then
they
shall
confess
their
sin
which
they
have
done:
and
he
shall
recompense
his
trespass
with
the
principal
thereof,
and
add
unto
it
the
fifth
part
thereof,
and
give
it
unto
him
against
whom
he
hath
trespassed.
005:008
But
if
the
man
have
no
kinsman
to
recompense
the
trespass
unto,
let
the
trespass
be
recompensed
unto
the
LORD,
even
to
the
priest;
beside
the
ram
of
the
atonement,
whereby
an
atonement
shall
be
made
for
him.
005:009
And
every
offering
of
all
the
holy
things
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
they
bring
unto
the
priest,
shall
be
his.
005:010
And
every
man's
hallowed
things
shall
be
his:
whatsoever
any
man
giveth
the
priest,
it
shall
be
his.
005:011
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
005:012
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
If
any
man's
wife
go
aside,
and
commit
a
trespass
against
him,
005:013
And
a
man
lie
with
her
carnally,
and
it
be
hid
from
the
eyes
of
her
husband,
and
be
kept
close,
and
she
be
defiled,
and
there
be
no
witness
against
her,
neither
she
be
taken
with
the
manner;
005:014
And
the
spirit
of
jealousy
come
upon
him,
and
he
be
jealous
of
his
wife,
and
she
be
defiled:
or
if
the
spirit
of
jealousy
come
upon
him,
and
he
be
jealous
of
his
wife,
and
she
be
not
defiled:
005:015
Then
shall
the
man
bring
his
wife
unto
the
priest,
and
he
shall
bring
her
offering
for
her,
the
tenth
part
of
an
ephah
of
barley
meal;
he
shall
pour
no
oil
upon
it,
nor
put
frankincense
thereon;
for
it
is
an
offering
of
jealousy,
an
offering
of
memorial,
bringing
iniquity
to
remembrance.
005:016
And
the
priest
shall
bring
her
near,
and
set
her
before
the
LORD:
005:017
And
the
priest
shall
take
holy
water
in
an
earthen
vessel;
and
of
the
dust
that
is
in
the
floor
of
the
tabernacle
the
priest
shall
take,
and
put
it
into
the
water:
005:018
And
the
priest
shall
set
the
woman
before
the
LORD,
and
uncover
the
woman's
head,
and
put
the
offering
of
memorial
in
her
hands,
which
is
the
jealousy
offering:
and
the
priest
shall
have
in
his
hand
the
bitter
water
that
causeth
the
curse:
005:019
And
the
priest
shall
charge
her
by
an
oath,
and
say
unto
the
woman,
If
no
man
have
lain
with
thee,
and
if
thou
hast
not
gone
aside
to
uncleanness
with
another
instead
of
thy
husband,
be
thou
free
from
this
bitter
water
that
causeth
the
curse:
005:020
But
if
thou
hast
gone
aside
to
another
instead
of
thy
husband,
and
if
thou
be
defiled,
and
some
man
have
lain
with
thee
beside
thine
husband:
005:021
Then
the
priest
shall
charge
the
woman
with
an
oath
of
cursing,
and
the
priest
shall
say
unto
the
woman,
The
LORD
make
thee
a
curse
and
an
oath
among
thy
people,
when
the
LORD
doth
make
thy
thigh
to
rot,
and
thy
belly
to
swell;
005:022
And
this
water
that
causeth
the
curse
shall
go
into
thy
bowels,
to
make
thy
belly
to
swell,
and
thy
thigh
to
rot:
And
the
woman
shall
say,
Amen,
amen.
005:023
And
the
priest
shall
write
these
curses
in
a
book,
and
he
shall
blot
them
out
with
the
bitter
water:
005:024
And
he
shall
cause
the
woman
to
drink
the
bitter
water
that
causeth
the
curse:
and
the
water
that
causeth
the
curse
shall
enter
into
her,
and
become
bitter.
005:025
Then
the
priest
shall
take
the
jealousy
offering
out
of
the
woman's
hand,
and
shall
wave
the
offering
before
the
LORD,
and
offer
it
upon
the
altar:
005:026
And
the
priest
shall
take
an
handful
of
the
offering,
even
the
memorial
thereof,
and
burn
it
upon
the
altar,
and
afterward
shall
cause
the
woman
to
drink
the
water.
005:027
And
when
he
hath
made
her
to
drink
the
water,
then
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that,
if
she
be
defiled,
and
have
done
trespass
against
her
husband,
that
the
water
that
causeth
the
curse
shall
enter
into
her,
and
become
bitter,
and
her
belly
shall
swell,
and
her
thigh
shall
rot:
and
the
woman
shall
be
a
curse
among
her
people.
005:028
And
if
the
woman
be
not
defiled,
but
be
clean;
then
she
shall
be
free,
and
shall
conceive
seed.
005:029
This
is
the
law
of
jealousies,
when
a
wife
goeth
aside
to
another
instead
of
her
husband,
and
is
defiled;
005:030
Or
when
the
spirit
of
jealousy
cometh
upon
him,
and
he
be
jealous
over
his
wife,
and
shall
set
the
woman
before
the
LORD,
and
the
priest
shall
execute
upon
her
all
this
law.
005:031
Then
shall
the
man
be
guiltless
from
iniquity,
and
this
woman
shall
bear
her
iniquity.
006:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
006:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
either
man
or
woman
shall
separate
themselves
to
vow
a
vow
of
a
Nazarite,
to
separate
themselves
unto
the
LORD:
006:003
He
shall
separate
himself
from
wine
and
strong
drink,
and
shall
drink
no
vinegar
of
wine,
or
vinegar
of
strong
drink,
neither
shall
he
drink
any
liquor
of
grapes,
nor
eat
moist
grapes,
or
dried.
006:004
All
the
days
of
his
separation
shall
he
eat
nothing
that
is
made
of
the
vine
tree,
from
the
kernels
even
to
the
husk.
006:005
All
the
days
of
the
vow
of
his
separation
there
shall
no
razor
come
upon
his
head:
until
the
days
be
fulfilled,
in
the
which
he
separateth
himself
unto
the
LORD,
he
shall
be
holy,
and
shall
let
the
locks
of
the
hair
of
his
head
grow.
006:006
All
the
days
that
he
separateth
himself
unto
the
LORD
he
shall
come
at
no
dead
body.
006:007
He
shall
not
make
himself
unclean
for
his
father,
or
for
his
mother,
for
his
brother,
or
for
his
sister,
when
they
die:
because
the
consecration
of
his
God
is
upon
his
head.
006:008
All
the
days
of
his
separation
he
is
holy
unto
the
LORD.
006:009
And
if
any
man
die
very
suddenly
by
him,
and
he
hath
defiled
the
head
of
his
consecration;
then
he
shall
shave
his
head
in
the
day
of
his
cleansing,
on
the
seventh
day
shall
he
shave
it.
006:010
And
on
the
eighth
day
he
shall
bring
two
turtles,
or
two
young
pigeons,
to
the
priest,
to
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
006:011
And
the
priest
shall
offer
the
one
for
a
sin
offering,
and
the
other
for
a
burnt
offering,
and
make
an
atonement
for
him,
for
that
he
sinned
by
the
dead,
and
shall
hallow
his
head
that
same
day.
006:012
And
he
shall
consecrate
unto
the
LORD
the
days
of
his
separation,
and
shall
bring
a
lamb
of
the
first
year
for
a
trespass
offering:
but
the
days
that
were
before
shall
be
lost,
because
his
separation
was
defiled.
006:013
And
this
is
the
law
of
the
Nazarite,
when
the
days
of
his
separation
are
fulfilled:
he
shall
be
brought
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
006:014
And
he
shall
offer
his
offering
unto
the
LORD,
one
he
lamb
of
the
first
year
without
blemish
for
a
burnt
offering,
and
one
ewe
lamb
of
the
first
year
without
blemish
for
a
sin
offering,
and
one
ram
without
blemish
for
peace
offerings,
006:015
And
a
basket
of
unleavened
bread,
cakes
of
fine
flour
mingled
with
oil,
and
wafers
of
unleavened
bread
anointed
with
oil,
and
their
meat
offering,
and
their
drink
offerings.
006:016
And
the
priest
shall
bring
them
before
the
LORD,
and
shall
offer
his
sin
offering,
and
his
burnt
offering:
006:017
And
he
shall
offer
the
ram
for
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings
unto
the
LORD,
with
the
basket
of
unleavened
bread:
the
priest
shall
offer
also
his
meat
offering,
and
his
drink
offering.
006:018
And
the
Nazarite
shall
shave
the
head
of
his
separation
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
shall
take
the
hair
of
the
head
of
his
separation,
and
put
it
in
the
fire
which
is
under
the
sacrifice
of
the
peace
offerings.
006:019
And
the
priest
shall
take
the
sodden
shoulder
of
the
ram,
and
one
unleavened
cake
out
of
the
basket,
and
one
unleavened
wafer,
and
shall
put
them
upon
the
hands
of
the
Nazarite,
after
the
hair
of
his
separation
is
shaven:
006:020
And
the
priest
shall
wave
them
for
a
wave
offering
before
the
LORD:
this
is
holy
for
the
priest,
with
the
wave
breast
and
heave
shoulder:
and
after
that
the
Nazarite
may
drink
wine.
006:021
This
is
the
law
of
the
Nazarite
who
hath
vowed,
and
of
his
offering
unto
the
LORD
for
his
separation,
beside
that
that
his
hand
shall
get:
according
to
the
vow
which
he
vowed,
so
he
must
do
after
the
law
of
his
separation.
006:022
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
006:023
Speak
unto
Aaron
and
unto
his
sons,
saying,
On
this
wise
ye
shall
bless
the
children
of
Israel,
saying
unto
them,
006:024
The
LORD
bless
thee,
and
keep
thee:
006:025
The
LORD
make
his
face
shine
upon
thee,
and
be
gracious
unto
thee:
006:026
The
LORD
lift
up
his
countenance
upon
thee,
and
give
thee
peace.
006:027
And
they
shall
put
my
name
upon
the
children
of
Israel,
and
I
will
bless
them.
007:001
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
day
that
Moses
had
fully
set
up
the
tabernacle,
and
had
anointed
it,
and
sanctified
it,
and
all
the
instruments
thereof,
both
the
altar
and
all
the
vessels
thereof,
and
had
anointed
them,
and
sanctified
them;
007:002
That
the
princes
of
Israel,
heads
of
the
house
of
their
fathers,
who
were
the
princes
of
the
tribes,
and
were
over
them
that
were
numbered,
offered:
007:003
And
they
brought
their
offering
before
the
LORD,
six
covered
wagons,
and
twelve
oxen;
a
wagon
for
two
of
the
princes,
and
for
each
one
an
ox:
and
they
brought
them
before
the
tabernacle.
007:004
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
007:005
Take
it
of
them,
that
they
may
be
to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation;
and
thou
shalt
give
them
unto
the
Levites,
to
every
man
according
to
his
service.
007:006
And
Moses
took
the
wagons
and
the
oxen,
and
gave
them
unto
the
Levites.
007:007
Two
wagons
and
four
oxen
he
gave
unto
the
sons
of
Gershon,
according
to
their
service:
007:008
And
four
wagons
and
eight
oxen
he
gave
unto
the
sons
of
Merari,
according
unto
their
service,
under
the
hand
of
Ithamar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest.
007:009
But
unto
the
sons
of
Kohath
he
gave
none:
because
the
service
of
the
sanctuary
belonging
unto
them
was
that
they
should
bear
upon
their
shoulders.
007:010
And
the
princes
offered
for
dedicating
of
the
altar
in
the
day
that
it
was
anointed,
even
the
princes
offered
their
offering
before
the
altar.
007:011
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
They
shall
offer
their
offering,
each
prince
on
his
day,
for
the
dedicating
of
the
altar.
007:012
And
he
that
offered
his
offering
the
first
day
was
Nahshon
the
son
of
Amminadab,
of
the
tribe
of
Judah:
007:013
And
his
offering
was
one
silver
charger,
the
weight
thereof
was
an
hundred
and
thirty
shekels,
one
silver
bowl
of
seventy
shekels,
after
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary;
both
of
them
were
full
of
fine
flour
mingled
with
oil
for
a
meat
offering:
007:014
One
spoon
of
ten
shekels
of
gold,
full
of
incense:
007:015
One
young
bullock,
one
ram,
one
lamb
of
the
first
year,
for
a
burnt
offering:
007:016
One
kid
of
the
goats
for
a
sin
offering:
007:017
And
for
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings,
two
oxen,
five
rams,
five
he
goats,
five
lambs
of
the
first
year:
this
was
the
offering
of
Nahshon
the
son
of
Amminadab.
007:018
On
the
second
day
Nethaneel
the
son
of
Zuar,
prince
of
Issachar,
did
offer:
007:019
He
offered
for
his
offering
