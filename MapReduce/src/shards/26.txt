with

then
he
heard
the
voice
of
one
speaking
unto
him
from
off
the
mercy
seat
that
was
upon
the
ark
of
testimony,
from
between
the
two
cherubims:
and
he
spake
unto
him.
008:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
008:002
Speak
unto
Aaron
and
say
unto
him,
When
thou
lightest
the
lamps,
the
seven
lamps
shall
give
light
over
against
the
candlestick.
008:003
And
Aaron
did
so;
he
lighted
the
lamps
thereof
over
against
the
candlestick,
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
008:004
And
this
work
of
the
candlestick
was
of
beaten
gold,
unto
the
shaft
thereof,
unto
the
flowers
thereof,
was
beaten
work:
according
unto
the
pattern
which
the
LORD
had
shewed
Moses,
so
he
made
the
candlestick.
008:005
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
008:006
Take
the
Levites
from
among
the
children
of
Israel,
and
cleanse
them.
008:007
And
thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
them,
to
cleanse
them:
Sprinkle
water
of
purifying
upon
them,
and
let
them
shave
all
their
flesh,
and
let
them
wash
their
clothes,
and
so
make
themselves
clean.
008:008
Then
let
them
take
a
young
bullock
with
his
meat
offering,
even
fine
flour
mingled
with
oil,
and
another
young
bullock
shalt
thou
take
for
a
sin
offering.
008:009
And
thou
shalt
bring
the
Levites
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
thou
shalt
gather
the
whole
assembly
of
the
children
of
Israel
together:
008:010
And
thou
shalt
bring
the
Levites
before
the
LORD:
and
the
children
of
Israel
shall
put
their
hands
upon
the
Levites:
008:011
And
Aaron
shall
offer
the
Levites
before
the
LORD
for
an
offering
of
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
may
execute
the
service
of
the
LORD.
008:012
And
the
Levites
shall
lay
their
hands
upon
the
heads
of
the
bullocks:
and
thou
shalt
offer
the
one
for
a
sin
offering,
and
the
other
for
a
burnt
offering,
unto
the
LORD,
to
make
an
atonement
for
the
Levites.
008:013
And
thou
shalt
set
the
Levites
before
Aaron,
and
before
his
sons,
and
offer
them
for
an
offering
unto
the
LORD.
008:014
Thus
shalt
thou
separate
the
Levites
from
among
the
children
of
Israel:
and
the
Levites
shall
be
mine.
008:015
And
after
that
shall
the
Levites
go
in
to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
thou
shalt
cleanse
them,
and
offer
them
for
an
offering.
008:016
For
they
are
wholly
given
unto
me
from
among
the
children
of
Israel;
instead
of
such
as
open
every
womb,
even
instead
of
the
firstborn
of
all
the
children
of
Israel,
have
I
taken
them
unto
me.
008:017
For
all
the
firstborn
of
the
children
of
Israel
are
mine,
both
man
and
beast:
on
the
day
that
I
smote
every
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
I
sanctified
them
for
myself.
008:018
And
I
have
taken
the
Levites
for
all
the
firstborn
of
the
children
of
Israel.
008:019
And
I
have
given
the
Levites
as
a
gift
to
Aaron
and
to
his
sons
from
among
the
children
of
Israel,
to
do
the
service
of
the
children
of
Israel
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
to
make
an
atonement
for
the
children
of
Israel:
that
there
be
no
plague
among
the
children
of
Israel,
when
the
children
of
Israel
come
nigh
unto
the
sanctuary.
008:020
And
Moses,
and
Aaron,
and
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
did
to
the
Levites
according
unto
all
that
the
LORD
commanded
Moses
concerning
the
Levites,
so
did
the
children
of
Israel
unto
them.
008:021
And
the
Levites
were
purified,
and
they
washed
their
clothes;
and
Aaron
offered
them
as
an
offering
before
the
LORD;
and
Aaron
made
an
atonement
for
them
to
cleanse
them.
008:022
And
after
that
went
the
Levites
in
to
do
their
service
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
Aaron,
and
before
his
sons:
as
the
LORD
had
commanded
Moses
concerning
the
Levites,
so
did
they
unto
them.
008:023
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
008:024
This
is
it
that
belongeth
unto
the
Levites:
from
twenty
and
five
years
old
and
upward
they
shall
go
in
to
wait
upon
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
008:025
And
from
the
age
of
fifty
years
they
shall
cease
waiting
upon
the
service
thereof,
and
shall
serve
no
more:
008:026
But
shall
minister
with
their
brethren
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
to
keep
the
charge,
and
shall
do
no
service.
Thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
the
Levites
touching
their
charge.
009:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai,
in
the
first
month
of
the
second
year
after
they
were
come
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
saying,
009:002
Let
the
children
of
Israel
also
keep
the
passover
at
his
appointed
season.
009:003
In
the
fourteenth
day
of
this
month,
at
even,
ye
shall
keep
it
in
his
appointed
season:
according
to
all
the
rites
of
it,
and
according
to
all
the
ceremonies
thereof,
shall
ye
keep
it.
009:004
And
Moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
should
keep
the
passover.
009:005
And
they
kept
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
first
month
at
even
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai:
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
commanded
Moses,
so
did
the
children
of
Israel.
009:006
And
there
were
certain
men,
who
were
defiled
by
the
dead
body
of
a
man,
that
they
could
not
keep
the
passover
on
that
day:
and
they
came
before
Moses
and
before
Aaron
on
that
day:
009:007
And
those
men
said
unto
him,
We
are
defiled
by
the
dead
body
of
a
man:
wherefore
are
we
kept
back,
that
we
may
not
offer
an
offering
of
the
LORD
in
his
appointed
season
among
the
children
of
Israel?
009:008
And
Moses
said
unto
them,
Stand
still,
and
I
will
hear
what
the
LORD
will
command
concerning
you.
009:009
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
009:010
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
If
any
man
of
you
or
of
your
posterity
shall
be
unclean
by
reason
of
a
dead
body,
or
be
in
a
journey
afar
off,
yet
he
shall
keep
the
passover
unto
the
LORD.
009:011
The
fourteenth
day
of
the
second
month
at
even
they
shall
keep
it,
and
eat
it
with
unleavened
bread
and
bitter
herbs.
009:012
They
shall
leave
none
of
it
unto
the
morning,
nor
break
any
bone
of
it:
according
to
all
the
ordinances
of
the
passover
they
shall
keep
it.
009:013
But
the
man
that
is
clean,
and
is
not
in
a
journey,
and
forbeareth
to
keep
the
passover,
even
the
same
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people:
because
he
brought
not
the
offering
of
the
LORD
in
his
appointed
season,
that
man
shall
bear
his
sin.
009:014
And
if
a
stranger
shall
sojourn
among
you,
and
will
keep
the
passover
unto
the
LORD;
according
to
the
ordinance
of
the
passover,
and
according
to
the
manner
thereof,
so
shall
he
do:
ye
shall
have
one
ordinance,
both
for
the
stranger,
and
for
him
that
was
born
in
the
land.
009:015
And
on
the
day
that
the
tabernacle
was
reared
up
the
cloud
covered
the
tabernacle,
namely,
the
tent
of
the
testimony:
and
at
even
there
was
upon
the
tabernacle
as
it
were
the
appearance
of
fire,
until
the
morning.
009:016
So
it
was
alway:
the
cloud
covered
it
by
day,
and
the
appearance
of
fire
by
night.
009:017
And
when
the
cloud
was
taken
up
from
the
tabernacle,
then
after
that
the
children
of
Israel
journeyed:
and
in
the
place
where
the
cloud
abode,
there
the
children
of
Israel
pitched
their
tents.
009:018
At
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
the
children
of
Israel
journeyed,
and
at
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
they
pitched:
as
long
as
the
cloud
abode
upon
the
tabernacle
they
rested
in
their
tents.
009:019
And
when
the
cloud
tarried
long
upon
the
tabernacle
many
days,
then
the
children
of
Israel
kept
the
charge
of
the
LORD,
and
journeyed
not.
009:020
And
so
it
was,
when
the
cloud
was
a
few
days
upon
the
tabernacle;
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
they
abode
in
their
tents,
and
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
they
journeyed.
009:021
And
so
it
was,
when
the
cloud
abode
from
even
unto
the
morning,
and
that
the
cloud
was
taken
up
in
the
morning,
then
they
journeyed:
whether
it
was
by
day
or
by
night
that
the
cloud
was
taken
up,
they
journeyed.
009:022
Or
whether
it
were
two
days,
or
a
month,
or
a
year,
that
the
cloud
tarried
upon
the
tabernacle,
remaining
thereon,
the
children
of
Israel
abode
in
their
tents,
and
journeyed
not:
but
when
it
was
taken
up,
they
journeyed.
009:023
At
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
they
rested
in
the
tents,
and
at
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
they
journeyed:
they
kept
the
charge
of
the
LORD,
at
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
010:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
010:002
Make
thee
two
trumpets
of
silver;
of
a
whole
piece
shalt
thou
make
them:
that
thou
mayest
use
them
for
the
calling
of
the
assembly,
and
for
the
journeying
of
the
camps.
010:003
And
when
they
shall
blow
with
them,
all
the
assembly
shall
assemble
themselves
to
thee
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
010:004
And
if
they
blow
but
with
one
trumpet,
then
the
princes,
which
are
heads
of
the
thousands
of
Israel,
shall
gather
themselves
unto
thee.
010:005
When
ye
blow
an
alarm,
then
the
camps
that
lie
on
the
east
parts
shall
go
forward.
010:006
When
ye
blow
an
alarm
the
second
time,
then
the
camps
that
lie
on
the
south
side
shall
take
their
journey:
they
shall
blow
an
alarm
for
their
journeys.
010:007
But
when
the
congregation
is
to
be
gathered
together,
ye
shall
blow,
but
ye
shall
not
sound
an
alarm.
010:008
And
the
sons
of
Aaron,
the
priests,
shall
blow
with
the
trumpets;
and
they
shall
be
to
you
for
an
ordinance
for
ever
throughout
your
generations.
010:009
And
if
ye
go
to
war
in
your
land
against
the
enemy
that
oppresseth
you,
then
ye
shall
blow
an
alarm
with
the
trumpets;
and
ye
shall
be
remembered
before
the
LORD
your
God,
and
ye
shall
be
saved
from
your
enemies.
010:010
Also
in
the
day
of
your
gladness,
and
in
your
solemn
days,
and
in
the
beginnings
of
your
months,
ye
shall
blow
with
the
trumpets
over
your
burnt
offerings,
and
over
the
sacrifices
of
your
peace
offerings;
that
they
may
be
to
you
for
a
memorial
before
your
God:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
010:011
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
twentieth
day
of
the
second
month,
in
the
second
year,
that
the
cloud
was
taken
up
from
off
the
tabernacle
of
the
testimony.
010:012
And
the
children
of
Israel
took
their
journeys
out
of
the
wilderness
of
Sinai;
and
the
cloud
rested
in
the
wilderness
of
Paran.
010:013
And
they
first
took
their
journey
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
010:014
In
the
first
place
went
the
standard
of
the
camp
of
the
children
of
Judah
according
to
their
armies:
and
over
his
host
was
Nahshon
the
son
of
Amminadab.
010:015
And
over
the
host
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Issachar
was
Nethaneel
the
son
of
Zuar.
010:016
And
over
the
host
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Zebulun
was
Eliab
the
son
of
Helon.
010:017
And
the
tabernacle
was
taken
down;
and
the
sons
of
Gershon
and
the
sons
of
Merari
set
forward,
bearing
the
tabernacle.
010:018
And
the
standard
of
the
camp
of
Reuben
set
forward
according
to
their
armies:
and
over
his
host
was
Elizur
the
son
of
Shedeur.
010:019
And
over
the
host
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Simeon
was
Shelumiel
the
son
of
Zurishaddai.
010:020
And
over
the
host
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Gad
was
Eliasaph
the
son
of
Deuel.
010:021
And
the
Kohathites
set
forward,
bearing
the
sanctuary:
and
the
other
did
set
up
the
tabernacle
against
they
came.
010:022
And
the
standard
of
the
camp
of
the
children
of
Ephraim
set
forward
according
to
their
armies:
and
over
his
host
was
Elishama
the
son
of
Ammihud.
010:023
And
over
the
host
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Manasseh
was
Gamaliel
the
son
of
Pedahzur.
010:024
And
over
the
host
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Benjamin
was
Abidan
the
son
of
Gideoni.
010:025
And
the
standard
of
the
camp
of
the
children
of
Dan
set
forward,
which
was
the
rereward
of
all
the
camps
throughout
their
hosts:
and
over
his
host
was
Ahiezer
the
son
of
Ammishaddai.
010:026
And
over
the
host
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Asher
was
Pagiel
the
son
of
Ocran.
010:027
And
over
the
host
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Naphtali
was
Ahira
the
son
of
Enan.
010:028
Thus
were
the
journeyings
of
the
children
of
Israel
according
to
their
armies,
when
they
set
forward.
010:029
And
Moses
said
unto
Hobab,
the
son
of
Raguel
the
Midianite,
Moses'
father
in
law,
We
are
journeying
unto
the
place
of
which
the
LORD
said,
I
will
give
it
you:
come
thou
with
us,
and
we
will
do
thee
good:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken
good
concerning
Israel.
010:030
And
he
said
unto
him,
I
will
not
go;
but
I
will
depart
to
mine
own
land,
and
to
my
kindred.
010:031
And
he
said,
Leave
us
not,
I
pray
thee;
forasmuch
as
thou
knowest
how
we
are
to
encamp
in
the
wilderness,
and
thou
mayest
be
to
us
instead
of
eyes.
010:032
And
it
shall
be,
if
thou
go
with
us,
yea,
it
shall
be,
that
what
goodness
the
LORD
shall
do
unto
us,
the
same
will
we
do
unto
thee.
010:033
And
they
departed
from
the
mount
of
the
LORD
three
days'
journey:
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
went
before
them
in
the
three
days'
journey,
to
search
out
a
resting
place
for
them.
010:034
And
the
cloud
of
the
LORD
was
upon
them
by
day,
when
they
went
out
of
the
camp.
010:035
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
ark
set
forward,
that
Moses
said,
Rise
up,
LORD,
and
let
thine
enemies
be
scattered;
and
let
them
that
hate
thee
flee
before
thee.
010:036
And
when
it
rested,
he
said,
Return,
O
LORD,
unto
the
many
thousands
of
Israel.
011:001
And
when
the
people
complained,
it
displeased
the
LORD:
and
the
LORD
heard
it;
and
his
anger
was
kindled;
and
the
fire
of
the
LORD
burnt
among
them,
and
consumed
them
that
were
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
camp.
011:002
And
the
people
cried
unto
Moses;
and
when
Moses
prayed
unto
the
LORD,
the
fire
was
quenched.
011:003
And
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
Taberah:
because
the
fire
of
the
LORD
burnt
among
them.
011:004
And
the
mixt
multitude
that
was
among
them
fell
a
lusting:
and
the
children
of
Israel
also
wept
again,
and
said,
Who
shall
give
us
flesh
to
eat?
011:005
We
remember
the
fish,
which
we
did
eat
in
Egypt
freely;
the
cucumbers,
and
the
