melons,
and
the
leeks,
and
the
onions,
and
the
garlick:
011:006
But
now
our
soul
is
dried
away:
there
is
nothing
at
all,
beside
this
manna,
before
our
eyes.
011:007
And
the
manna
was
as
coriander
seed,
and
the
colour
thereof
as
the
colour
of
bdellium.
011:008
And
the
people
went
about,
and
gathered
it,
and
ground
it
in
mills,
or
beat
it
in
a
mortar,
and
baked
it
in
pans,
and
made
cakes
of
it:
and
the
taste
of
it
was
as
the
taste
of
fresh
oil.
011:009
And
when
the
dew
fell
upon
the
camp
in
the
night,
the
manna
fell
upon
it.
011:010
Then
Moses
heard
the
people
weep
throughout
their
families,
every
man
in
the
door
of
his
tent:
and
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
greatly;
Moses
also
was
displeased.
011:011
And
Moses
said
unto
the
LORD,
Wherefore
hast
thou
afflicted
thy
servant?
and
wherefore
have
I
not
found
favour
in
thy
sight,
that
thou
layest
the
burden
of
all
this
people
upon
me?
011:012
Have
I
conceived
all
this
people?
have
I
begotten
them,
that
thou
shouldest
say
unto
me,
Carry
them
in
thy
bosom,
as
a
nursing
father
beareth
the
sucking
child,
unto
the
land
which
thou
swarest
unto
their
fathers?
011:013
Whence
should
I
have
flesh
to
give
unto
all
this
people?
for
they
weep
unto
me,
saying,
Give
us
flesh,
that
we
may
eat.
011:014
I
am
not
able
to
bear
all
this
people
alone,
because
it
is
too
heavy
for
me.
011:015
And
if
thou
deal
thus
with
me,
kill
me,
I
pray
thee,
out
of
hand,
if
I
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight;
and
let
me
not
see
my
wretchedness.
011:016
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Gather
unto
me
seventy
men
of
the
elders
of
Israel,
whom
thou
knowest
to
be
the
elders
of
the
people,
and
officers
over
them;
and
bring
them
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
that
they
may
stand
there
with
thee.
011:017
And
I
will
come
down
and
talk
with
thee
there:
and
I
will
take
of
the
spirit
which
is
upon
thee,
and
will
put
it
upon
them;
and
they
shall
bear
the
burden
of
the
people
with
thee,
that
thou
bear
it
not
thyself
alone.
011:018
And
say
thou
unto
the
people,
Sanctify
yourselves
against
to
morrow,
and
ye
shall
eat
flesh:
for
ye
have
wept
in
the
ears
of
the
LORD,
saying,
Who
shall
give
us
flesh
to
eat?
for
it
was
well
with
us
in
Egypt:
therefore
the
LORD
will
give
you
flesh,
and
ye
shall
eat.
011:019
Ye
shall
not
eat
one
day,
nor
two
days,
nor
five
days,
neither
ten
days,
nor
twenty
days;
011:020
But
even
a
whole
month,
until
it
come
out
at
your
nostrils,
and
it
be
loathsome
unto
you:
because
that
ye
have
despised
the
LORD
which
is
among
you,
and
have
wept
before
him,
saying,
Why
came
we
forth
out
of
Egypt?
011:021
And
Moses
said,
The
people,
among
whom
I
am,
are
six
hundred
thousand
footmen;
and
thou
hast
said,
I
will
give
them
flesh,
that
they
may
eat
a
whole
month.
011:022
Shall
the
flocks
and
the
herds
be
slain
for
them,
to
suffice
them?
or
shall
all
the
fish
of
the
sea
be
gathered
together
for
them,
to
suffice
them?
011:023
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Is
the
LORD's
hand
waxed
short?
thou
shalt
see
now
whether
my
word
shall
come
to
pass
unto
thee
or
not.
011:024
And
Moses
went
out,
and
told
the
people
the
words
of
the
LORD,
and
gathered
the
seventy
men
of
the
elders
of
the
people,
and
set
them
round
about
the
tabernacle.
011:025
And
the
LORD
came
down
in
a
cloud,
and
spake
unto
him,
and
took
of
the
spirit
that
was
upon
him,
and
gave
it
unto
the
seventy
elders:
and
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
the
spirit
rested
upon
them,
they
prophesied,
and
did
not
cease.
011:026
But
there
remained
two
of
the
men
in
the
camp,
the
name
of
the
one
was
Eldad,
and
the
name
of
the
other
Medad:
and
the
spirit
rested
upon
them;
and
they
were
of
them
that
were
written,
but
went
not
out
unto
the
tabernacle:
and
they
prophesied
in
the
camp.
011:027
And
there
ran
a
young
man,
and
told
Moses,
and
said,
Eldad
and
Medad
do
prophesy
in
the
camp.
011:028
And
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
the
servant
of
Moses,
one
of
his
young
men,
answered
and
said,
My
lord
Moses,
forbid
them.
011:029
And
Moses
said
unto
him,
Enviest
thou
for
my
sake?
would
God
that
all
the
LORD's
people
were
prophets,
and
that
the
LORD
would
put
his
spirit
upon
them!
011:030
And
Moses
gat
him
into
the
camp,
he
and
the
elders
of
Israel.
011:031
And
there
went
forth
a
wind
from
the
LORD,
and
brought
quails
from
the
sea,
and
let
them
fall
by
the
camp,
as
it
were
a
day's
journey
on
this
side,
and
as
it
were
a
day's
journey
on
the
other
side,
round
about
the
camp,
and
as
it
were
two
cubits
high
upon
the
face
of
the
earth.
011:032
And
the
people
stood
up
all
that
day,
and
all
that
night,
and
all
the
next
day,
and
they
gathered
the
quails:
he
that
gathered
least
gathered
ten
homers:
and
they
spread
them
all
abroad
for
themselves
round
about
the
camp.
011:033
And
while
the
flesh
was
yet
between
their
teeth,
ere
it
was
chewed,
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
the
people,
and
the
LORD
smote
the
people
with
a
very
great
plague.
011:034
And
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
Kibrothhattaavah:
because
there
they
buried
the
people
that
lusted.
011:035
And
the
people
journeyed
from
Kibrothhattaavah
unto
Hazeroth;
and
abode
at
Hazeroth.
012:001
And
Miriam
and
Aaron
spake
against
Moses
because
of
the
Ethiopian
woman
whom
he
had
married:
for
he
had
married
an
Ethiopian
woman.
012:002
And
they
said,
Hath
the
LORD
indeed
spoken
only
by
Moses?
hath
he
not
spoken
also
by
us?
And
the
LORD
heard
it.
012:003
(Now
the
man
Moses
was
very
meek,
above
all
the
men
which
were
upon
the
face
of
the
earth.)
012:004
And
the
LORD
spake
suddenly
unto
Moses,
and
unto
Aaron,
and
unto
Miriam,
Come
out
ye
three
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
And
they
three
came
out.
012:005
And
the
LORD
came
down
in
the
pillar
of
the
cloud,
and
stood
in
the
door
of
the
tabernacle,
and
called
Aaron
and
Miriam:
and
they
both
came
forth.
012:006
And
he
said,
Hear
now
my
words:
If
there
be
a
prophet
among
you,
I
the
LORD
will
make
myself
known
unto
him
in
a
vision,
and
will
speak
unto
him
in
a
dream.
012:007
My
servant
Moses
is
not
so,
who
is
faithful
in
all
mine
house.
012:008
With
him
will
I
speak
mouth
to
mouth,
even
apparently,
and
not
in
dark
speeches;
and
the
similitude
of
the
LORD
shall
he
behold:
wherefore
then
were
ye
not
afraid
to
speak
against
my
servant
Moses?
012:009
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
them;
and
he
departed.
012:010
And
the
cloud
departed
from
off
the
tabernacle;
and,
behold,
Miriam
became
leprous,
white
as
snow:
and
Aaron
looked
upon
Miriam,
and,
behold,
she
was
leprous.
012:011
And
Aaron
said
unto
Moses,
Alas,
my
lord,
I
beseech
thee,
lay
not
the
sin
upon
us,
wherein
we
have
done
foolishly,
and
wherein
we
have
sinned.
012:012
Let
her
not
be
as
one
dead,
of
whom
the
flesh
is
half
consumed
when
he
cometh
out
of
his
mother's
womb.
012:013
And
Moses
cried
unto
the
LORD,
saying,
Heal
her
now,
O
God,
I
beseech
thee.
012:014
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
If
her
father
had
but
spit
in
her
face,
should
she
not
be
ashamed
seven
days?
let
her
be
shut
out
from
the
camp
seven
days,
and
after
that
let
her
be
received
in
again.
012:015
And
Miriam
was
shut
out
from
the
camp
seven
days:
and
the
people
journeyed
not
till
Miriam
was
brought
in
again.
012:016
And
afterward
the
people
removed
from
Hazeroth,
and
pitched
in
the
wilderness
of
Paran.
013:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
013:002
Send
thou
men,
that
they
may
search
the
land
of
Canaan,
which
I
give
unto
the
children
of
Israel:
of
every
tribe
of
their
fathers
shall
ye
send
a
man,
every
one
a
ruler
among
them.
013:003
And
Moses
by
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
sent
them
from
the
wilderness
of
Paran:
all
those
men
were
heads
of
the
children
of
Israel.
013:004
And
these
were
their
names:
of
the
tribe
of
Reuben,
Shammua
the
son
of
Zaccur.
013:005
Of
the
tribe
of
Simeon,
Shaphat
the
son
of
Hori.
013:006
Of
the
tribe
of
Judah,
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh.
013:007
Of
the
tribe
of
Issachar,
Igal
the
son
of
Joseph.
013:008
Of
the
tribe
of
Ephraim,
Oshea
the
son
of
Nun.
013:009
Of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin,
Palti
the
son
of
Raphu.
013:010
Of
the
tribe
of
Zebulun,
Gaddiel
the
son
of
Sodi.
013:011
Of
the
tribe
of
Joseph,
namely,
of
the
tribe
of
Manasseh,
Gaddi
the
son
of
Susi.
013:012
Of
the
tribe
of
Dan,
Ammiel
the
son
of
Gemalli.
013:013
Of
the
tribe
of
Asher,
Sethur
the
son
of
Michael.
013:014
Of
the
tribe
of
Naphtali,
Nahbi
the
son
of
Vophsi.
013:015
Of
the
tribe
of
Gad,
Geuel
the
son
of
Machi.
013:016
These
are
the
names
of
the
men
which
Moses
sent
to
spy
out
the
land.
And
Moses
called
Oshea
the
son
of
Nun
Jehoshua.
013:017
And
Moses
sent
them
to
spy
out
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
said
unto
them,
Get
you
up
this
way
southward,
and
go
up
into
the
mountain:
013:018
And
see
the
land,
what
it
is,
and
the
people
that
dwelleth
therein,
whether
they
be
strong
or
weak,
few
or
many;
013:019
And
what
the
land
is
that
they
dwell
in,
whether
it
be
good
or
bad;
and
what
cities
they
be
that
they
dwell
in,
whether
in
tents,
or
in
strong
holds;
013:020
And
what
the
land
is,
whether
it
be
fat
or
lean,
whether
there
be
wood
therein,
or
not.
And
be
ye
of
good
courage,
and
bring
of
the
fruit
of
the
land.
Now
the
time
was
the
time
of
the
firstripe
grapes.
013:021
So
they
went
up,
and
searched
the
land
from
the
wilderness
of
Zin
unto
Rehob,
as
men
come
to
Hamath.
013:022
And
they
ascended
by
the
south,
and
came
unto
Hebron;
where
Ahiman,
Sheshai,
and
Talmai,
the
children
of
Anak,
were.
(Now
Hebron
was
built
seven
years
before
Zoan
in
Egypt.)
013:023
And
they
came
unto
the
brook
of
Eshcol,
and
cut
down
from
thence
a
branch
with
one
cluster
of
grapes,
and
they
bare
it
between
two
upon
a
staff;
and
they
brought
of
the
pomegranates,
and
of
the
figs.
013:024
The
place
was
called
the
brook
Eshcol,
because
of
the
cluster
of
grapes
which
the
children
of
Israel
cut
down
from
thence.
013:025
And
they
returned
from
searching
of
the
land
after
forty
days.
013:026
And
they
went
and
came
to
Moses,
and
to
Aaron,
and
to
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
unto
the
wilderness
of
Paran,
to
Kadesh;
and
brought
back
word
unto
them,
and
unto
all
the
congregation,
and
shewed
them
the
fruit
of
the
land.
013:027
And
they
told
him,
and
said,
We
came
unto
the
land
whither
thou
sentest
us,
and
surely
it
floweth
with
milk
and
honey;
and
this
is
the
fruit
of
it.
013:028
Nevertheless
the
people
be
strong
that
dwell
in
the
land,
and
the
cities
are
walled,
and
very
great:
and
moreover
we
saw
the
children
of
Anak
there.
013:029
The
Amalekites
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
south:
and
the
Hittites,
and
the
Jebusites,
and
the
Amorites,
dwell
in
the
mountains:
and
the
Canaanites
dwell
by
the
sea,
and
by
the
coast
of
Jordan.
013:030
And
Caleb
stilled
the
people
before
Moses,
and
said,
Let
us
go
up
at
once,
and
possess
it;
for
we
are
well
able
to
overcome
it.
013:031
But
the
men
that
went
up
with
him
said,
We
be
not
able
to
go
up
against
the
people;
for
they
are
stronger
than
we.
013:032
And
they
brought
up
an
evil
report
of
the
land
which
they
had
searched
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
The
land,
through
which
we
have
gone
to
search
it,
is
a
land
that
eateth
up
the
inhabitants
thereof;
and
all
the
people
that
we
saw
in
it
are
men
of
a
great
stature.
013:033
And
there
we
saw
the
giants,
the
sons
of
Anak,
which
come
of
the
giants:
and
we
were
in
our
own
sight
as
grasshoppers,
and
so
we
were
in
their
sight.
014:001
And
all
the
congregation
lifted
up
their
voice,
and
cried;
and
the
people
wept
that
night.
014:002
And
all
the
children
of
Israel
murmured
against
Moses
and
against
Aaron:
and
the
whole
congregation
said
unto
them,
Would
God
that
we
had
died
in
the
land
of
Egypt!
or
would
God
we
had
died
in
this
wilderness!
014:003
And
wherefore
hath
the
LORD
brought
us
unto
this
land,
to
fall
by
the
sword,
that
our
wives
and
our
children
should
be
a
prey?
were
it
not
better
for
us
to
return
into
Egypt?
014:004
And
they
said
one
to
another,
Let
us
make
a
captain,
and
let
us
return
into
Egypt.
014:005
Then
Moses
and
Aaron
fell
on
their
faces
before
all
the
assembly
of
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel.
014:006
And
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
and
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh,
which
were
of
them
that
searched
the
land,
rent
their
clothes:
014:007
And
they
spake
unto
all
the
company
of
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
The
land,
which
we
passed
through
to
search
it,
is
an
exceeding
good
land.
014:008
If
the
LORD
delight
in
us,
then
he
will
bring
us
into
this
land,
and
give
it
us;
a
land
which
floweth
with
milk
and
honey.
014:009
Only
rebel
not
ye
against
the
LORD,
neither
fear
ye
the
people
of
the
land;
for
they
are
bread
for
us:
their
defence
is
departed
from
them,
and
the
LORD
is
with
us:
fear
them
not.
014:010
But
all
the
congregation
bade
stone
them
with
stones.
And
the
glory
of
the
LORD
appeared
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
all
the
children
of
Israel.
014:011
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
How
long
will
this
people
provoke
me?
and
how
long
will
it
be
ere
they
believe
me,
for
all
the
signs
which
I
have
shewed
among
them?
014:012
I
will
smite
them
with
the
pestilence,
and
disinherit
them,
and
will
make
of
thee
a
greater
nation
and
mightier
than
they.
014:013
And
Moses
said
unto
the
LORD,
Then
the
Egyptians
shall
hear
it,
(for
thou
broughtest
up
this
people
in
thy
might
from
among
them;)
014:014
And
they
will
tell
it
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
land:
for
they
have
heard
that
thou
LORD
art
among
this
people,
that
thou
LORD
art
seen
face
to
face,
and
that
thy
cloud
standeth
over
them,
and
that
thou
goest
before
them,
by
day
time
in
a
pillar
of
a
cloud,
and
in
a
pillar
of
fire
by
night.
014:015
Now
if
thou
shalt
kill
all
this
people
as
one
man,
then
the
nations
which
have
heard
the
fame
of
thee
will
speak,
saying,
014:016
Because
the
LORD
was
not
able
to
bring
this
people
into
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
them,
therefore
he
hath
slain
them
in
the
wilderness.
014:017
And
now,
I
beseech
thee,
let
the
power
of
my
Lord
be
great,
according
as
thou
hast
spoken,
saying,
014:018
The
LORD
is
longsuffering,
and
of
great
mercy,
forgiving
iniquity
and
transgression,
and
by
no
means
clearing
the
guilty,
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation.
014:019
Pardon,
I
beseech
thee,
the
iniquity
of
this
people
according
unto
the
greatness
of
thy
mercy,
and
as
thou
hast
forgiven
this
people,
from
Egypt
even
until
now.
014:020
And
the
LORD
said,
I
have
pardoned
according
to
thy
word:
014:021
But
as
truly
as
I
live,
all
the
earth
shall
be
filled
with
the
glory
of
the
LORD.
014:022
Because
all
those
men
which
have
seen
my
glory,
and
my
miracles,
which
I
did
in
Egypt
and
in
the
wilderness,
and
have
tempted
me
now
these
ten
times,
and
have
not
hearkened
to
my
voice;
014:023
Surely
they
shall
not
see
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
their
fathers,
neither
shall
any
of
them
that
provoked
me
see
it:
014:024
But
my
servant
Caleb,
because
he
had
another
spirit
with
him,
and
hath
followed
me
fully,
him
will
I
bring
into
the
land
whereinto
he
went;
and
his
seed
shall
possess
it.
014:025
(Now
the
Amalekites
and
the
Canaanites
dwelt
in
the
valley.)
Tomorrow
turn
you,
and
get
you
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
Red
sea.
014:026
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron,
saying,
014:027
How
long
shall
I
bear
with
this
evil
congregation,
which
murmur
against
me?
I
have
heard
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
they
murmur
against
me.
014:028
Say
unto
them,
As
truly
as
I
live,
saith
the
LORD,
as
ye
have
spoken
in
mine
ears,
so
will
I
do
to
you:
014:029
Your
carcases
shall
fall
in
this
wilderness;
and
all
that
were
numbered
of
you,
according
to
your
whole
number,
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
which
have
murmured
against
me.
014:030
Doubtless
ye
shall
not
come
into
the
land,
concerning
which
I
sware
to
make
you
dwell
therein,
save
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh,
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun.
014:031
But
your
little
ones,
which
ye
said
should
be
a
prey,
them
will
I
bring
in,
and
they
shall
know
the
land
which
ye
have
despised.
014:032
But
as
for
you,
your
carcases,
they
shall
fall
in
this
wilderness.
014:033
And
your
children
shall
wander
in
the
wilderness
forty
years,
and
bear
your
whoredoms,
until
your
carcases
be
wasted
in
the
wilderness.
014:034
After
the
number
of
the
days
in
which
ye
searched
the
land,
even
forty
days,
each
day
for
a
year,
shall
ye
bear
your
iniquities,
even
forty
years,
and
ye
shall
know
my
breach
of
promise.
014:035
I
the
LORD
have
said,
I
will
surely
do
it
unto
all
this
evil
congregation,
that
are
gathered
together
against
me:
in
this
wilderness
they
shall
be
consumed,
and
there
they
shall
die.
014:036
And
the
men,
which
Moses
sent
to
search
the
land,
who
returned,
and
made
all
the
congregation
to
murmur
against
him,
by
bringing
up
a
slander
upon
the
land,
014:037
Even
those
men
that
did
bring
up
the
evil
report
upon
the
land,
died
by
the
plague
before
the
LORD.
014:038
But
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
and
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh,
which
were
of
the
men
that
went
to
search
the
land,
lived
still.
014:039
And
Moses
told
these
sayings
unto
all
the
children
of
Israel:
and
the
people
mourned
greatly.
014:040
And
they
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
gat
them
up
into
the
top
of
the
mountain,
saying,
Lo,
we
be
here,
and
will
go
up
unto
the
place
which
the
LORD
hath
promised:
for
we
have
sinned.
014:041
And
Moses
said,
Wherefore
now
do
ye
transgress
the
commandment
of
the
LORD?
but
it
shall
not
prosper.
014:042
Go
not
up,
for
the
LORD
is
not
among
you;
that
ye
be
not
smitten
before
your
enemies.
014:043
For
the
Amalekites
and
the
Canaanites
are
there
before
you,
and
ye
shall
fall
by
the
sword:
because
ye
are
turned
away
from
the
LORD,
therefore
the
LORD
will
not
be
with
you.
014:044
But
they
presumed
to
go
up
unto
the
hill
top:
nevertheless
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
and
Moses,
departed
not
out
of
the
camp.
014:045
Then
the
Amalekites
came
down,
and
the
Canaanites
which
dwelt
in
that
hill,
and
smote
them,
and
discomfited
them,
even
unto
Hormah.
015:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
015:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
ye
be
come
into
the
land
of
your
habitations,
which
I
give
unto
you,
015:003
And
will
make
an
offering
by
fire
unto
the
LORD,
a
burnt
offering,
or
a
sacrifice
in
performing
a
vow,
or
in
a
freewill
offering,
or
in
your
solemn
feasts,
to
make
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD,
of
the
herd
or
of
the
flock:
015:004
Then
shall
he
that
offereth
his
offering
unto
the
LORD
bring
a
meat
offering
of
a
tenth
deal
of
flour
mingled
with
the
fourth
part
of
an
hin
of
oil.
015:005
And
the
fourth
part
of
an
hin
of
wine
for
a
drink
offering
shalt
thou
prepare
with
the
burnt
offering
or
sacrifice,
for
one
lamb.
015:006
Or
for
a
ram,
thou
shalt
prepare
for
a
meat
offering
two
tenth
deals
of
flour
mingled
with
the
third
part
of
an
hin
of
oil.
015:007
And
for
a
drink
offering
thou
shalt
offer
the
third
part
of
an
hin
of
wine,
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
015:008
And
when
thou
preparest
a
bullock
for
a
burnt
offering,
or
for
a
sacrifice
in
performing
a
vow,
or
peace
offerings
unto
the
LORD:
015:009
Then
shall
he
bring
with
a
bullock
a
meat
offering
of
three
tenth
deals
of
flour
mingled
with
half
an
hin
of
oil.
015:010
And
thou
shalt
bring
for
a
drink
offering
half
an
hin
of
wine,
for
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
015:011
Thus
shall
it
be
done
for
one
bullock,
or
for
one
ram,
or
for
a
lamb,
or
a
kid.
015:012
According
to
the
number
that
ye
shall
prepare,
so
shall
ye
do
to
every
one
according
to
their
number.
015:013
All
that
are
born
of
the
country
shall
do
these
things
after
this
manner,
in
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
015:014
And
if
a
stranger
sojourn
with
you,
or
whosoever
be
among
you
in
your
generations,
and
will
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD;
as
ye
do,
so
he
shall
do.
015:015
One
ordinance
shall
be
both
for
you
of
the
congregation,
and
also
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
with
you,
an
ordinance
for
ever
in
your
generations:
as
ye
are,
so
shall
the
stranger
be
before
the
LORD.
015:016
One
law
and
one
manner
shall
be
for
you,
and
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
with
you.
015:017
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
015:018
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
ye
come
into
the
land
whither
I
bring
you,
015:019
Then
it
shall
be,
that,
when
ye
eat
of
the
bread
of
the
land,
ye
shall
offer
up
an
heave
offering
unto
the
LORD.
015:020
Ye
shall
offer
up
a
cake
of
the
first
of
your
dough
for
an
heave
offering:
as
ye
do
the
heave
offering
of
the
threshingfloor,
so
shall
ye
heave
it.
015:021
Of
the
first
of
your
dough
ye
shall
give
unto
the
LORD
an
heave
offering
in
your
generations.
015:022
And
if
ye
have
erred,
and
not
observed
all
these
commandments,
which
the
LORD
hath
spoken
unto
Moses,
015:023
Even
all
that
the
LORD
hath
commanded
you
by
the
hand
of
Moses,
from
the
day
that
the
LORD
commanded
Moses,
and
henceforward
among
your
generations;
015:024
Then
it
shall
be,
if
ought
be
committed
by
ignorance
without
the
knowledge
of
the
congregation,
that
all
the
congregation
shall
offer
one
young
bullock
for
a
burnt
offering,
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD,
with
his
meat
offering,
and
his
drink
offering,
according
to
the
manner,
and
one
kid
of
the
goats
for
a
sin
offering.
015:025
And
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
them;
for
it
is
ignorance:
and
they
shall
bring
their
offering,
a
sacrifice
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD,
and
their
sin
offering
before
the
LORD,
for
their
ignorance:
015:026
And
it
shall
be
forgiven
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
them;
seeing
all
the
people
were
in
ignorance.
015:027
And
if
any
soul
sin
through
ignorance,
then
he
shall
bring
a
she
