goat
of
the
first
year
for
a
sin
offering.
015:028
And
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
the
soul
that
sinneth
ignorantly,
when
he
sinneth
by
ignorance
before
the
LORD,
to
make
an
atonement
for
him;
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him.
015:029
Ye
shall
have
one
law
for
him
that
sinneth
through
ignorance,
both
for
him
that
is
born
among
the
children
of
Israel,
and
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
them.
015:030
But
the
soul
that
doeth
ought
presumptuously,
whether
he
be
born
in
the
land,
or
a
stranger,
the
same
reproacheth
the
LORD;
and
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people.
015:031
Because
he
hath
despised
the
word
of
the
LORD,
and
hath
broken
his
commandment,
that
soul
shall
utterly
be
cut
off;
his
iniquity
shall
be
upon
him.
015:032
And
while
the
children
of
Israel
were
in
the
wilderness,
they
found
a
man
that
gathered
sticks
upon
the
sabbath
day.
015:033
And
they
that
found
him
gathering
sticks
brought
him
unto
Moses
and
Aaron,
and
unto
all
the
congregation.
015:034
And
they
put
him
in
ward,
because
it
was
not
declared
what
should
be
done
to
him.
015:035
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
The
man
shall
be
surely
put
to
death:
all
the
congregation
shall
stone
him
with
stones
without
the
camp.
015:036
And
all
the
congregation
brought
him
without
the
camp,
and
stoned
him
with
stones,
and
he
died;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
015:037
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
015:038
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
bid
them
that
they
make
them
fringes
in
the
borders
of
their
garments
throughout
their
generations,
and
that
they
put
upon
the
fringe
of
the
borders
a
ribband
of
blue:
015:039
And
it
shall
be
unto
you
for
a
fringe,
that
ye
may
look
upon
it,
and
remember
all
the
commandments
of
the
LORD,
and
do
them;
and
that
ye
seek
not
after
your
own
heart
and
your
own
eyes,
after
which
ye
use
to
go
a
whoring:
015:040
That
ye
may
remember,
and
do
all
my
commandments,
and
be
holy
unto
your
God.
015:041
I
am
the
LORD
your
God,
which
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
to
be
your
God:
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
016:001
Now
Korah,
the
son
of
Izhar,
the
son
of
Kohath,
the
son
of
Levi,
and
Dathan
and
Abiram,
the
sons
of
Eliab,
and
On,
the
son
of
Peleth,
sons
of
Reuben,
took
men:
016:002
And
they
rose
up
before
Moses,
with
certain
of
the
children
of
Israel,
two
hundred
and
fifty
princes
of
the
assembly,
famous
in
the
congregation,
men
of
renown:
016:003
And
they
gathered
themselves
together
against
Moses
and
against
Aaron,
and
said
unto
them,
Ye
take
too
much
upon
you,
seeing
all
the
congregation
are
holy,
every
one
of
them,
and
the
LORD
is
among
them:
wherefore
then
lift
ye
up
yourselves
above
the
congregation
of
the
LORD?
016:004
And
when
Moses
heard
it,
he
fell
upon
his
face:
016:005
And
he
spake
unto
Korah
and
unto
all
his
company,
saying,
Even
to
morrow
the
LORD
will
shew
who
are
his,
and
who
is
holy;
and
will
cause
him
to
come
near
unto
him:
even
him
whom
he
hath
chosen
will
he
cause
to
come
near
unto
him.
016:006
This
do;
Take
you
censers,
Korah,
and
all
his
company;
016:007
And
put
fire
therein,
and
put
incense
in
them
before
the
LORD
to
morrow:
and
it
shall
be
that
the
man
whom
the
LORD
doth
choose,
he
shall
be
holy:
ye
take
too
much
upon
you,
ye
sons
of
Levi.
016:008
And
Moses
said
unto
Korah,
Hear,
I
pray
you,
ye
sons
of
Levi:
016:009
Seemeth
it
but
a
small
thing
unto
you,
that
the
God
of
Israel
hath
separated
you
from
the
congregation
of
Israel,
to
bring
you
near
to
himself
to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD,
and
to
stand
before
the
congregation
to
minister
unto
them?
016:010
And
he
hath
brought
thee
near
to
him,
and
all
thy
brethren
the
sons
of
Levi
with
thee:
and
seek
ye
the
priesthood
also?
016:011
For
which
cause
both
thou
and
all
thy
company
are
gathered
together
against
the
LORD:
and
what
is
Aaron,
that
ye
murmur
against
him?
016:012
And
Moses
sent
to
call
Dathan
and
Abiram,
the
sons
of
Eliab:
which
said,
We
will
not
come
up:
016:013
Is
it
a
small
thing
that
thou
hast
brought
us
up
out
of
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey,
to
kill
us
in
the
wilderness,
except
thou
make
thyself
altogether
a
prince
over
us?
016:014
Moreover
thou
hast
not
brought
us
into
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey,
or
given
us
inheritance
of
fields
and
vineyards:
wilt
thou
put
out
the
eyes
of
these
men?
we
will
not
come
up.
016:015
And
Moses
was
very
wroth,
and
said
unto
the
LORD,
Respect
not
thou
their
offering:
I
have
not
taken
one
ass
from
them,
neither
have
I
hurt
one
of
them.
016:016
And
Moses
said
unto
Korah,
Be
thou
and
all
thy
company
before
the
LORD,
thou,
and
they,
and
Aaron,
to
morrow:
016:017
And
take
every
man
his
censer,
and
put
incense
in
them,
and
bring
ye
before
the
LORD
every
man
his
censer,
two
hundred
and
fifty
censers;
thou
also,
and
Aaron,
each
of
you
his
censer.
016:018
And
they
took
every
man
his
censer,
and
put
fire
in
them,
and
laid
incense
thereon,
and
stood
in
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
with
Moses
and
Aaron.
016:019
And
Korah
gathered
all
the
congregation
against
them
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
all
the
congregation.
016:020
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron,
saying,
016:021
Separate
yourselves
from
among
this
congregation,
that
I
may
consume
them
in
a
moment.
016:022
And
they
fell
upon
their
faces,
and
said,
O
God,
the
God
of
the
spirits
of
all
flesh,
shall
one
man
sin,
and
wilt
thou
be
wroth
with
all
the
congregation?
016:023
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
016:024
Speak
unto
the
congregation,
saying,
Get
you
up
from
about
the
tabernacle
of
Korah,
Dathan,
and
Abiram.
016:025
And
Moses
rose
up
and
went
unto
Dathan
and
Abiram;
and
the
elders
of
Israel
followed
him.
016:026
And
he
spake
unto
the
congregation,
saying,
Depart,
I
pray
you,
from
the
tents
of
these
wicked
men,
and
touch
nothing
of
their's,
lest
ye
be
consumed
in
all
their
sins.
016:027
So
they
gat
up
from
the
tabernacle
of
Korah,
Dathan,
and
Abiram,
on
every
side:
and
Dathan
and
Abiram
came
out,
and
stood
in
the
door
of
their
tents,
and
their
wives,
and
their
sons,
and
their
little
children.
016:028
And
Moses
said,
Hereby
ye
shall
know
that
the
LORD
hath
sent
me
to
do
all
these
works;
for
I
have
not
done
them
of
mine
own
mind.
016:029
If
these
men
die
the
common
death
of
all
men,
or
if
they
be
visited
after
the
visitation
of
all
men;
then
the
LORD
hath
not
sent
me.
016:030
But
if
the
LORD
make
a
new
thing,
and
the
earth
open
her
mouth,
and
swallow
them
up,
with
all
that
appertain
unto
them,
and
they
go
down
quick
into
the
pit;
then
ye
shall
understand
that
these
men
have
provoked
the
LORD.
016:031
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
these
words,
that
the
ground
clave
asunder
that
was
under
them:
016:032
And
the
earth
opened
her
mouth,
and
swallowed
them
up,
and
their
houses,
and
all
the
men
that
appertained
unto
Korah,
and
all
their
goods.
016:033
They,
and
all
that
appertained
to
them,
went
down
alive
into
the
pit,
and
the
earth
closed
upon
them:
and
they
perished
from
among
the
congregation.
016:034
And
all
Israel
that
were
round
about
them
fled
at
the
cry
of
them:
for
they
said,
Lest
the
earth
swallow
us
up
also.
016:035
And
there
came
out
a
fire
from
the
LORD,
and
consumed
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
that
offered
incense.
016:036
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
016:037
Speak
unto
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest,
that
he
take
up
the
censers
out
of
the
burning,
and
scatter
thou
the
fire
yonder;
for
they
are
hallowed.
016:038
The
censers
of
these
sinners
against
their
own
souls,
let
them
make
them
broad
plates
for
a
covering
of
the
altar:
for
they
offered
them
before
the
LORD,
therefore
they
are
hallowed:
and
they
shall
be
a
sign
unto
the
children
of
Israel.
016:039
And
Eleazar
the
priest
took
the
brasen
censers,
wherewith
they
that
were
burnt
had
offered;
and
they
were
made
broad
plates
for
a
covering
of
the
altar:
016:040
To
be
a
memorial
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
that
no
stranger,
which
is
not
of
the
seed
of
Aaron,
come
near
to
offer
incense
before
the
LORD;
that
he
be
not
as
Korah,
and
as
his
company:
as
the
LORD
said
to
him
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
016:041
But
on
the
morrow
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
murmured
against
Moses
and
against
Aaron,
saying,
Ye
have
killed
the
people
of
the
LORD.
016:042
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
congregation
was
gathered
against
Moses
and
against
Aaron,
that
they
looked
toward
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and,
behold,
the
cloud
covered
it,
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
appeared.
016:043
And
Moses
and
Aaron
came
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
016:044
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
016:045
Get
you
up
from
among
this
congregation,
that
I
may
consume
them
as
in
a
moment.
And
they
fell
upon
their
faces.
016:046
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron,
Take
a
censer,
and
put
fire
therein
from
off
the
altar,
and
put
on
incense,
and
go
quickly
unto
the
congregation,
and
make
an
atonement
for
them:
for
there
is
wrath
gone
out
from
the
LORD;
the
plague
is
begun.
016:047
And
Aaron
took
as
Moses
commanded,
and
ran
into
the
midst
of
the
congregation;
and,
behold,
the
plague
was
begun
among
the
people:
and
he
put
on
incense,
and
made
an
atonement
for
the
people.
016:048
And
he
stood
between
the
dead
and
the
living;
and
the
plague
was
stayed.
016:049
Now
they
that
died
in
the
plague
were
fourteen
thousand
and
seven
hundred,
beside
them
that
died
about
the
matter
of
Korah.
016:050
And
Aaron
returned
unto
Moses
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation:
and
the
plague
was
stayed.
017:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
017:002
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
take
of
every
one
of
them
a
rod
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers,
of
all
their
princes
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
twelve
rods:
write
thou
every
man's
name
upon
his
rod.
017:003
And
thou
shalt
write
Aaron's
name
upon
the
rod
of
Levi:
for
one
rod
shall
be
for
the
head
of
the
house
of
their
fathers.
017:004
And
thou
shalt
lay
them
up
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
the
testimony,
where
I
will
meet
with
you.
017:005
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
the
man's
rod,
whom
I
shall
choose,
shall
blossom:
and
I
will
make
to
cease
from
me
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
Israel,
whereby
they
murmur
against
you.
017:006
And
Moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
every
one
of
their
princes
gave
him
a
rod
apiece,
for
each
prince
one,
according
to
their
fathers'
houses,
even
twelve
rods:
and
the
rod
of
Aaron
was
among
their
rods.
017:007
And
Moses
laid
up
the
rods
before
the
LORD
in
the
tabernacle
of
witness.
017:008
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
on
the
morrow
Moses
went
into
the
tabernacle
of
witness;
and,
behold,
the
rod
of
Aaron
for
the
house
of
Levi
was
budded,
and
brought
forth
buds,
and
bloomed
blossoms,
and
yielded
almonds.
017:009
And
Moses
brought
out
all
the
rods
from
before
the
LORD
unto
all
the
children
of
Israel:
and
they
looked,
and
took
every
man
his
rod.
017:010
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Bring
Aaron's
rod
again
before
the
testimony,
to
be
kept
for
a
token
against
the
rebels;
and
thou
shalt
quite
take
away
their
murmurings
from
me,
that
they
die
not.
017:011
And
Moses
did
so:
as
the
LORD
commanded
him,
so
did
he.
017:012
And
the
children
of
Israel
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
Behold,
we
die,
we
perish,
we
all
perish.
017:013
Whosoever
cometh
any
thing
near
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD
shall
die:
shall
we
be
consumed
with
dying?
018:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Aaron,
Thou
and
thy
sons
and
thy
father's
house
with
thee
shall
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
sanctuary:
and
thou
and
thy
sons
with
thee
shall
bear
the
iniquity
of
your
priesthood.
018:002
And
thy
brethren
also
of
the
tribe
of
Levi,
the
tribe
of
thy
father,
bring
thou
with
thee,
that
they
may
be
joined
unto
thee,
and
minister
unto
thee:
but
thou
and
thy
sons
with
thee
shall
minister
before
the
tabernacle
of
witness.
018:003
And
they
shall
keep
thy
charge,
and
the
charge
of
all
the
tabernacle:
only
they
shall
not
come
nigh
the
vessels
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
altar,
that
neither
they,
nor
ye
also,
die.
018:004
And
they
shall
be
joined
unto
thee,
and
keep
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
for
all
the
service
of
the
tabernacle:
and
a
stranger
shall
not
come
nigh
unto
you.
018:005
And
ye
shall
keep
the
charge
of
the
sanctuary,
and
the
charge
of
the
altar:
that
there
be
no
wrath
any
more
upon
the
children
of
Israel.
018:006
And
I,
behold,
I
have
taken
your
brethren
the
Levites
from
among
the
children
of
Israel:
to
you
they
are
given
as
a
gift
for
the
LORD,
to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
018:007
Therefore
thou
and
thy
sons
with
thee
shall
keep
your
priest's
office
for
everything
of
the
altar,
and
within
the
vail;
and
ye
shall
serve:
I
have
given
your
priest's
office
unto
you
as
a
service
of
gift:
and
the
stranger
that
cometh
nigh
shall
be
put
to
death.
018:008
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Aaron,
Behold,
I
also
have
given
thee
the
charge
of
mine
heave
offerings
of
all
the
hallowed
things
of
the
children
of
Israel;
unto
thee
have
I
given
them
by
reason
of
the
anointing,
and
to
thy
sons,
by
an
ordinance
for
ever.
018:009
This
shall
be
thine
of
the
most
holy
things,
reserved
from
the
fire:
every
oblation
of
their's,
every
meat
offering
of
their's,
and
every
sin
offering
of
their's,
and
every
trespass
offering
of
their's
which
they
shall
render
unto
me,
shall
be
most
holy
for
thee
and
for
thy
sons.
018:010
In
the
most
holy
place
shalt
thou
eat
it;
every
male
shall
eat
it:
it
shall
be
holy
unto
thee.
018:011
And
this
is
thine;
the
heave
offering
of
their
gift,
with
all
the
wave
offerings
of
the
children
of
Israel:
I
have
given
them
unto
thee,
and
to
thy
sons
and
to
thy
daughters
with
thee,
by
a
statute
for
ever:
every
one
that
is
clean
in
thy
house
shall
eat
of
it.
018:012
All
the
best
of
the
oil,
and
all
the
best
of
the
wine,
and
of
the
wheat,
the
firstfruits
of
them
which
they
shall
offer
unto
the
LORD,
them
have
I
given
thee.
018:013
And
whatsoever
is
first
ripe
in
the
land,
which
they
shall
bring
unto
the
LORD,
shall
be
thine;
every
one
that
is
clean
in
thine
house
shall
eat
of
it.
018:014
Every
thing
devoted
in
Israel
shall
be
thine.
018:015
Every
thing
that
openeth
the
matrix
in
all
flesh,
which
they
bring
unto
the
LORD,
whether
it
be
of
men
or
beasts,
shall
be
thine:
nevertheless
the
firstborn
of
man
shalt
thou
surely
redeem,
and
the
firstling
of
unclean
beasts
shalt
thou
redeem.
018:016
And
those
that
are
to
be
redeemed
from
a
month
old
shalt
thou
redeem,
according
to
thine
estimation,
for
the
money
of
five
shekels,
after
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary,
which
is
twenty
gerahs.
018:017
But
the
firstling
of
a
cow,
or
the
firstling
of
a
sheep,
or
the
firstling
of
a
goat,
thou
shalt
not
redeem;
they
are
holy:
thou
shalt
sprinkle
their
blood
upon
the
altar,
and
shalt
burn
their
fat
for
an
offering
made
by
fire,
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
018:018
And
the
flesh
of
them
shall
be
thine,
as
the
wave
breast
and
as
the
right
shoulder
are
thine.
018:019
All
the
heave
offerings
of
the
holy
things,
which
the
children
of
Israel
offer
unto
the
LORD,
have
I
given
thee,
and
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
with
thee,
by
a
statute
for
ever:
it
is
a
covenant
of
salt
for
ever
before
the
LORD
unto
thee
and
to
thy
seed
with
thee.
018:020
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Aaron,
Thou
shalt
have
no
inheritance
in
their
land,
neither
shalt
thou
have
any
part
among
them:
I
am
thy
part
and
thine
inheritance
among
the
children
of
Israel.
018:021
And,
behold,
I
have
given
the
children
of
Levi
all
the
tenth
in
Israel
for
an
inheritance,
for
their
service
which
they
serve,
even
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
018:022
Neither
must
the
children
of
Israel
henceforth
come
nigh
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
lest
they
bear
sin,
and
die.
018:023
But
the
Levites
shall
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity:
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
throughout
your
generations,
that
among
the
children
of
Israel
they
have
no
inheritance.
018:024
But
the
tithes
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
they
offer
as
an
heave
offering
unto
the
LORD,
I
have
given
to
the
Levites
to
inherit:
therefore
I
have
said
unto
them,
Among
the
children
of
Israel
they
shall
have
no
inheritance.
018:025
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
018:026
Thus
speak
unto
the
Levites,
and
say
unto
them,
When
ye
take
of
the
children
of
Israel
the
tithes
which
I
have
given
you
from
them
for
your
inheritance,
then
ye
shall
offer
up
an
heave
offering
of
it
for
the
LORD,
even
a
tenth
part
of
the
tithe.
018:027
And
this
your
heave
offering
shall
be
reckoned
unto
you,
as
though
it
were
the
corn
of
the
threshingfloor,
and
as
the
fulness
of
the
winepress.
018:028
Thus
ye
also
shall
offer
an
heave
offering
unto
the
LORD
of
all
your
tithes,
which
ye
receive
of
the
children
of
Israel;
and
ye
shall
give
thereof
the
LORD's
heave
offering
to
Aaron
the
priest.
018:029
Out
of
all
your
gifts
ye
shall
offer
every
heave
offering
of
the
LORD,
of
all
the
best
thereof,
even
the
hallowed
part
thereof
out
of
it.
018:030
Therefore
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
When
ye
have
heaved
the
best
thereof
from
it,
then
it
shall
be
counted
unto
the
Levites
as
the
increase
of
the
threshingfloor,
and
as
the
increase
of
the
winepress.
018:031
And
ye
shall
eat
it
in
every
place,
ye
and
your
households:
for
it
is
your
reward
for
your
service
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
018:032
And
ye
shall
bear
no
sin
by
reason
of
it,
when
ye
have
heaved
from
it
the
best
of
it:
neither
shall
ye
pollute
the
holy
things
of
the
children
of
Israel,
lest
ye
die.
019:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron,
saying,
019:002
This
is
the
ordinance
of
the
law
which
the
LORD
hath
commanded,
saying,
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
bring
thee
a
red
heifer
without
spot,
wherein
is
no
blemish,
and
upon
which
never
came
yoke:
019:003
And
ye
shall
give
her
unto
Eleazar
the
priest,
that
he
may
bring
her
forth
without
the
camp,
and
one
shall
slay
her
before
his
face:
019:004
And
Eleazar
the
priest
shall
take
of
her
blood
with
his
finger,
and
sprinkle
of
her
blood
directly
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
seven
times:
019:005
And
one
shall
burn
the
heifer
in
his
sight;
her
skin,
and
her
flesh,
and
her
blood,
with
her
dung,
shall
he
burn:
019:006
And
the
priest
shall
take
cedar
wood,
and
hyssop,
and
scarlet,
and
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
of
the
heifer.
019:007
Then
the
priest
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
he
shall
bathe
his
flesh
in
water,
and
afterward
he
shall
come
into
the
camp,
and
the
priest
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
019:008
And
he
that
burneth
her
shall
wash
his
clothes
in
water,
and
bathe
his
flesh
in
water,
and
shall
be
unclean
until
the
even.
019:009
And
a
man
that
is
clean
shall
gather
up
the
ashes
of
the
heifer,
and
lay
them
up
without
the
camp
in
a
clean
place,
and
it
shall
be
kept
for
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
for
a
water
of
separation:
it
is
a
purification
for
sin.
019:010
And
he
that
gathereth
the
ashes
of
the
heifer
shall
wash
his
clothes,
and
be
unclean
until
the
even:
and
it
shall
be
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
unto
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
them,
for
a
statute
for
ever.
019:011
He
that
toucheth
the
dead
body
of
any
man
shall
be
unclean
seven
days.
019:012
He
shall
purify
himself
with
it
on
the
third
day,
and
on
the
seventh
day
he
shall
be
clean:
but
if
he
purify
not
himself
the
third
day,
then
the
seventh
day
he
shall
not
be
clean.
019:013
Whosoever
toucheth
the
dead
body
of
any
man
that
is
dead,
and
purifieth
not
himself,
defileth
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD;
and
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
Israel:
because
the
water
of
separation
was
not
sprinkled
upon
him,
he
shall
be
unclean;
his
uncleanness
is
yet
upon
him.
019:014
This
is
the
law,
when
a
man
dieth
in
a
tent:
all
that
come
into
the
tent,
and
all
that
is
in
the
tent,
shall
be
unclean
seven
days.
019:015
And
every
open
vessel,
which
hath
no
covering
bound
upon
it,
is
unclean.
019:016
And
whosoever
toucheth
one
that
is
slain
with
a
sword
in
the
open
fields,
or
a
dead
body,
or
a
bone
of
a
man,
or
a
grave,
shall
be
unclean
seven
days.
019:017
And
for
an
unclean
person
they
shall
take
of
the
ashes
of
the
burnt
heifer
of
purification
for
sin,
and
running
water
shall
be
put
thereto
in
a
vessel:
019:018
And
a
clean
person
shall
take
hyssop,
and
dip
it
in
the
water,
and
sprinkle
it
upon
the
tent,
and
upon
all
the
vessels,
and
upon
the
persons
that
were
there,
and
upon
him
that
touched
a
bone,
or
one
slain,
or
one
dead,
or
a
grave:
019:019
And
the
clean
person
shall
sprinkle
upon
the
unclean
on
the
third
day,
and
on
the
seventh
day:
and
on
the
seventh
day
he
shall
purify
himself,
and
wash
his
clothes,
and
bathe
himself
in
water,
and
shall
be
clean
at
even.
019:020
But
the
man
that
shall
be
unclean,
and
shall
not
purify
himself,
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
the
congregation,
because
he
hath
defiled
the
sanctuary
of
the
LORD:
the
water
of
separation
hath
not
been
sprinkled
upon
him;
he
is
unclean.
019:021
And
it
shall
be
a
perpetual
statute
unto
them,
that
he
that
sprinkleth
the
water
of
separation
shall
wash
his
clothes;
and
he
that
toucheth
the
water
of
separation
shall
be
unclean
until
even.
019:022
And
whatsoever
the
unclean
person
toucheth
shall
be
unclean;
and
the
soul
that
toucheth
it
shall
be
unclean
until
even.
020:001
Then
came
the
children
of
Israel,
even
the
whole
congregation,
into
the
desert
of
Zin
in
the
first
month:
and
the
people
abode
in
Kadesh;
and
Miriam
died
there,
and
was
buried
there.
020:002
And
there
was
no
water
for
the
congregation:
and
they
gathered
themselves
together
against
Moses
and
against
Aaron.
020:003
And
the
people
chode
with
Moses,
and
spake,
saying,
Would
God
that
we
had
died
when
our
brethren
died
before
the
LORD!
020:004
And
why
have
ye
brought
up
the
congregation
of
the
LORD
into
this
wilderness,
that
we
and
our
cattle
should
die
there?
020:005
And
wherefore
have
ye
made
us
to
come
up
out
of
Egypt,
to
bring
us
in
unto
this
evil
place?
it
is
no
place
of
seed,
or
of
figs,
