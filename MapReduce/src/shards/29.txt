or
of
vines,
or
of
pomegranates;
neither
is
there
any
water
to
drink.
020:006
And
Moses
and
Aaron
went
from
the
presence
of
the
assembly
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
they
fell
upon
their
faces:
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
them.
020:007
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
020:008
Take
the
rod,
and
gather
thou
the
assembly
together,
thou,
and
Aaron
thy
brother,
and
speak
ye
unto
the
rock
before
their
eyes;
and
it
shall
give
forth
his
water,
and
thou
shalt
bring
forth
to
them
water
out
of
the
rock:
so
thou
shalt
give
the
congregation
and
their
beasts
drink.
020:009
And
Moses
took
the
rod
from
before
the
LORD,
as
he
commanded
him.
020:010
And
Moses
and
Aaron
gathered
the
congregation
together
before
the
rock,
and
he
said
unto
them,
Hear
now,
ye
rebels;
must
we
fetch
you
water
out
of
this
rock?
020:011
And
Moses
lifted
up
his
hand,
and
with
his
rod
he
smote
the
rock
twice:
and
the
water
came
out
abundantly,
and
the
congregation
drank,
and
their
beasts
also.
020:012
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
Aaron,
Because
ye
believed
me
not,
to
sanctify
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
children
of
Israel,
therefore
ye
shall
not
bring
this
congregation
into
the
land
which
I
have
given
them.
020:013
This
is
the
water
of
Meribah;
because
the
children
of
Israel
strove
with
the
LORD,
and
he
was
sanctified
in
them.
020:014
And
Moses
sent
messengers
from
Kadesh
unto
the
king
of
Edom,
Thus
saith
thy
brother
Israel,
Thou
knowest
all
the
travail
that
hath
befallen
us:
020:015
How
our
fathers
went
down
into
Egypt,
and
we
have
dwelt
in
Egypt
a
long
time;
and
the
Egyptians
vexed
us,
and
our
fathers:
020:016
And
when
we
cried
unto
the
LORD,
he
heard
our
voice,
and
sent
an
angel,
and
hath
brought
us
forth
out
of
Egypt:
and,
behold,
we
are
in
Kadesh,
a
city
in
the
uttermost
of
thy
border:
020:017
Let
us
pass,
I
pray
thee,
through
thy
country:
we
will
not
pass
through
the
fields,
or
through
the
vineyards,
neither
will
we
drink
of
the
water
of
the
wells:
we
will
go
by
the
king's
high
way,
we
will
not
turn
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left,
until
we
have
passed
thy
borders.
020:018
And
Edom
said
unto
him,
Thou
shalt
not
pass
by
me,
lest
I
come
out
against
thee
with
the
sword.
020:019
And
the
children
of
Israel
said
unto
him,
We
will
go
by
the
high
way:
and
if
I
and
my
cattle
drink
of
thy
water,
then
I
will
pay
for
it:
I
will
only,
without
doing
anything
else,
go
through
on
my
feet.
020:020
And
he
said,
Thou
shalt
not
go
through.
And
Edom
came
out
against
him
with
much
people,
and
with
a
strong
hand.
020:021
Thus
Edom
refused
to
give
Israel
passage
through
his
border:
wherefore
Israel
turned
away
from
him.
020:022
And
the
children
of
Israel,
even
the
whole
congregation,
journeyed
from
Kadesh,
and
came
unto
mount
Hor.
020:023
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
Aaron
in
mount
Hor,
by
the
coast
of
the
land
of
Edom,
saying,
020:024
Aaron
shall
be
gathered
unto
his
people:
for
he
shall
not
enter
into
the
land
which
I
have
given
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
because
ye
rebelled
against
my
word
at
the
water
of
Meribah.
020:025
Take
Aaron
and
Eleazar
his
son,
and
bring
them
up
unto
mount
Hor:
020:026
And
strip
Aaron
of
his
garments,
and
put
them
upon
Eleazar
his
son:
and
Aaron
shall
be
gathered
unto
his
people,
and
shall
die
there.
020:027
And
Moses
did
as
the
LORD
commanded:
and
they
went
up
into
mount
Hor
in
the
sight
of
all
the
congregation.
020:028
And
Moses
stripped
Aaron
of
his
garments,
and
put
them
upon
Eleazar
his
son;
and
Aaron
died
there
in
the
top
of
the
mount:
and
Moses
and
Eleazar
came
down
from
the
mount.
020:029
And
when
all
the
congregation
saw
that
Aaron
was
dead,
they
mourned
for
Aaron
thirty
days,
even
all
the
house
of
Israel.
021:001
And
when
king
Arad
the
Canaanite,
which
dwelt
in
the
south,
heard
tell
that
Israel
came
by
the
way
of
the
spies;
then
he
fought
against
Israel,
and
took
some
of
them
prisoners.
021:002
And
Israel
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
LORD,
and
said,
If
thou
wilt
indeed
deliver
this
people
into
my
hand,
then
I
will
utterly
destroy
their
cities.
021:003
And
the
LORD
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
Israel,
and
delivered
up
the
Canaanites;
and
they
utterly
destroyed
them
and
their
cities:
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
Hormah.
021:004
And
they
journeyed
from
mount
Hor
by
the
way
of
the
Red
sea,
to
compass
the
land
of
Edom:
and
the
soul
of
the
people
was
much
discouraged
because
of
the
way.
021:005
And
the
people
spake
against
God,
and
against
Moses,
Wherefore
have
ye
brought
us
up
out
of
Egypt
to
die
in
the
wilderness?
for
there
is
no
bread,
neither
is
there
any
water;
and
our
soul
loatheth
this
light
bread.
021:006
And
the
LORD
sent
fiery
serpents
among
the
people,
and
they
bit
the
people;
and
much
people
of
Israel
died.
021:007
Therefore
the
people
came
to
Moses,
and
said,
We
have
sinned,
for
we
have
spoken
against
the
LORD,
and
against
thee;
pray
unto
the
LORD,
that
he
take
away
the
serpents
from
us.
And
Moses
prayed
for
the
people.
021:008
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Make
thee
a
fiery
serpent,
and
set
it
upon
a
pole:
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
every
one
that
is
bitten,
when
he
looketh
upon
it,
shall
live.
021:009
And
Moses
made
a
serpent
of
brass,
and
put
it
upon
a
pole,
and
it
came
to
pass,
that
if
a
serpent
had
bitten
any
man,
when
he
beheld
the
serpent
of
brass,
he
lived.
021:010
And
the
children
of
Israel
set
forward,
and
pitched
in
Oboth.
021:011
And
they
journeyed
from
Oboth,
and
pitched
at
Ijeabarim,
in
the
wilderness
which
is
before
Moab,
toward
the
sunrising.
021:012
From
thence
they
removed,
and
pitched
in
the
valley
of
Zared.
021:013
From
thence
they
removed,
and
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
Arnon,
which
is
in
the
wilderness
that
cometh
out
of
the
coasts
of
the
Amorites:
for
Arnon
is
the
border
of
Moab,
between
Moab
and
the
Amorites.
021:014
Wherefore
it
is
said
in
the
book
of
the
wars
of
the
LORD,
What
he
did
in
the
Red
sea,
and
in
the
brooks
of
Arnon,
021:015
And
at
the
stream
of
the
brooks
that
goeth
down
to
the
dwelling
of
Ar,
and
lieth
upon
the
border
of
Moab.
021:016
And
from
thence
they
went
to
Beer:
that
is
the
well
whereof
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
Gather
the
people
together,
and
I
will
give
them
water.
021:017
Then
Israel
sang
this
song,
Spring
up,
O
well;
sing
ye
unto
it:
021:018
The
princes
digged
the
well,
the
nobles
of
the
people
digged
it,
by
the
direction
of
the
lawgiver,
with
their
staves.
And
from
the
wilderness
they
went
to
Mattanah:
021:019
And
from
Mattanah
to
Nahaliel:
and
from
Nahaliel
to
Bamoth:
021:020
And
from
Bamoth
in
the
valley,
that
is
in
the
country
of
Moab,
to
the
top
of
Pisgah,
which
looketh
toward
Jeshimon.
021:021
And
Israel
sent
messengers
unto
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
saying,
021:022
Let
me
pass
through
thy
land:
we
will
not
turn
into
the
fields,
or
into
the
vineyards;
we
will
not
drink
of
the
waters
of
the
well:
but
we
will
go
along
by
the
king's
high
way,
until
we
be
past
thy
borders.
021:023
And
Sihon
would
not
suffer
Israel
to
pass
through
his
border:
but
Sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together,
and
went
out
against
Israel
into
the
wilderness:
and
he
came
to
Jahaz,
and
fought
against
Israel.
021:024
And
Israel
smote
him
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
possessed
his
land
from
Arnon
unto
Jabbok,
even
unto
the
children
of
Ammon:
for
the
border
of
the
children
of
Ammon
was
strong.
021:025
And
Israel
took
all
these
cities:
and
Israel
dwelt
in
all
the
cities
of
the
Amorites,
in
Heshbon,
and
in
all
the
villages
thereof.
021:026
For
Heshbon
was
the
city
of
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites,
who
had
fought
against
the
former
king
of
Moab,
and
taken
all
his
land
out
of
his
hand,
even
unto
Arnon.
021:027
Wherefore
they
that
speak
in
proverbs
say,
Come
into
Heshbon,
let
the
city
of
Sihon
be
built
and
prepared:
021:028
For
there
is
a
fire
gone
out
of
Heshbon,
a
flame
from
the
city
of
Sihon:
it
hath
consumed
Ar
of
Moab,
and
the
lords
of
the
high
places
of
Arnon.
021:029
Woe
to
thee,
Moab!
thou
art
undone,
O
people
of
Chemosh:
he
hath
given
his
sons
that
escaped,
and
his
daughters,
into
captivity
unto
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites.
021:030
We
have
shot
at
them;
Heshbon
is
perished
even
unto
Dibon,
and
we
have
laid
them
waste
even
unto
Nophah,
which
reacheth
unto
Medeba.
021:031
Thus
Israel
dwelt
in
the
land
of
the
Amorites.
021:032
And
Moses
sent
to
spy
out
Jaazer,
and
they
took
the
villages
thereof,
and
drove
out
the
Amorites
that
were
there.
021:033
And
they
turned
and
went
up
by
the
way
of
Bashan:
and
Og
the
king
of
Bashan
went
out
against
them,
he,
and
all
his
people,
to
the
battle
at
Edrei.
021:034
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Fear
him
not:
for
I
have
delivered
him
into
thy
hand,
and
all
his
people,
and
his
land;
and
thou
shalt
do
to
him
as
thou
didst
unto
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
which
dwelt
at
Heshbon.
021:035
So
they
smote
him,
and
his
sons,
and
all
his
people,
until
there
was
none
left
him
alive:
and
they
possessed
his
land.
022:001
And
the
children
of
Israel
set
forward,
and
pitched
in
the
plains
of
Moab
on
this
side
Jordan
by
Jericho.
022:002
And
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor
saw
all
that
Israel
had
done
to
the
Amorites.
022:003
And
Moab
was
sore
afraid
of
the
people,
because
they
were
many:
and
Moab
was
distressed
because
of
the
children
of
Israel.
022:004
And
Moab
said
unto
the
elders
of
Midian,
Now
shall
this
company
lick
up
all
that
are
round
about
us,
as
the
ox
licketh
up
the
grass
of
the
field.
And
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor
was
king
of
the
Moabites
at
that
time.
022:005
He
sent
messengers
therefore
unto
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
to
Pethor,
which
is
by
the
river
of
the
land
of
the
children
of
his
people,
to
call
him,
saying,
Behold,
there
is
a
people
come
out
from
Egypt:
behold,
they
cover
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
they
abide
over
against
me:
022:006
Come
now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
curse
me
this
people;
for
they
are
too
mighty
for
me:
peradventure
I
shall
prevail,
that
we
may
smite
them,
and
that
I
may
drive
them
out
of
the
land:
for
I
wot
that
he
whom
thou
blessest
is
blessed,
and
he
whom
thou
cursest
is
cursed.
022:007
And
the
elders
of
Moab
and
the
elders
of
Midian
departed
with
the
rewards
of
divination
in
their
hand;
and
they
came
unto
Balaam,
and
spake
unto
him
the
words
of
Balak.
022:008
And
he
said
unto
them,
Lodge
here
this
night,
and
I
will
bring
you
word
again,
as
the
LORD
shall
speak
unto
me:
and
the
princes
of
Moab
abode
with
Balaam.
022:009
And
God
came
unto
Balaam,
and
said,
What
men
are
these
with
thee?
022:010
And
Balaam
said
unto
God,
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor,
king
of
Moab,
hath
sent
unto
me,
saying,
022:011
Behold,
there
is
a
people
come
out
of
Egypt,
which
covereth
the
face
of
the
earth:
come
now,
curse
me
them;
peradventure
I
shall
be
able
to
overcome
them,
and
drive
them
out.
022:012
And
God
said
unto
Balaam,
Thou
shalt
not
go
with
them;
thou
shalt
not
curse
the
people:
for
they
are
blessed.
022:013
And
Balaam
rose
up
in
the
morning,
and
said
unto
the
princes
of
Balak,
Get
you
into
your
land:
for
the
LORD
refuseth
to
give
me
leave
to
go
with
you.
022:014
And
the
princes
of
Moab
rose
up,
and
they
went
unto
Balak,
and
said,
Balaam
refuseth
to
come
with
us.
022:015
And
Balak
sent
yet
again
princes,
more,
and
more
honourable
than
they.
022:016
And
they
came
to
Balaam,
and
said
to
him,
Thus
saith
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor,
Let
nothing,
I
pray
thee,
hinder
thee
from
coming
unto
me:
022:017
For
I
will
promote
thee
unto
very
great
honour,
and
I
will
do
whatsoever
thou
sayest
unto
me:
come
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
curse
me
this
people.
022:018
And
Balaam
answered
and
said
unto
the
servants
of
Balak,
If
Balak
would
give
me
his
house
full
of
silver
and
gold,
I
cannot
go
beyond
the
word
of
the
LORD
my
God,
to
do
less
or
more.
022:019
Now
therefore,
I
pray
you,
tarry
ye
also
here
this
night,
that
I
may
know
what
the
LORD
will
say
unto
me
more.
022:020
And
God
came
unto
Balaam
at
night,
and
said
unto
him,
If
the
men
come
to
call
thee,
rise
up,
and
go
with
them;
but
yet
the
word
which
I
shall
say
unto
thee,
that
shalt
thou
do.
022:021
And
Balaam
rose
up
in
the
morning,
and
saddled
his
ass,
and
went
with
the
princes
of
Moab.
022:022
And
God's
anger
was
kindled
because
he
went:
and
the
angel
of
the
LORD
stood
in
the
way
for
an
adversary
against
him.
Now
he
was
riding
upon
his
ass,
and
his
two
servants
were
with
him.
022:023
And
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
LORD
standing
in
the
way,
and
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand:
and
the
ass
turned
aside
out
of
the
way,
and
went
into
the
field:
and
Balaam
smote
the
ass,
to
turn
her
into
the
way.
022:024
But
the
angel
of
the
LORD
stood
in
a
path
of
the
vineyards,
a
wall
being
on
this
side,
and
a
wall
on
that
side.
022:025
And
when
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
LORD,
she
thrust
herself
unto
the
wall,
and
crushed
Balaam's
foot
against
the
wall:
and
he
smote
her
again.
022:026
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
went
further,
and
stood
in
a
narrow
place,
where
was
no
way
to
turn
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left.
022:027
And
when
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
LORD,
she
fell
down
under
Balaam:
and
Balaam's
anger
was
kindled,
and
he
smote
the
ass
with
a
staff.
022:028
And
the
LORD
opened
the
mouth
of
the
ass,
and
she
said
unto
Balaam,
What
have
I
done
unto
thee,
that
thou
hast
smitten
me
these
three
times?
022:029
And
Balaam
said
unto
the
ass,
Because
thou
hast
mocked
me:
I
would
there
were
a
sword
in
mine
hand,
for
now
would
I
kill
thee.
022:030
And
the
ass
said
unto
Balaam,
Am
not
I
thine
ass,
upon
which
thou
hast
ridden
ever
since
I
was
thine
unto
this
day?
was
I
ever
wont
to
do
so
unto
thee?
And
he
said,
Nay.
022:031
Then
the
LORD
opened
the
eyes
of
Balaam,
and
he
saw
the
angel
of
the
LORD
standing
in
the
way,
and
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand:
and
he
bowed
down
his
head,
and
fell
flat
on
his
face.
022:032
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Wherefore
hast
thou
smitten
thine
ass
these
three
times?
behold,
I
went
out
to
withstand
thee,
because
thy
way
is
perverse
before
me:
022:033
And
the
ass
saw
me,
and
turned
from
me
these
three
times:
unless
she
had
turned
from
me,
surely
now
also
I
had
slain
thee,
and
saved
her
alive.
022:034
And
Balaam
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
LORD,
I
have
sinned;
for
I
knew
not
that
thou
stoodest
in
the
way
against
me:
now
therefore,
if
it
displease
thee,
I
will
get
me
back
again.
022:035
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
Balaam,
Go
with
the
men:
but
only
the
word
that
I
shall
speak
unto
thee,
that
thou
shalt
speak.
So
Balaam
went
with
the
princes
of
Balak.
022:036
And
when
Balak
heard
that
Balaam
was
come,
he
went
out
to
meet
him
unto
a
city
of
Moab,
which
is
in
the
border
of
Arnon,
which
is
in
the
utmost
coast.
022:037
And
Balak
said
unto
Balaam,
Did
I
not
earnestly
send
unto
thee
to
call
thee?
wherefore
camest
thou
not
unto
me?
am
I
not
able
indeed
to
promote
thee
to
honour?
022:038
And
Balaam
said
unto
Balak,
Lo,
I
am
come
unto
thee:
have
I
now
any
power
at
all
to
say
any
thing?
the
word
that
God
putteth
in
my
mouth,
that
shall
I
speak.
022:039
And
Balaam
went
with
Balak,
and
they
came
unto
Kirjathhuzoth.
022:040
And
Balak
offered
oxen
and
sheep,
and
sent
to
Balaam,
and
to
the
princes
that
were
with
him.
022:041
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
Balak
took
Balaam,
and
brought
him
up
into
the
high
places
of
Baal,
that
thence
he
might
see
the
utmost
part
of
the
people.
023:001
And
Balaam
said
unto
Balak,
Build
me
here
seven
altars,
and
prepare
me
here
seven
oxen
and
seven
rams.
023:002
And
Balak
did
as
Balaam
had
spoken;
and
Balak
and
Balaam
offered
on
every
altar
a
bullock
and
a
ram.
023:003
And
Balaam
said
unto
Balak,
Stand
by
thy
burnt
offering,
and
I
will
go:
peradventure
the
LORD
will
come
to
meet
me:
and
whatsoever
he
sheweth
me
I
will
tell
thee.
And
he
went
to
an
high
place.
023:004
And
God
met
Balaam:
and
he
said
unto
him,
I
have
prepared
seven
altars,
and
I
have
offered
upon
every
altar
a
bullock
and
a
ram.
023:005
And
the
LORD
put
a
word
in
Balaam's
mouth,
and
said,
Return
unto
Balak,
and
thus
thou
shalt
speak.
023:006
And
he
returned
unto
him,
and,
lo,
he
stood
by
his
burnt
sacrifice,
he,
and
all
the
princes
of
Moab.
023:007
And
he
took
up
his
parable,
and
said,
Balak
the
king
of
Moab
hath
brought
me
from
Aram,
out
of
the
mountains
of
the
east,
saying,
Come,
curse
me
Jacob,
and
come,
defy
Israel.
023:008
How
shall
I
curse,
whom
God
hath
not
cursed?
or
how
shall
I
defy,
whom
the
LORD
hath
not
defied?
023:009
For
from
the
top
of
the
rocks
I
see
him,
and
from
the
hills
I
behold
him:
lo,
the
people
shall
dwell
alone,
and
shall
not
be
reckoned
among
the
nations.
023:010
Who
can
count
the
dust
of
Jacob,
and
the
number
of
the
fourth
part
of
Israel?
Let
me
die
the
death
of
the
righteous,
and
let
my
last
end
be
like
his!
023:011
And
Balak
said
unto
Balaam,
What
hast
thou
done
unto
me?
I
took
thee
to
curse
mine
enemies,
and,
behold,
thou
hast
blessed
them
altogether.
023:012
And
he
answered
and
said,
Must
I
not
take
heed
to
speak
that
which
the
LORD
hath
put
in
my
mouth?
023:013
And
Balak
said
unto
him,
Come,
I
pray
thee,
with
me
unto
another
place,
from
whence
thou
mayest
see
them:
thou
shalt
see
but
the
utmost
part
of
them,
and
shalt
not
see
them
all:
and
curse
me
them
from
thence.
023:014
And
he
brought
him
into
the
field
of
Zophim,
to
the
top
of
Pisgah,
and
built
seven
altars,
and
offered
a
bullock
and
a
ram
on
every
altar.
023:015
And
he
said
unto
Balak,
Stand
here
by
thy
burnt
offering,
while
I
meet
the
LORD
yonder.
023:016
And
the
LORD
met
Balaam,
and
put
a
word
in
his
mouth,
and
said,
Go
again
unto
Balak,
and
say
thus.
023:017
And
when
he
came
to
him,
behold,
he
stood
by
his
burnt
offering,
and
the
princes
of
Moab
with
him.
And
Balak
said
unto
him,
What
hath
the
LORD
spoken?
023:018
And
he
took
up
his
parable,
and
said,
Rise
up,
Balak,
and
hear;
hearken
unto
me,
thou
son
of
Zippor:
023:019
God
is
not
a
man,
that
he
should
lie;
neither
the
son
of
man,
that
he
should
repent:
hath
he
said,
and
shall
he
not
do
it?
or
hath
he
spoken,
and
shall
he
not
make
it
good?
023:020
Behold,
I
have
received
commandment
to
bless:
and
he
hath
blessed;
and
I
cannot
reverse
it.
023:021
He
hath
not
beheld
iniquity
in
Jacob,
neither
hath
he
seen
perverseness
in
Israel:
the
LORD
his
God
is
with
him,
and
the
shout
of
a
king
is
among
them.
023:022
God
brought
them
out
of
Egypt;
he
hath
as
it
were
the
strength
of
an
unicorn.
023:023
Surely
there
is
no
enchantment
against
Jacob,
neither
is
there
any
divination
against
Israel:
according
to
this
time
it
shall
be
said
of
Jacob
and
of
Israel,
What
hath
God
wrought!
023:024
Behold,
the
people
shall
rise
up
as
a
great
lion,
and
lift
up
himself
as
a
young
lion:
he
shall
not
lie
down
until
he
eat
of
the
prey,
and
drink
the
blood
of
the
slain.
023:025
And
Balak
said
unto
Balaam,
Neither
curse
them
at
all,
nor
bless
them
at
all.
023:026
But
Balaam
answered
and
said
unto
Balak,
Told
not
I
thee,
saying,
All
that
the
LORD
speaketh,
that
I
must
do?
023:027
And
Balak
said
unto
Balaam,
Come,
I
pray
thee,
I
will
bring
thee
unto
another
place;
peradventure
it
will
please
God
that
thou
mayest
curse
me
them
from
thence.
023:028
And
Balak
brought
Balaam
unto
the
top
of
Peor,
that
looketh
toward
Jeshimon.
023:029
And
Balaam
said
unto
Balak,
Build
me
here
seven
altars,
and
prepare
me
here
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams.
023:030
And
Balak
did
as
Balaam
had
said,
and
offered
a
bullock
and
a
ram
on
every
altar.
024:001
And
when
Balaam
saw
that
it
pleased
the
LORD
to
bless
Israel,
he
went
not,
as
at
other
times,
to
seek
for
enchantments,
but
he
set
his
face
toward
the
wilderness.
024:002
And
Balaam
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
he
saw
Israel
abiding
in
his
tents
according
to
their
tribes;
and
the
spirit
of
God
came
upon
him.
024:003
And
he
took
up
his
parable,
and
said,
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
hath
said,
and
the
man
whose
eyes
are
open
hath
said:
024:004
He
hath
said,
which
heard
the
words
of
God,
which
saw
the
vision
of
the
Almighty,
falling
into
a
trance,
but
having
his
eyes
open:
024:005
How
goodly
are
thy
tents,
O
Jacob,
and
thy
tabernacles,
O
Israel!
024:006
As
the
valleys
are
they
spread
forth,
as
gardens
by
the
river's
side,
as
the
trees
of
lign
aloes
which
the
LORD
hath
planted,
and
as
cedar
trees
beside
the
waters.
024:007
He
shall
pour
the
water
out
of
his
buckets,
and
his
seed
shall
be
in
many
waters,
and
his
king
shall
be
higher
than
Agag,
and
his
kingdom
shall
be
exalted.
024:008
God
brought
him
forth
out
of
Egypt;
he
hath
as
it
were
the
strength
of
an
unicorn:
he
shall
eat
up
the
nations
his
enemies,
and
shall
break
their
bones,
and
pierce
them
through
with
his
arrows.
024:009
He
couched,
he
lay
down
as
a
lion,
and
as
a
great
lion:
who
shall
stir
him
up?
Blessed
is
he
that
blesseth
thee,
and
cursed
is
he
that
curseth
thee.
024:010
And
Balak's
anger
was
kindled
against
Balaam,
and
he
smote
his
hands
together:
and
Balak
said
unto
Balaam,
I
called
thee
to
curse
mine
enemies,
and,
behold,
thou
hast
altogether
blessed
them
these
three
times.
024:011
Therefore
now
flee
thou
to
thy
place:
I
thought
to
promote
thee
unto
great
honour;
but,
lo,
the
LORD
hath
kept
thee
back
from
honour.
024:012
And
Balaam
said
unto
Balak,
Spake
I
not
also
to
thy
messengers
which
thou
sentest
unto
me,
saying,
024:013
If
Balak
would
give
me
his
house
full
of
silver
and
gold,
I
cannot
go
beyond
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
to
do
either
good
or
bad
of
mine
own
mind;
but
what
the
LORD
saith,
that
will
I
speak?
024:014
And
now,
behold,
I
go
unto
my
people:
come
therefore,
and
I
will
advertise
thee
what
this
people
shall
do
to
thy
people
in
the
latter
days.
024:015
And
he
took
up
his
parable,
and
said,
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
hath
said,
and
