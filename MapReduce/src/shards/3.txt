smoke
of
the
country
went
up
as
the
smoke
of
a
furnace.
019:029
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
God
destroyed
the
cities
of
the
plain,
that
God
remembered
Abraham,
and
sent
Lot
out
of
the
midst
of
the
overthrow,
when
he
overthrew
the
cities
in
the
which
Lot
dwelt.
019:030
And
Lot
went
up
out
of
Zoar,
and
dwelt
in
the
mountain,
and
his
two
daughters
with
him;
for
he
feared
to
dwell
in
Zoar:
and
he
dwelt
in
a
cave,
he
and
his
two
daughters.
019:031
And
the
firstborn
said
unto
the
younger,
Our
father
is
old,
and
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
earth
to
come
in
unto
us
after
the
manner
of
all
the
earth:
019:032
Come,
let
us
make
our
father
drink
wine,
and
we
will
lie
with
him,
that
we
may
preserve
seed
of
our
father.
019:033
And
they
made
their
father
drink
wine
that
night:
and
the
firstborn
went
in,
and
lay
with
her
father;
and
he
perceived
not
when
she
lay
down,
nor
when
she
arose.
019:034
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
the
firstborn
said
unto
the
younger,
Behold,
I
lay
yesternight
with
my
father:
let
us
make
him
drink
wine
this
night
also;
and
go
thou
in,
and
lie
with
him,
that
we
may
preserve
seed
of
our
father.
019:035
And
they
made
their
father
drink
wine
that
night
also:
and
the
younger
arose,
and
lay
with
him;
and
he
perceived
not
when
she
lay
down,
nor
when
she
arose.
019:036
Thus
were
both
the
daughters
of
Lot
with
child
by
their
father.
019:037
And
the
first
born
bare
a
son,
and
called
his
name
Moab:
the
same
is
the
father
of
the
Moabites
unto
this
day.
019:038
And
the
younger,
she
also
bare
a
son,
and
called
his
name
Benammi:
the
same
is
the
father
of
the
children
of
Ammon
unto
this
day.
020:001
And
Abraham
journeyed
from
thence
toward
the
south
country,
and
dwelled
between
Kadesh
and
Shur,
and
sojourned
in
Gerar.
020:002
And
Abraham
said
of
Sarah
his
wife,
She
is
my
sister:
and
Abimelech
king
of
Gerar
sent,
and
took
Sarah.
020:003
But
God
came
to
Abimelech
in
a
dream
by
night,
and
said
to
him,
Behold,
thou
art
but
a
dead
man,
for
the
woman
which
thou
hast
taken;
for
she
is
a
man's
wife.
020:004
But
Abimelech
had
not
come
near
her:
and
he
said,
LORD,
wilt
thou
slay
also
a
righteous
nation?
020:005
Said
he
not
unto
me,
She
is
my
sister?
and
she,
even
she
herself
said,
He
is
my
brother:
in
the
integrity
of
my
heart
and
innocency
of
my
hands
have
I
done
this.
020:006
And
God
said
unto
him
in
a
dream,
Yea,
I
know
that
thou
didst
this
in
the
integrity
of
thy
heart;
for
I
also
withheld
thee
from
sinning
against
me:
therefore
suffered
I
thee
not
to
touch
her.
020:007
Now
therefore
restore
the
man
his
wife;
for
he
is
a
prophet,
and
he
shall
pray
for
thee,
and
thou
shalt
live:
and
if
thou
restore
her
not,
know
thou
that
thou
shalt
surely
die,
thou,
and
all
that
are
thine.
020:008
Therefore
Abimelech
rose
early
in
the
morning,
and
called
all
his
servants,
and
told
all
these
things
in
their
ears:
and
the
men
were
sore
afraid.
020:009
Then
Abimelech
called
Abraham,
and
said
unto
him,
What
hast
thou
done
unto
us?
and
what
have
I
offended
thee,
that
thou
hast
brought
on
me
and
on
my
kingdom
a
great
sin?
thou
hast
done
deeds
unto
me
that
ought
not
to
be
done.
020:010
And
Abimelech
said
unto
Abraham,
What
sawest
thou,
that
thou
hast
done
this
thing?
020:011
And
Abraham
said,
Because
I
thought,
Surely
the
fear
of
God
is
not
in
this
place;
and
they
will
slay
me
for
my
wife's
sake.
020:012
And
yet
indeed
she
is
my
sister;
she
is
the
daughter
of
my
father,
but
not
the
daughter
of
my
mother;
and
she
became
my
wife.
020:013
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
God
caused
me
to
wander
from
my
father's
house,
that
I
said
unto
her,
This
is
thy
kindness
which
thou
shalt
shew
unto
me;
at
every
place
whither
we
shall
come,
say
of
me,
He
is
my
brother.
020:014
And
Abimelech
took
sheep,
and
oxen,
and
menservants,
and
womenservants,
and
gave
them
unto
Abraham,
and
restored
him
Sarah
his
wife.
020:015
And
Abimelech
said,
Behold,
my
land
is
before
thee:
dwell
where
it
pleaseth
thee.
020:016
And
unto
Sarah
he
said,
Behold,
I
have
given
thy
brother
a
thousand
pieces
of
silver:
behold,
he
is
to
thee
a
covering
of
the
eyes,
unto
all
that
are
with
thee,
and
with
all
other:
thus
she
was
reproved.
020:017
So
Abraham
prayed
unto
God:
and
God
healed
Abimelech,
and
his
wife,
and
his
maidservants;
and
they
bare
children.
020:018
For
the
LORD
had
fast
closed
up
all
the
wombs
of
the
house
of
Abimelech,
because
of
Sarah
Abraham's
wife.
021:001
And
the
LORD
visited
Sarah
as
he
had
said,
and
the
LORD
did
unto
Sarah
as
he
had
spoken.
021:002
For
Sarah
conceived,
and
bare
Abraham
a
son
in
his
old
age,
at
the
set
time
of
which
God
had
spoken
to
him.
021:003
And
Abraham
called
the
name
of
his
son
that
was
born
unto
him,
whom
Sarah
bare
to
him,
Isaac.
021:004
And
Abraham
circumcised
his
son
Isaac
being
eight
days
old,
as
God
had
commanded
him.
021:005
And
Abraham
was
an
hundred
years
old,
when
his
son
Isaac
was
born
unto
him.
021:006
And
Sarah
said,
God
hath
made
me
to
laugh,
so
that
all
that
hear
will
laugh
with
me.
021:007
And
she
said,
Who
would
have
said
unto
Abraham,
that
Sarah
should
have
given
children
suck?
for
I
have
born
him
a
son
in
his
old
age.
021:008
And
the
child
grew,
and
was
weaned:
and
Abraham
made
a
great
feast
the
same
day
that
Isaac
was
weaned.
021:009
And
Sarah
saw
the
son
of
Hagar
the
Egyptian,
which
she
had
born
unto
Abraham,
mocking.
021:010
Wherefore
she
said
unto
Abraham,
Cast
out
this
bondwoman
and
her
son:
for
the
son
of
this
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
my
son,
even
with
Isaac.
021:011
And
the
thing
was
very
grievous
in
Abraham's
sight
because
of
his
son.
021:012
And
God
said
unto
Abraham,
Let
it
not
be
grievous
in
thy
sight
because
of
the
lad,
and
because
of
thy
bondwoman;
in
all
that
Sarah
hath
said
unto
thee,
hearken
unto
her
voice;
for
in
Isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called.
021:013
And
also
of
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
will
I
make
a
nation,
because
he
is
thy
seed.
021:014
And
Abraham
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
took
bread,
and
a
bottle
of
water,
and
gave
it
unto
Hagar,
putting
it
on
her
shoulder,
and
the
child,
and
sent
her
away:
and
she
departed,
and
wandered
in
the
wilderness
of
Beersheba.
021:015
And
the
water
was
spent
in
the
bottle,
and
she
cast
the
child
under
one
of
the
shrubs.
021:016
And
she
went,
and
sat
her
down
over
against
him
a
good
way
off,
as
it
were
a
bow
shot:
for
she
said,
Let
me
not
see
the
death
of
the
child.
And
she
sat
over
against
him,
and
lift
up
her
voice,
and
wept.
021:017
And
God
heard
the
voice
of
the
lad;
and
the
angel
of
God
called
to
Hagar
out
of
heaven,
and
said
unto
her,
What
aileth
thee,
Hagar?
fear
not;
for
God
hath
heard
the
voice
of
the
lad
where
he
is.
021:018
Arise,
lift
up
the
lad,
and
hold
him
in
thine
hand;
for
I
will
make
him
a
great
nation.
021:019
And
God
opened
her
eyes,
and
she
saw
a
well
of
water;
and
she
went,
and
filled
the
bottle
with
water,
and
gave
the
lad
drink.
021:020
And
God
was
with
the
lad;
and
he
grew,
and
dwelt
in
the
wilderness,
and
became
an
archer.
021:021
And
he
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
of
Paran:
and
his
mother
took
him
a
wife
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
021:022
And
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time,
that
Abimelech
and
Phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
host
spake
unto
Abraham,
saying,
God
is
with
thee
in
all
that
thou
doest:
021:023
Now
therefore
swear
unto
me
here
by
God
that
thou
wilt
not
deal
falsely
with
me,
nor
with
my
son,
nor
with
my
son's
son:
but
according
to
the
kindness
that
I
have
done
unto
thee,
thou
shalt
do
unto
me,
and
to
the
land
wherein
thou
hast
sojourned.
021:024
And
Abraham
said,
I
will
swear.
021:025
And
Abraham
reproved
Abimelech
because
of
a
well
of
water,
which
Abimelech's
servants
had
violently
taken
away.
021:026
And
Abimelech
said,
I
wot
not
who
hath
done
this
thing;
neither
didst
thou
tell
me,
neither
yet
heard
I
of
it,
but
to
day.
021:027
And
Abraham
took
sheep
and
oxen,
and
gave
them
unto
Abimelech;
and
both
of
them
made
a
covenant.
021:028
And
Abraham
set
seven
ewe
lambs
of
the
flock
by
themselves.
021:029
And
Abimelech
said
unto
Abraham,
What
mean
these
seven
ewe
lambs
which
thou
hast
set
by
themselves?
021:030
And
he
said,
For
these
seven
ewe
lambs
shalt
thou
take
of
my
hand,
that
they
may
be
a
witness
unto
me,
that
I
have
digged
this
well.
021:031
Wherefore
he
called
that
place
Beersheba;
because
there
they
sware
both
of
them.
021:032
Thus
they
made
a
covenant
at
Beersheba:
then
Abimelech
rose
up,
and
Phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
host,
and
they
returned
into
the
land
of
the
Philistines.
021:033
And
Abraham
planted
a
grove
in
Beersheba,
and
called
there
on
the
name
of
the
LORD,
the
everlasting
God.
021:034
And
Abraham
sojourned
in
the
Philistines'
land
many
days.
022:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things,
that
God
did
tempt
Abraham,
and
said
unto
him,
Abraham:
and
he
said,
Behold,
here
I
am.
022:002
And
he
said,
Take
now
thy
son,
thine
only
son
Isaac,
whom
thou
lovest,
and
get
thee
into
the
land
of
Moriah;
and
offer
him
there
for
a
burnt
offering
upon
one
of
the
mountains
which
I
will
tell
thee
of.
022:003
And
Abraham
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
saddled
his
ass,
and
took
two
of
his
young
men
with
him,
and
Isaac
his
son,
and
clave
the
wood
for
the
burnt
offering,
and
rose
up,
and
went
unto
the
place
of
which
God
had
told
him.
022:004
Then
on
the
third
day
Abraham
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
saw
the
place
afar
off.
022:005
And
Abraham
said
unto
his
young
men,
Abide
ye
here
with
the
ass;
and
I
and
the
lad
will
go
yonder
and
worship,
and
come
again
to
you.
022:006
And
Abraham
took
the
wood
of
the
burnt
offering,
and
laid
it
upon
Isaac
his
son;
and
he
took
the
fire
in
his
hand,
and
a
knife;
and
they
went
both
of
them
together.
022:007
And
Isaac
spake
unto
Abraham
his
father,
and
said,
My
father:
and
he
said,
Here
am
I,
my
son.
And
he
said,
Behold
the
fire
and
the
wood:
but
where
is
the
lamb
for
a
burnt
offering?
022:008
And
Abraham
said,
My
son,
God
will
provide
himself
a
lamb
for
a
burnt
offering:
so
they
went
both
of
them
together.
022:009
And
they
came
to
the
place
which
God
had
told
him
of;
and
Abraham
built
an
altar
there,
and
laid
the
wood
in
order,
and
bound
Isaac
his
son,
and
laid
him
on
the
altar
upon
the
wood.
022:010
And
Abraham
stretched
forth
his
hand,
and
took
the
knife
to
slay
his
son.
022:011
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
called
unto
him
out
of
heaven,
and
said,
Abraham,
Abraham:
and
he
said,
Here
am
I.
022:012
And
he
said,
Lay
not
thine
hand
upon
the
lad,
neither
do
thou
any
thing
unto
him:
for
now
I
know
that
thou
fearest
God,
seeing
thou
hast
not
withheld
thy
son,
thine
only
son
from
me.
022:013
And
Abraham
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
looked,
and
behold
behind
him
a
ram
caught
in
a
thicket
by
his
horns:
and
Abraham
went
and
took
the
ram,
and
offered
him
up
for
a
burnt
offering
in
the
stead
of
his
son.
022:014
And
Abraham
called
the
name
of
that
place
Jehovahjireh:
as
it
is
said
to
this
day,
In
the
mount
of
the
LORD
it
shall
be
seen.
022:015
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
called
unto
Abraham
out
of
heaven
the
second
time,
022:016
And
said,
By
myself
have
I
sworn,
saith
the
LORD,
for
because
thou
hast
done
this
thing,
and
hast
not
withheld
thy
son,
thine
only
son:
022:017
That
in
blessing
I
will
bless
thee,
and
in
multiplying
I
will
multiply
thy
seed
as
the
stars
of
the
heaven,
and
as
the
sand
which
is
upon
the
sea
shore;
and
thy
seed
shall
possess
the
gate
of
his
enemies;
022:018
And
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed;
because
thou
hast
obeyed
my
voice.
022:019
So
Abraham
returned
unto
his
young
men,
and
they
rose
up
and
went
together
to
Beersheba;
and
Abraham
dwelt
at
Beersheba.
022:020
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things,
that
it
was
told
Abraham,
saying,
Behold,
Milcah,
she
hath
also
born
children
unto
thy
brother
Nahor;
022:021
Huz
his
firstborn,
and
Buz
his
brother,
and
Kemuel
the
father
of
Aram,
022:022
And
Chesed,
and
Hazo,
and
Pildash,
and
Jidlaph,
and
Bethuel.
022:023
And
Bethuel
begat
Rebekah:
these
eight
Milcah
did
bear
to
Nahor,
Abraham's
brother.
022:024
And
his
concubine,
whose
name
was
Reumah,
she
bare
also
Tebah,
and
Gaham,
and
Thahash,
and
Maachah.
023:001
And
Sarah
was
an
hundred
and
seven
and
twenty
years
old:
these
were
the
years
of
the
life
of
Sarah.
023:002
And
Sarah
died
in
Kirjatharba;
the
same
is
Hebron
in
the
land
of
Canaan:
and
Abraham
came
to
mourn
for
Sarah,
and
to
weep
for
her.
023:003
And
Abraham
stood
up
from
before
his
dead,
and
spake
unto
the
sons
of
Heth,
saying,
023:004
I
am
a
stranger
and
a
sojourner
with
you:
give
me
a
possession
of
a
buryingplace
with
you,
that
I
may
bury
my
dead
out
of
my
sight.
023:005
And
the
children
of
Heth
answered
Abraham,
saying
unto
him,
023:006
Hear
us,
my
lord:
thou
art
a
mighty
prince
among
us:
in
the
choice
of
our
sepulchres
bury
thy
dead;
none
of
us
shall
withhold
from
thee
his
sepulchre,
but
that
thou
mayest
bury
thy
dead.
023:007
And
Abraham
stood
up,
and
bowed
himself
to
the
people
of
the
land,
even
to
the
children
of
Heth.
023:008
And
he
communed
with
them,
saying,
If
it
be
your
mind
that
I
should
bury
my
dead
out
of
my
sight;
hear
me,
and
intreat
for
me
to
Ephron
the
son
of
Zohar,
023:009
That
he
may
give
me
the
cave
of
Machpelah,
which
he
hath,
which
is
in
the
end
of
his
field;
for
as
much
money
as
it
is
worth
he
shall
give
it
me
for
a
possession
of
a
buryingplace
amongst
you.
023:010
And
Ephron
dwelt
among
the
children
of
Heth:
and
Ephron
the
Hittite
answered
Abraham
in
the
audience
of
the
children
of
Heth,
even
of
all
that
went
in
at
the
gate
of
his
city,
saying,
023:011
Nay,
my
lord,
hear
me:
the
field
give
I
thee,
and
the
cave
that
is
therein,
I
give
it
thee;
in
the
presence
of
the
sons
of
my
people
give
I
it
thee:
bury
thy
dead.
023:012
And
Abraham
bowed
down
himself
before
the
people
of
the
land.
023:013
And
he
spake
unto
Ephron
in
the
audience
of
the
people
of
the
land,
saying,
But
if
thou
wilt
give
it,
I
pray
thee,
hear
me:
I
will
give
thee
money
for
the
field;
take
it
of
me,
and
I
will
bury
my
dead
there.
023:014
And
Ephron
answered
Abraham,
saying
unto
him,
023:015
My
lord,
hearken
unto
me:
the
land
is
worth
four
hundred
shekels
of
silver;
what
is
that
betwixt
me
and
thee?
bury
therefore
thy
dead.
023:016
And
Abraham
hearkened
unto
Ephron;
and
Abraham
weighed
to
Ephron
the
silver,
which
he
had
named
in
the
audience
of
the
sons
of
Heth,
four
hundred
shekels
of
silver,
current
money
with
the
merchant.
023:017
And
the
field
of
Ephron
which
was
in
Machpelah,
which
was
before
Mamre,
the
field,
and
the
cave
which
was
therein,
and
all
the
trees
that
were
in
the
field,
that
were
in
all
the
borders
round
about,
were
made
sure
023:018
Unto
Abraham
for
a
possession
in
the
presence
of
the
children
of
Heth,
before
all
that
went
in
at
the
gate
of
his
city.
023:019
And
after
this,
Abraham
buried
Sarah
his
wife
in
the
cave
of
the
field
of
Machpelah
before
Mamre:
the
same
is
Hebron
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
023:020
And
the
field,
and
the
cave
that
is
therein,
were
made
sure
unto
Abraham
for
a
possession
of
a
buryingplace
by
the
sons
of
Heth.
024:001
And
Abraham
was
old,
and
well
stricken
in
age:
and
the
LORD
had
blessed
Abraham
in
all
things.
024:002
And
Abraham
said
unto
his
eldest
servant
of
his
house,
that
ruled
over
all
that
he
had,
Put,
I
pray
thee,
thy
hand
under
my
thigh:
024:003
And
I
will
make
thee
swear
by
the
LORD,
the
God
of
heaven,
and
the
God
of
the
earth,
that
thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
unto
my
son
of
the
daughters
of
the
Canaanites,
among
whom
I
dwell:
024:004
But
thou
shalt
go
unto
my
country,
and
to
my
kindred,
and
take
a
wife
unto
my
son
Isaac.
024:005
And
the
servant
said
unto
him,
Peradventure
the
woman
will
not
be
willing
to
follow
me
unto
this
land:
must
I
needs
bring
thy
son
again
unto
the
land
from
whence
thou
camest?
024:006
And
Abraham
said
unto
him,
Beware
thou
that
thou
bring
not
my
son
thither
again.
024:007
The
LORD
God
of
heaven,
which
took
me
from
my
father's
house,
and
from
the
land
of
my
kindred,
and
which
spake
unto
me,
and
that
sware
unto
me,
saying,
Unto
thy
seed
will
I
give
this
land;
he
shall
send
his
angel
before
thee,
and
thou
shalt
take
a
wife
unto
my
son
from
thence.
024:008
And
if
the
woman
will
not
be
willing
to
follow
thee,
then
thou
shalt
be
clear
from
this
my
oath:
only
bring
not
my
son
thither
again.
024:009
And
the
servant
put
his
hand
under
the
thigh
of
Abraham
his
master,
and
sware
to
him
concerning
that
matter.
024:010
And
the
servant
took
ten
camels
of
the
camels
of
his
master,
and
departed;
for
all
the
goods
of
his
master
were
in
his
hand:
and
he
arose,
and
went
to
Mesopotamia,
unto
the
city
of
Nahor.
024:011
And
he
made
his
camels
to
kneel
down
without
the
city
by
a
well
of
water
at
the
time
of
the
evening,
even
the
time
that
women
go
out
to
draw
water.
024:012
And
he
said
O
LORD
God
of
my
master
Abraham,
I
pray
thee,
send
me
good
speed
this
day,
and
shew
kindness
unto
my
master
Abraham.
024:013
Behold,
I
stand
here
by
the
well
of
water;
and
the
daughters
of
the
men
of
the
city
come
out
to
draw
water:
024:014
And
let
it
come
to
pass,
that
the
damsel
to
whom
I
shall
say,
Let
down
thy
pitcher,
I
pray
thee,
that
I
may
drink;
and
she
shall
say,
Drink,
and
I
will
give
thy
camels
drink
also:
let
the
same
be
she
that
thou
hast
appointed
for
thy
servant
Isaac;
and
thereby
shall
I
know
that
thou
hast
shewed
kindness
unto
my
master.
024:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
before
he
had
done
speaking,
that,
behold,
Rebekah
came
out,
who
was
born
to
Bethuel,
son
of
Milcah,
the
wife
of
Nahor,
Abraham's
brother,
with
her
pitcher
upon
her
shoulder.
024:016
And
the
damsel
was
very
fair
to
look
upon,
a
virgin,
neither
had
any
man
known
her:
and
she
went
down
to
the
well,
and
filled
her
pitcher,
and
came
up.
024:017
And
the
servant
ran
to
meet
her,
and
said,
Let
me,
I
pray
thee,
drink
a
little
water
of
thy
pitcher.
024:018
And
she
said,
Drink,
my
lord:
and
she
hasted,
and
let
down
her
pitcher
upon
her
hand,
and
gave
him
drink.
024:019
And
when
she
had
done
giving
him
drink,
she
said,
I
will
draw
water
for
thy
camels
also,
until
they
have
done
drinking.
024:020
And
she
hasted,
and
emptied
her
pitcher
into
the
trough,
and
ran
again
unto
the
well
to
draw
water,
and
drew
for
all
his
camels.
024:021
And
the
man
wondering
at
her
held
his
peace,
to
wit
whether
the
LORD
had
made
his
journey
prosperous
or
not.
024:022
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
the
camels
had
done
drinking,
that
the
man
took
a
golden
earring
of
half
a
shekel
weight,
and
two
bracelets
for
her
hands
of
ten
shekels
weight
of
gold;
024:023
And
said,
Whose
daughter
art
thou?
tell
me,
I
pray
thee:
is
there
room
in
thy
father's
house
for
us
to
lodge
in?
024:024
And
she
said
unto
him,
I
am
the
daughter
of
Bethuel
the
son
of
Milcah,
which
she
bare
unto
Nahor.
024:025
She
said
moreover
unto
him,
We
have
both
straw
and
provender
enough,
and
room
to
lodge
in.
024:026
And
the
man
bowed
down
his
head,
and
worshipped
the
LORD.
024:027
And
he
said,
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
my
master
Abraham,
who
hath
not
left
destitute
my
master
of
his
mercy
and
his
truth:
I
being
in
the
way,
the
LORD
led
me
to
the
house
of
my
master's
brethren.
024:028
And
the
damsel
ran,
and
told
them
of
her
mother's
house
these
things.
024:029
And
Rebekah
had
a
brother,
and
his
name
was
Laban:
and
Laban
ran
out
unto
the
man,
unto
the
well.
024:030
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
saw
the
earring
and
bracelets
upon
his
sister's
hands,
and
when
he
heard
the
words
of
Rebekah
his
sister,
saying,
Thus
spake
the
man
unto
me;
that
he
came
unto
the
man;
and,
behold,
he
stood
by
the
camels
at
the
well.
024:031
And
he
said,
Come
in,
thou
blessed
of
the
LORD;
wherefore
standest
thou
without?
for
I
have
prepared
the
house,
and
room
for
the
camels.
024:032
And
the
man
came
into
the
house:
and
he
ungirded
his
camels,
and
gave
straw
and
provender
for
the
camels,
and
water
to
wash
his
feet,
and
the
men's
feet
that
were
with
him.
024:033
And
there
was
set
meat
before
him
to
eat:
but
he
said,
I
will
not
eat,
until
I
have
told
mine
errand.
And
he
said,
Speak
on.
024:034
And
he
said,
I
am
Abraham's
servant.
024:035
And
the
LORD
hath
blessed
my
master
greatly;
and
he
is
become
great:
and
he
hath
given
him
flocks,
and
herds,
and
silver,
and
gold,
and
menservants,
and
maidservants,
and
camels,
and
asses.
024:036
And
Sarah
my
master's
wife
bare
a
son
to
my
master
when
she
was
old:
and
unto
him
hath
he
given
all
that
he
hath.
024:037
And
my
master
made
me
swear,
saying,
Thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
to
my
son
of
the
daughters
of
the
Canaanites,
in
whose
land
I
dwell:
024:038
But
thou
shalt
go
unto
my
father's
house,
and
to
my
kindred,
and
take
a
wife
unto
my
son.
024:039
And
I
said
unto
my
master,
Peradventure
the
woman
will
not
follow
me.
024:040
And
he
said
unto
me,
The
LORD,
before
whom
I
walk,
will
send
his
angel
with
thee,
and
prosper
thy
way;
and
thou
shalt
take
a
wife
for
my
son
of
my
kindred,
and
of
my
father's
house:
024:041
Then
shalt
thou
be
clear
from
this
my
oath,
when
thou
comest
to
my
kindred;
and
if
they
give
not
thee
one,
thou
shalt
be
clear
from
my
oath.
024:042
And
I
came
this
day
unto
the
well,
and
said,
O
LORD
God
of
my
master
Abraham,
if
now
thou
do
prosper
my
way
which
I
go:
024:043
Behold,
I
stand
by
the
well
of
water;
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
when
the
virgin
cometh
forth
to
draw
water,
and
I
say
to
her,
Give
me,
I
pray
thee,
a
little
water
of
thy
pitcher
to
drink;
024:044
And
she
say
to
me,
Both
drink
thou,
and
I
will
