the
man
whose
eyes
are
open
hath
said:
024:016
He
hath
said,
which
heard
the
words
of
God,
and
knew
the
knowledge
of
the
most
High,
which
saw
the
vision
of
the
Almighty,
falling
into
a
trance,
but
having
his
eyes
open:
024:017
I
shall
see
him,
but
not
now:
I
shall
behold
him,
but
not
nigh:
there
shall
come
a
Star
out
of
Jacob,
and
a
Sceptre
shall
rise
out
of
Israel,
and
shall
smite
the
corners
of
Moab,
and
destroy
all
the
children
of
Sheth.
024:018
And
Edom
shall
be
a
possession,
Seir
also
shall
be
a
possession
for
his
enemies;
and
Israel
shall
do
valiantly.
024:019
Out
of
Jacob
shall
come
he
that
shall
have
dominion,
and
shall
destroy
him
that
remaineth
of
the
city.
024:020
And
when
he
looked
on
Amalek,
he
took
up
his
parable,
and
said,
Amalek
was
the
first
of
the
nations;
but
his
latter
end
shall
be
that
he
perish
for
ever.
024:021
And
he
looked
on
the
Kenites,
and
took
up
his
parable,
and
said,
Strong
is
thy
dwellingplace,
and
thou
puttest
thy
nest
in
a
rock.
024:022
Nevertheless
the
Kenite
shall
be
wasted,
until
Asshur
shall
carry
thee
away
captive.
024:023
And
he
took
up
his
parable,
and
said,
Alas,
who
shall
live
when
God
doeth
this!
024:024
And
ships
shall
come
from
the
coast
of
Chittim,
and
shall
afflict
Asshur,
and
shall
afflict
Eber,
and
he
also
shall
perish
for
ever.
024:025
And
Balaam
rose
up,
and
went
and
returned
to
his
place:
and
Balak
also
went
his
way.
025:001
And
Israel
abode
in
Shittim,
and
the
people
began
to
commit
whoredom
with
the
daughters
of
Moab.
025:002
And
they
called
the
people
unto
the
sacrifices
of
their
gods:
and
the
people
did
eat,
and
bowed
down
to
their
gods.
025:003
And
Israel
joined
himself
unto
Baalpeor:
and
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Israel.
025:004
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Take
all
the
heads
of
the
people,
and
hang
them
up
before
the
LORD
against
the
sun,
that
the
fierce
anger
of
the
LORD
may
be
turned
away
from
Israel.
025:005
And
Moses
said
unto
the
judges
of
Israel,
Slay
ye
every
one
his
men
that
were
joined
unto
Baalpeor.
025:006
And,
behold,
one
of
the
children
of
Israel
came
and
brought
unto
his
brethren
a
Midianitish
woman
in
the
sight
of
Moses,
and
in
the
sight
of
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
who
were
weeping
before
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
025:007
And
when
Phinehas,
the
son
of
Eleazar,
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest,
saw
it,
he
rose
up
from
among
the
congregation,
and
took
a
javelin
in
his
hand;
025:008
And
he
went
after
the
man
of
Israel
into
the
tent,
and
thrust
both
of
them
through,
the
man
of
Israel,
and
the
woman
through
her
belly.
So
the
plague
was
stayed
from
the
children
of
Israel.
025:009
And
those
that
died
in
the
plague
were
twenty
and
four
thousand.
025:010
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
025:011
Phinehas,
the
son
of
Eleazar,
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest,
hath
turned
my
wrath
away
from
the
children
of
Israel,
while
he
was
zealous
for
my
sake
among
them,
that
I
consumed
not
the
children
of
Israel
in
my
jealousy.
025:012
Wherefore
say,
Behold,
I
give
unto
him
my
covenant
of
peace:
025:013
And
he
shall
have
it,
and
his
seed
after
him,
even
the
covenant
of
an
everlasting
priesthood;
because
he
was
zealous
for
his
God,
and
made
an
atonement
for
the
children
of
Israel.
025:014
Now
the
name
of
the
Israelite
that
was
slain,
even
that
was
slain
with
the
Midianitish
woman,
was
Zimri,
the
son
of
Salu,
a
prince
of
a
chief
house
among
the
Simeonites.
025:015
And
the
name
of
the
Midianitish
woman
that
was
slain
was
Cozbi,
the
daughter
of
Zur;
he
was
head
over
a
people,
and
of
a
chief
house
in
Midian.
025:016
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
025:017
Vex
the
Midianites,
and
smite
them:
025:018
For
they
vex
you
with
their
wiles,
wherewith
they
have
beguiled
you
in
the
matter
of
Peor,
and
in
the
matter
of
Cozbi,
the
daughter
of
a
prince
of
Midian,
their
sister,
which
was
slain
in
the
day
of
the
plague
for
Peor's
sake.
026:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
the
plague,
that
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest,
saying,
026:002
Take
the
sum
of

years
old

upward,
throughout

fathers'
house,
all
that
are
able
to
go
to
war
in

026:003
And
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
spake
with
them
in
the
plains
of
Moab
by
Jordan
near
Jericho,
saying,
026:004
Take
the
sum
of
the

from
twenty
years
old
and
upward;

commanded

opened
her
mouth,

swallowed
them
up
together
with

died,

the
fire

and
Hoglah,
and
Milcah,
and
Tirzah.
027:002
And
they
stood
before
Moses,
and
before
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
before
the
princes
and
all
the
congregation,
by
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
saying,
027:003
Our
father
died
in
the
wilderness,
and
he
was
not
in
the
company
of
them
that
gathered
themselves
together
against
the
LORD
in
the
company
of
Korah;
but
died
in
his
own
sin,
and
had
no
sons.
027:004
Why
should
the
name
of
our
father
be
done
away
from
among
his
family,
because
he
hath
no
son?
Give
unto
us
therefore
a
possession
among
the
brethren
of
our
father.
027:005
And
Moses
brought
their
cause
before
the
LORD.
027:006
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
027:007
The
daughters
of
Zelophehad
speak
right:
thou
shalt
surely
give
them
a
possession
of
an
inheritance
among
their
father's
brethren;
and
thou
shalt
cause
the
inheritance
of
their
father
to
pass
unto
them.
027:008
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
If
a
man
die,
and
have
no
son,
then
ye
shall
cause
his
inheritance
to
pass
unto
his
daughter.
027:009
And
if
he
have
no
daughter,
then
ye
shall
give
his
inheritance
unto
his
brethren.
027:010
And
if
he
have
no
brethren,
then
ye
shall
give
his
inheritance
unto
his
father's
brethren.
027:011
And
if
his
father
have
no
brethren,
then
ye
shall
give
his
inheritance
unto
his
kinsman
that
is
next
to
him
of
his
family,
and
he
shall
possess
it:
and
it
shall
be
unto
the
children
of
Israel
a
statute
of
judgment,
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
027:012
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Get
thee
up
into
this
mount
Abarim,
and
see
the
land
which
I
have
given
unto
the
children
of
Israel.
027:013
And
when
thou
hast
seen
it,
thou
also
shalt
be
gathered
unto
thy
people,
as
Aaron
thy
brother
was
gathered.
027:014
For
ye
rebelled
against
my
commandment
in
the
desert
of
Zin,
in
the
strife
of
the
congregation,
to
sanctify
me
at
the
water
before
their
eyes:
that
is
the
water
of
Meribah
in
Kadesh
in
the
wilderness
of
Zin.
027:015
And
Moses
spake
unto
the
LORD,
saying,
027:016
Let
the
LORD,
the
God
of
the
spirits
of
all
flesh,
set
a
man
over
the
congregation,
027:017
Which
may
go
out
before
them,
and
which
may
go
in
before
them,
and
which
may
lead
them
out,
and
which
may
bring
them
in;
that
the
congregation
of
the
LORD
be
not
as
sheep
which
have
no
shepherd.
027:018
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Take
thee
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
a
man
in
whom
is
the
spirit,
and
lay
thine
hand
upon
him;
027:019
And
set
him
before
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
before
all
the
congregation;
and
give
him
a
charge
in
their
sight.
027:020
And
thou
shalt
put
some
of
thine
honour
upon
him,
that
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
may
be
obedient.
027:021
And
he
shall
stand
before
Eleazar
the
priest,
who
shall
ask
counsel
for
him
after
the
judgment
of
Urim
before
the
LORD:
at
his
word
shall
they
go
out,
and
at
his
word
they
shall
come
in,
both
he,
and
all
the
children
of
Israel
with
him,
even
all
the
congregation.
027:022
And
Moses
did
as
the
LORD
commanded
him:
and
he
took
Joshua,
and
set
him
before
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
before
all
the
congregation:
027:023
And
he
laid
his
hands
upon
him,
and
gave
him
a
charge,
as
the
LORD
commanded
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
028:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
028:002
Command
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
My
offering,
and
my
bread
for
my
sacrifices
made
by
fire,
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
me,
shall
ye
observe
to
offer
unto
me
in
their
due
season.
028:003
And
thou
shalt
say
unto
them,
This
is
the
offering
made
by
fire
which
ye
shall
offer
unto
the
LORD;
two
lambs
of
the
first
year
without
spot
day
by
day,
for
a
continual
burnt
offering.
028:004
The
one
lamb
shalt
thou
offer
in
the
morning,
and
the
other
lamb
shalt
thou
offer
at
even;
028:005
And
a
tenth
part
of
an
ephah
of
flour
for
a
meat
offering,
mingled
with
the
fourth
part
of
an
hin
of
beaten
oil.
028:006
It
is
a
continual
burnt
offering,
which
was
ordained
in
mount
Sinai
for
a
sweet
savour,
a
sacrifice
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
028:007
And
the
drink
offering
thereof
shall
be
the
fourth
part
of
an
hin
for
the
one
lamb:
in
the
holy
place
shalt
thou
cause
the
strong
wine
to
be
poured
unto
the
LORD
for
a
drink
offering.
028:008
And
the
other
lamb
shalt
thou
offer
at
even:
as
the
meat
offering
of
the
morning,
and
as
the
drink
offering
thereof,
thou
shalt
offer
it,
a
sacrifice
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD.
028:009
And
on
the
sabbath
day
two
lambs
of
the
first
year
without
spot,
and
two
tenth
deals
of
flour
for
a
meat
offering,
mingled
with
oil,
and
the
drink
offering
thereof:
028:010
This
is
the
burnt
offering
of
every
sabbath,
beside
the
continual
burnt
offering,
and
his
drink
offering.
028:011
And
in
the
beginnings
of
your
months
ye
shall
offer
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
LORD;
two
young
bullocks,
and
one
ram,
seven
lambs
of
the
first
year
without
spot;
028:012
And
three
tenth
deals
of
flour
for
a
meat
offering,
mingled
with
oil,
for
one
bullock;
and
two

028:013
And
a
several
tenth

of

mingled
with

for
a

offering
unto
one
lamb;
for
a
burnt

of
a
sweet
savour,
a
sacrifice
made
by
fire
unto
the
LORD.
028:014
And
their
drink
offerings
shall
be
half
an
hin
of
wine
unto
a
bullock,
and
the
third
part
of
an
hin
unto
a
ram,
and
a
fourth
part
of
an
hin
unto
a
lamb:
this
is
the
burnt
offering
of
every
month
throughout
the
months
of
the
year.
028:015
And
one
kid
of
the
goats
for
a

offering
unto
the
LORD
shall
be
offered,
beside
the
continual
burnt
offering,
and
his

offering.
028:016
And
in
the
fourteenth

of
the

is
the

of
the
LORD.
028:017
And
in
the

of

is

be
eaten.
028:018
In

ye

therein:
028:019
But

for

two

and
seven

of

they
shall
be

you
without

028:020
And
their

mingled
with
oil:
three

028:021
A

028:023
Ye

which

028:024
After

throughout

it

028:025
And
on

028:026
Also
