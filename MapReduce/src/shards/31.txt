029:017
And

029:020
And

029:023
And
on

ten

of
the

029:024

029:026
And
on
the
fifth
day
nine

of
the

029:027
And

And

beside
the
continual

and

and
his

029:029
And
on
the
sixth
day
eight
bullocks,
two

and
fourteen
lambs
of
the
first
year
without
blemish:
029:030
And

And

And

029:035
On
the
eighth
day
ye
shall
have
a
solemn
assembly:
ye
shall
do
no
servile
work
therein:
029:036
But
ye
shall
offer
a
burnt
offering,
a
sacrifice
made
by
fire,
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
LORD:
one
bullock,
one
ram,
seven
lambs
of
the
first
year
without
blemish:
029:037
Their
meat

and

029:039
These
things
ye
shall

unto
the
LORD
in
your
set
feasts,
beside
your
vows,
and
your
freewill
offerings,
for
your
burnt
offerings,
and
for
your
meat
offerings,
and
for
your
drink
offerings,
and
for
your
peace
offerings.
029:040
And
Moses
told
the
children
of
Israel
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
030:001
And
Moses
spake
unto
the
heads
of
the
tribes
concerning
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
hath
commanded.
030:002
If
a
man
vow
a
vow
unto
the
LORD,
or
swear
an
oath
to
bind
his
soul
with
a
bond;
he
shall
not
break
his
word,
he
shall
do
according
to
all
that
proceedeth
out
of
his
mouth.
030:003
If
a
woman
also
vow
a
vow
unto
the
LORD,
and
bind
herself
by
a
bond,
being
in
her
father's
house
in
her
youth;
030:004
And
her
father
hear
her
vow,
and
her
bond
wherewith
she
hath
bound
her
soul,
and
her
father
shall
hold
his
peace
at
her;
then
all
her
vows
shall
stand,
and
every
bond
wherewith
she
hath
bound
her
soul
shall
stand.
030:005
But
if
her
father
disallow
her
in
the
day
that
he
heareth;
not
any
of
her
vows,
or
of
her
bonds
wherewith
she
hath
bound
her
soul,
shall
stand:
and
the
LORD
shall
forgive
her,
because
her
father
disallowed
her.
030:006
And
if
she
had
at
all
an
husband,
when
she
vowed,
or
uttered
ought
out
of
her
lips,
wherewith
she
bound
her
soul;
030:007
And
her
husband
heard
it,
and
held
his
peace
at
her
in
the
day
that
he
heard
it:
then
her
vows
shall
stand,
and
her
bonds
wherewith
she
bound
her
soul
shall
stand.
030:008
But
if
her
husband
disallowed
her
on
the
day
that
he
heard
it;
then
he
shall
make
her
vow
which
she
vowed,
and
that
which
she
uttered
with
her
lips,
wherewith
she
bound
her
soul,
of
none
effect:
and
the
LORD
shall
forgive
her.
030:009
But
every
vow
of
a
widow,
and
of
her
that
is
divorced,
wherewith
they
have
bound
their
souls,
shall
stand
against
her.
030:010
And
if
she
vowed
in
her
husband's
house,
or
bound
her
soul
by
a
bond
with
an
oath;
030:011
And
her
husband
heard
it,
and
held
his
peace
at
her,
and
disallowed
her
not:
then
all
her
vows
shall
stand,
and
every
bond
wherewith
she
bound
her
soul
shall
stand.
030:012
But
if
her
husband
hath
utterly
made
them
void
on
the
day
he
heard
them;
then
whatsoever
proceeded
out
of
her
lips
concerning
her
vows,
or
concerning
the
bond
of
her
soul,
shall
not
stand:
her
husband
hath
made
them
void;
and
the
LORD
shall
forgive
her.
030:013
Every
vow,
and
every
binding
oath
to
afflict
the
soul,
her
husband
may
establish
it,
or
her
husband
may
make
it
void.
030:014
But
if
her
husband
altogether
hold
his
peace
at
her
from
day
to
day;
then
he
establisheth
all
her
vows,
or
all
her
bonds,
which
are
upon
her:
he
confirmeth
them,
because
he
held
his
peace
at
her
in
the
day
that
he
heard
them.
030:015
But
if
he
shall
any
ways
make
them
void
after
that
he
hath
heard
them;
then
he
shall
bear
her
iniquity.
030:016
These
are
the
statutes,
which
the
LORD
commanded
Moses,
between
a
man
and
his
wife,
between
the
father
and
his
daughter,
being
yet
in
her
youth
in
her
father's
house.
031:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
031:002
Avenge
the
children
of
Israel
of
the
Midianites:
afterward
shalt
thou
be
gathered
unto
thy
people.
031:003
And
Moses
spake
unto
the
people,
saying,
Arm
some
of
yourselves
unto
the
war,
and
let
them
go
against
the
Midianites,
and
avenge
the
LORD
of
Midian.
031:004
Of
every
tribe
a
thousand,
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
shall
ye
send
to
the
war.
031:005
So
there
were
delivered
out
of
the
thousands
of
Israel,
a
thousand
of
every
tribe,
twelve
thousand
armed
for
war.
031:006
And
Moses
sent
them
to
the
war,
a
thousand
of
every
tribe,
them
and
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
priest,
to
the
war,
with
the
holy
instruments,
and
the
trumpets
to
blow
in
his
hand.
031:007
And
they
warred
against
the
Midianites,
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses;
and
they
slew
all
the
males.
031:008
And
they
slew
the
kings
of
Midian,
beside
the
rest
of
them
that
were
slain;
namely,
Evi,
and
Rekem,
and
Zur,
and
Hur,
and
Reba,
five
kings
of
Midian:
Balaam
also
the
son
of
Beor
they
slew
with
the
sword.
031:009
And
the
children
of
Israel
took
all
the
women
of
Midian
captives,
and
their
little
ones,
and
took
the
spoil
of
all
their
cattle,
and
all
their
flocks,
and
all
their
goods.
031:010
And
they
burnt
all
their
cities
wherein
they
dwelt,
and
all
their
goodly
castles,
with
fire.
031:011
And
they
took
all
the
spoil,
and
all
the
prey,
both
of
men
and
of
beasts.
031:012
And
they
brought
the
captives,
and
the
prey,
and
the
spoil,
unto
Moses,
and
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
unto
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel,
unto
the
camp
at
the
plains
of
Moab,
which
are
by
Jordan
near
Jericho.
031:013
And
Moses,
and
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
all
the
princes
of
the
congregation,
went
forth
to
meet
them
without
the
camp.
031:014
And
Moses
was
wroth
with
the
officers
of
the
host,
with
the
captains
over
thousands,
and
captains
over
hundreds,
which
came
from
the
battle.
031:015
And
Moses
said
unto
them,
Have
ye
saved
all
the
women
alive?
031:016
Behold,
these
caused
the
children
of
Israel,
through
the
counsel
of
Balaam,
to
commit
trespass
against
the
LORD
in
the
matter
of
Peor,
and
there
was
a
plague
among
the
congregation
of
the
LORD.
031:017
Now
therefore
kill
every
male
among
the
little
ones,
and
kill
every
woman
that
hath
known
man
by
lying
with
him.
031:018
But
all
the
women
children,
that
have
not
known
a
man
by
lying
with
him,
keep
alive
for
yourselves.
031:019
And
do
ye
abide
without
the
camp
seven
days:
whosoever
hath
killed
any
person,
and
whosoever
hath
touched
any
slain,
purify
both
yourselves
and
your
captives
on
the
third
day,
and
on
the
seventh
day.
031:020
And
purify
all
your
raiment,
and
all
that
is
made
of
skins,
and
all
work
of
goats'
hair,
and
all
things
made
of
wood.
031:021
And
Eleazar
the
priest
said
unto
the
men
of
war
which
went
to
the
battle,
This
is
the
ordinance
of
the
law
which
the
LORD
commanded
Moses;
031:022
Only
the
gold,
and
the
silver,
the
brass,
the
iron,
the
tin,
and
the
lead,
031:023
Every
thing
that
may
abide
the
fire,
ye
shall
make
it
go
through
the
fire,
and
it
shall
be
clean:
nevertheless
it
shall
be
purified
with
the
water
of
separation:
and
all
that
abideth
not
the
fire
ye
shall
make
go
through
the
water.
031:024
And
ye
shall
wash
your
clothes
on
the
seventh
day,
and
ye
shall
be
clean,
and
afterward
ye
shall
come
into
the
camp.
031:025
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
031:026
Take
the
sum
of
the
prey
that
was
taken,
both
of
man
and
of
beast,
thou,
and
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
the
chief
fathers
of
the
congregation:
031:027
And
divide
the
prey
into
two
parts;
between
them
that
took
the
war
upon
them,
who
went
out
to
battle,
and
between
all
the
congregation:
031:028
And
levy
a
tribute
unto
the
LORD
of
the
men
of
war
which
went
out
to
battle:
one
soul
of
five
hundred,
both
of
the
persons,
and
of
the
beeves,
and
of
the
asses,
and
of
the
sheep:
031:029
Take
it
of
their
half,
and
give
it
unto
Eleazar
the
priest,
for
an
heave
offering
of
the
LORD.
031:030
And
of
the
children
of
Israel's
half,
thou
shalt
take
one
portion
of
fifty,
of
the
persons,
of
the
beeves,
of
the
asses,
and
of
the
flocks,
of
all
manner
of
beasts,
and
give
them
unto
the
Levites,
which
keep
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD.
031:031
And
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
did
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
031:032
And
the
booty,
being
the
rest
of
the
prey
which
the
men
of
war
had
caught,
was
six
hundred
thousand
and
seventy
thousand
and
five
thousand
sheep,
031:033
And
threescore
and
twelve
thousand
beeves,
031:034
And
threescore
and
one
thousand
asses,
031:035
And
thirty
and
two
thousand
persons
in
all,
of
women
that
had
not
known
man
by
lying
with
him.
031:036
And
the
half,
which
was
the
portion
of
them
that
went
out
to
war,
was
in
number
three
hundred
thousand
and
seven
and
thirty
thousand
and
five
hundred
sheep:
031:037
And
the
LORD's
tribute
of
the
sheep
was
six
hundred
and
threescore
and
fifteen.
031:038
And
the
beeves
were
thirty
and
six
thousand;
of
which
the
LORD's
tribute
was
threescore
and
twelve.
031:039
And
the
asses
were
thirty
thousand
and
five
hundred;
of
which
the
LORD's
tribute
was
threescore
and
one.
031:040
And
the
persons
were
sixteen
thousand;
of
which
the
LORD's
tribute
was
thirty
and
two
persons.
031:041
And
Moses
gave
the
tribute,
which
was
the
LORD's
heave
offering,
unto
Eleazar
the
priest,
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
031:042
And
of
the
children
of
Israel's
half,
which
Moses
divided
from
the
men
that
warred,
031:043
(Now
the
half
that
pertained
unto
the
congregation
was
three
hundred
thousand
and
thirty
thousand
and
seven
thousand
and
five
hundred
sheep,
031:044
And
thirty
and
six
thousand
beeves,
031:045
And
thirty
thousand
asses
and
five
hundred,
031:046
And
sixteen
thousand
persons;)
031:047
Even
of
the
children
of
Israel's
half,
Moses
took
one
portion
of
fifty,
both
of
man
and
of
beast,
and
gave
them
unto
the
Levites,
which
kept
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD;
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
031:048
And
the
officers
which
were
over
thousands
of
the
host,
the
captains
of
thousands,
and
captains
of
hundreds,
came
near
unto
Moses:
031:049
And
they
said
unto
Moses,
Thy
servants
have
taken
the
sum
of
the
men
of
war
which
are
under
our
charge,
and
there
lacketh
not
one
man
of
us.
031:050
We
have
therefore
brought
an
oblation
for
the
LORD,
what
every
man
hath
gotten,
of
jewels
of
gold,
chains,
and
bracelets,
rings,
earrings,
and
tablets,
to
make
an
atonement
for
our
souls
before
the
LORD.
031:051
And
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
took
the
gold
of
them,
even
all
wrought
jewels.
031:052
And
all
the
gold
of
the
offering
that
they
offered
up
to
the
LORD,
of
the
captains
of
thousands,
and
of
the
captains
of
hundreds,
was
sixteen
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fifty
shekels.
031:053
(For
the
men
of
war
had
taken
spoil,
every
man
for
himself.)
031:054
And
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
took
the
gold
of
the
captains
of
thousands
and
of
hundreds,
and
brought
it
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
for
a
memorial
for
the
children
of
Israel
before
the
LORD.
032:001
Now
the
children
of
Reuben
and
the
children
of
Gad
had
a
very
great
multitude
of
cattle:
and
when
they
saw
the
land
of
Jazer,
and
the
land
of
Gilead,
that,
behold,
the
place
was
a
place
for
cattle;
032:002
The
children
of
Gad
and
the
children
of
Reuben
came
and
spake
unto
Moses,
and
to
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
unto
the
princes
of
the
congregation,
saying,
032:003
Ataroth,
and
Dibon,
and
Jazer,
and
Nimrah,
and
Heshbon,
and
Elealeh,
and
Shebam,
and
Nebo,
and
Beon,
032:004
Even
the
country
which
the
LORD
smote
before
the
congregation
of
Israel,
is
a
land
for
cattle,
and
thy
servants
have
cattle:
032:005
Wherefore,
said
they,
if
we
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight,
let
this
land
be
given
unto
thy
servants
for
a
possession,
and
bring
us
not
over
Jordan.
032:006
And
Moses
said
unto
the
children
of
Gad
and
to
the
children
of
Reuben,
Shall
your
brethren
go
to
war,
and
shall
ye
sit
here?
032:007
And
wherefore
discourage
ye
the
heart
of
the
children
of
Israel
from
going
over
into
the
land
which
the
LORD
hath
given
them?
032:008
Thus
did
your
fathers,
when
I
sent
them
from
Kadeshbarnea
to
see
the
land.
032:009
For
when
they
went
up
unto
the
valley
of
Eshcol,
and
saw
the
land,
they
discouraged
the
heart
of
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
should
not
go
into
the
land
which
the
LORD
had
given
them.
032:010
And
the
LORD's
anger
was
kindled
the
same
time,
and
he
sware,
saying,
032:011
Surely
none
of
the
men
that
came
up
out
of
Egypt,
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward,
shall
see
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
Abraham,
unto
Isaac,
and
unto
Jacob;
because
they
have
not
wholly
followed
me:
032:012
Save
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
the
Kenezite,
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun:
for
they
have
wholly
followed
the
LORD.
032:013
And
the
LORD's
anger
was
kindled
against
Israel,
and
he
made
them
wander
in
the
wilderness
forty
years,
until
all
the
generation,
that
had
done
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
was
consumed.
032:014
And,
behold,
ye
are
risen
up
in
your
fathers'
stead,
an
increase
of
sinful
men,
to
augment
yet
the
fierce
anger
of
the
LORD
toward
Israel.
032:015
For
if
ye
turn
away
from
after
him,
he
will
yet
again
leave
them
in
the
wilderness;
and
ye
shall
destroy
all
this
people.
032:016
And
they
came
near
unto
him,
and
said,
We
will
build
sheepfolds
here
for
our
cattle,
and
cities
for
our
little
ones:
032:017
But
we
ourselves
will
go
ready
armed
before
the
children
of
Israel,
until
we
have
brought
them
unto
their
place:
and
our
little
ones
shall
dwell
in
the
fenced
cities
because
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
land.
032:018
We
will
not
return
unto
our
houses,
until
the
children
of
Israel
have
inherited
every
man
his
inheritance.
032:019
For
we
will
not
inherit
with
them
on
yonder
side
Jordan,
or
forward;
because
our
inheritance
is
fallen
to
us
on
this
side
Jordan
eastward.
032:020
And
Moses
said
unto
them,
If
ye
will
do
this
thing,
if
ye
will
go
armed
before
the
LORD
to
war,
032:021
And
will
go
all
of
you
armed
over
Jordan
before
the
LORD,
until
he
hath
driven
out
his
enemies
from
before
him,
032:022
And
the
land
be
subdued
before
the
LORD:
then
afterward
ye
shall
return,
and
be
guiltless
before
the
LORD,
and
before
Israel;
and
this
land
shall
be
your
possession
before
the
LORD.
032:023
But
if
ye
will
not
do
so,
behold,
ye
have
sinned
against
the
LORD:
and
be
sure
your
sin
will
find
you
out.
032:024
Build
you
cities
for
your
little
ones,
and
folds
for
your
sheep;
and
do
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
your
mouth.
032:025
And
the
children
of
Gad
and
the
children
of
Reuben
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
Thy
servants
will
do
as
my
lord
commandeth.
032:026
Our
little
ones,
our
wives,
our
flocks,
and
all
our
cattle,
shall
be
there
in
the
cities
of
Gilead:
032:027
But
thy
servants
will
pass
over,
every
man
armed
for
war,
before
the
Lord
to
battle,
as
my
lord
saith.
032:028
So
concerning
them
Moses
commanded
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
and
the
chief
fathers
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
Israel:
032:029
And
Moses
said
unto
them,
If
the
children
of
Gad
and
the
children
of
Reuben
will
pass
with
you
over
Jordan,
every
man
armed
to
battle,
before
the
LORD,
and
the
land
shall
be
subdued
before
you;
then
ye
shall
give
them
the
land
of
Gilead
for
a
possession:
032:030
But
if
they
will
not
pass
over
with
you
armed,
they
shall
have
possessions
among
you
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
032:031
And
the
children
of
Gad
and
the
children
of
Reuben
answered,
saying,
As
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
thy
servants,
so
will
we
do.
032:032
We
will
pass
over
armed
before
the
LORD
into
the
land
of
Canaan,
that
the
possession
of
our
inheritance
on
this
side
Jordan
may
be
our's.
032:033
And
Moses
gave
unto
them,
even
to
the
children
of
Gad,
and
to
the
children
of
Reuben,
and
unto
half
the
tribe
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Joseph,
the
kingdom
of
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
and
the
kingdom
of
Og
king
of
Bashan,
the
land,
with
the
cities
thereof
in
the
coasts,
even
the
cities
of
the
country
round
about.
032:034
And
the
children
of
Gad
built
Dibon,
and
Ataroth,
and
Aroer,
032:035
And
Atroth,
Shophan,
and
Jaazer,
and
Jogbehah,
032:036
And
Bethnimrah,
and
Bethharan,
fenced
cities:
and
folds
for
sheep.
032:037
And
the
children
of
Reuben
built
Heshbon,
and
Elealeh,
and
Kirjathaim,
032:038
And
Nebo,
and
Baalmeon,
(their
names
being
changed,)
and
Shibmah:
and
gave
other
names
unto
the
cities
which
they
builded.
032:039
And
the
children
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
went
to
Gilead,
and
took
it,
and
dispossessed
the
Amorite
which
was
in
it.
032:040
And
Moses
gave
Gilead
unto
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh;
and
he
dwelt
therein.
032:041
And
Jair
the
son
of
Manasseh
went
and
took
the
small
towns
thereof,
and
called
them
Havothjair.
032:042
And
Nobah
went
and
took
Kenath,
and
the
villages
thereof,
and
called
it
Nobah,
after
his
own
name.
033:001
These
are
the
journeys
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
went
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
their
armies
under
the
hand
of
Moses
and
Aaron.
033:002
And
Moses
wrote
their
goings
out
according
to
their
journeys
by
the
commandment
of
the
LORD:
and
these
are
their
journeys
according
to
their
goings
out.
033:003
And
they
departed
from
Rameses
in
the
first
month,
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
first
month;
on
the
morrow
after
the
passover
the
children
of
Israel
went
out
with
an
high
hand
in
the
sight
of
all
the
Egyptians.
033:004
For
the
Egyptians
buried
all
their
firstborn,
which
the
LORD
had
smitten
among
them:
upon
their
gods
also
the
LORD
executed
judgments.
033:005
And
the
children
of
Israel
removed
from
Rameses,
and
pitched
in
Succoth.
033:006
And
they
departed
from
Succoth,
and
pitched
in
Etham,
which
is
in
the
edge
of
the
wilderness.
033:007
And
they
removed
from
Etham,
and
turned
again
unto
Pihahiroth,
which
is
before
Baalzephon:
and
they
pitched
before
Migdol.
033:008
And
they
departed
from
before
Pihahiroth,
and
passed
through
the
midst
of
the
sea
into
the
wilderness,
and
went
three
days'
journey
in
the
wilderness
of
Etham,
and
pitched
in
Marah.
033:009
And
they
removed
from
Marah,
and
came
unto
Elim:
and
in
Elim
were
twelve
fountains
of
water,
and
threescore
and
ten
palm
trees;
and
they
pitched
there.
033:010
And
they
removed
from
Elim,
and
encamped
by
the
Red
sea.
033:011
And
they
removed
from
the
Red
sea,
and
encamped
in
the
wilderness
of
Sin.
033:012
And
they
took
their
journey
out
of
the
wilderness
of
Sin,
and
encamped
in
Dophkah.
033:013
And
they
departed
from
Dophkah,
and
encamped
in
Alush.
033:014
And
they
removed
from
Alush,
and
encamped
at
Rephidim,
where
was
no
water
for
the
people
to
drink.
033:015
And
they
departed
from
Rephidim,
and
pitched
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai.
033:016
And
they
removed
from
the
desert
of
Sinai,
and
pitched
at
Kibrothhattaavah.
033:017
And
they
departed
from
Kibrothhattaavah,
and
encamped
at
Hazeroth.
033:018
And
they
departed
from
Hazeroth,
and
pitched
in
Rithmah.
033:019
And
they
departed
from
Rithmah,
and
pitched
at
Rimmonparez.
033:020
And
they
departed
from
Rimmonparez,
and
pitched
in
Libnah.
033:021
And
they
removed
from
Libnah,
and
pitched
at
Rissah.
033:022
And
they
journeyed
from
Rissah,
and
pitched
in
Kehelathah.
033:023
And
they
went
from
Kehelathah,
and
pitched
in
mount
Shapher.
033:024
And
they
removed
from
mount
Shapher,
and
encamped
in
Haradah.
033:025
And
they
removed
from
Haradah,
and
pitched
in
Makheloth.
033:026
And
they
removed
from
Makheloth,
and
encamped
at
Tahath.
033:027
And
they
departed
from
Tahath,
and
pitched
at
Tarah.
033:028
And
they
removed
from
Tarah,
and
pitched
in
Mithcah.
033:029
And
they
went
from
Mithcah,
and
pitched
in
Hashmonah.
033:030
And
they
departed
from
Hashmonah,
and
encamped
at
Moseroth.
033:031
And
they
departed
from
Moseroth,
and
pitched
in
Benejaakan.
033:032
And
they
removed
from
Benejaakan,
and
encamped
at
Horhagidgad.
033:033
And
they
went
from
Horhagidgad,
and
pitched
in
Jotbathah.
033:034
And
they
removed
from
Jotbathah,
and
encamped
at
Ebronah.
033:035
And
they
departed
from
Ebronah,
and
encamped
at
Eziongaber.
033:036
And
they
removed
from
Eziongaber,
and
pitched
in
the
wilderness
of
Zin,
which
is
Kadesh.
033:037
And
they
removed
from
Kadesh,
and
pitched
in
mount
Hor,
in
the
edge
of
the
land
of
Edom.
033:038
And
Aaron
the
priest
went
up
into
mount
Hor
at
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
and
died
there,
in
the
fortieth
year
after
the
children
of
Israel
were
come
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
in
the
first
day
of
the
fifth
month.
033:039
And
Aaron
was
an
hundred
and
twenty
and
three
years
old
when
he
died
in
mount
Hor.
033:040
And
king
Arad
the
Canaanite,
which
dwelt
in
the
south
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
heard
of
the
coming
of
the
children
of
Israel.
033:041
And
they
departed
from
mount
Hor,
and
pitched
in
Zalmonah.
033:042
And
they
departed
from
Zalmonah,
and
pitched
in
Punon.
033:043
And
they
departed
from
Punon,
and
pitched
in
Oboth.
033:044
And
they
departed
from
Oboth,
and
pitched
in
Ijeabarim,
in
the
border
of
Moab.
