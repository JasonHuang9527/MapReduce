033:045
And
they
departed
from
Iim,
and
pitched
in
Dibongad.
033:046
And
they
removed
from
Dibongad,
and
encamped
in
Almondiblathaim.
033:047
And
they
removed
from
Almondiblathaim,
and
pitched
in
the
mountains
of
Abarim,
before
Nebo.
033:048
And
they
departed
from
the
mountains
of
Abarim,
and
pitched
in
the
plains
of
Moab
by
Jordan
near
Jericho.
033:049
And
they
pitched
by
Jordan,
from
Bethjesimoth
even
unto
Abelshittim
in
the
plains
of
Moab.
033:050
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
in
the
plains
of
Moab
by
Jordan
near
Jericho,
saying,
033:051
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
ye
are
passed
over
Jordan
into
the
land
of
Canaan;
033:052
Then
ye
shall
drive
out
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
from
before
you,
and
destroy
all
their
pictures,
and
destroy
all
their
molten
images,
and
quite
pluck
down
all
their
high
places:
033:053
And
ye
shall
dispossess
the
inhabitants
of
the
land,
and
dwell
therein:
for
I
have
given
you
the
land
to
possess
it.
033:054
And
ye
shall
divide
the
land
by
lot
for
an
inheritance
among
your
families:
and
to
the
more
ye
shall
give
the
more
inheritance,
and
to
the
fewer
ye
shall
give
the
less
inheritance:
every
man's
inheritance
shall
be
in
the
place
where
his
lot
falleth;
according
to
the
tribes
of
your
fathers
ye
shall
inherit.
033:055
But
if
ye
will
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
from
before
you;
then
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
those
which
ye
let
remain
of
them
shall
be
pricks
in
your
eyes,
and
thorns
in
your
sides,
and
shall
vex
you
in
the
land
wherein
ye
dwell.
033:056
Moreover
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
I
shall
do
unto
you,
as
I
thought
to
do
unto
them.
034:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
034:002
Command
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
ye
come
into
the
land
of
Canaan;
(this
is
the
land
that
shall
fall
unto
you
for
an
inheritance,
even
the
land
of
Canaan
with
the
coasts
thereof:)
034:003
Then
your
south
quarter
shall
be
from
the
wilderness
of
Zin
along
by
the
coast
of
Edom,
and
your
south
border
shall
be
the
outmost
coast
of
the
salt
sea
eastward:
034:004
And
your
border
shall
turn
from
the
south
to
the
ascent
of
Akrabbim,
and
pass
on
to
Zin:
and
the
going
forth
thereof
shall
be
from
the
south
to
Kadeshbarnea,
and
shall
go
on
to
Hazaraddar,
and
pass
on
to
Azmon:
034:005
And
the
border
shall
fetch
a
compass
from
Azmon
unto
the
river
of
Egypt,
and
the
goings
out
of
it
shall
be
at
the
sea.
034:006
And
as
for
the
western
border,
ye
shall
even
have
the
great
sea
for
a
border:
this
shall
be
your
west
border.
034:007
And
this
shall
be
your
north
border:
from
the
great
sea
ye
shall
point
out
for
you
mount
Hor:
034:008
From
mount
Hor
ye
shall
point
out
your
border
unto
the
entrance
of
Hamath;
and
the
goings
forth
of
the
border
shall
be
to
Zedad:
034:009
And
the
border
shall
go
on
to
Ziphron,
and
the
goings
out
of
it
shall
be
at
Hazarenan:
this
shall
be
your
north
border.
034:010
And
ye
shall
point
out
your
east
border
from
Hazarenan
to
Shepham:
034:011
And
the
coast
shall
go
down
from
Shepham
to
Riblah,
on
the
east
side
of
Ain;
and
the
border
shall
descend,
and
shall
reach
unto
the
side
of
the
sea
of
Chinnereth
eastward:
034:012
And
the
border
shall
go
down
to
Jordan,
and
the
goings
out
of
it
shall
be
at
the
salt
sea:
this
shall
be
your
land
with
the
coasts
thereof
round
about.
034:013
And
Moses
commanded
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
This
is
the
land
which
ye
shall
inherit
by
lot,
which
the
LORD
commanded
to
give
unto
the
nine
tribes,
and
to
the
half
tribe:
034:014
For
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Reuben
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers,
and
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Gad
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers,
have
received
their
inheritance;
and
half
the
tribe
of
Manasseh
have
received
their
inheritance:
034:015
The
two
tribes
and
the
half
tribe
have
received
their
inheritance
on
this
side
Jordan
near
Jericho
eastward,
toward
the
sunrising.
034:016
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
034:017
These
are
the
names
of
the
men
which
shall
divide
the
land
unto
you:
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun.
034:018
And
ye
shall
take
one
prince
of
every
tribe,
to
divide
the
land
by
inheritance.
034:019
And
the
names
of
the
men
are
these:
Of
the
tribe
of
Judah,
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh.
034:020
And
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Simeon,
Shemuel
the
son
of
Ammihud.
034:021
Of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin,
Elidad
the
son
of
Chislon.
034:022
And
the
prince
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Dan,
Bukki
the
son
of
Jogli.
034:023
The
prince
of
the
children
of
Joseph,
for
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Manasseh,
Hanniel
the
son
of
Ephod.
034:024
And
the
prince
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Ephraim,
Kemuel
the
son
of
Shiphtan.
034:025
And
the
prince
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Zebulun,
Elizaphan
the
son
of
Parnach.
034:026
And
the
prince
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Issachar,
Paltiel
the
son
of
Azzan.
034:027
And
the
prince
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Asher,
Ahihud
the
son
of
Shelomi.
034:028
And
the
prince
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Naphtali,
Pedahel
the
son
of
Ammihud.
034:029
These
are
they
whom
the
LORD
commanded
to
divide
the
inheritance
unto
the
children
of
Israel
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
035:001
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
in
the
plains
of
Moab
by
Jordan
near
Jericho,
saying,
035:002
Command
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
give
unto
the
Levites
of
the
inheritance
of
their
possession
cities
to
dwell
in;
and
ye
shall
give
also
unto
the
Levites
suburbs
for
the
cities
round
about
them.
035:003
And
the
cities
shall
they
have
to
dwell
in;
and
the
suburbs
of
them
shall
be
for
their
cattle,
and
for
their
goods,
and
for
all
their
beasts.
035:004
And
the
suburbs
of
the
cities,
which
ye
shall
give
unto
the
Levites,
shall
reach
from
the
wall
of
the
city
and
outward
a
thousand
cubits
round
about.
035:005
And
ye
shall
measure
from
without
the
city
on
the
east
side
two
thousand
cubits,
and
on
the
south
side
two
thousand
cubits,
and
on
the
west
side
two
thousand
cubits,
and
on
the
north
side
two
thousand
cubits;
and
the
city
shall
be
in
the
midst:
this
shall
be
to
them
the
suburbs
of
the
cities.
035:006
And
among
the
cities
which
ye
shall
give
unto
the
Levites
there
shall
be
six
cities
for
refuge,
which
ye
shall
appoint
for
the
manslayer,
that
he
may
flee
thither:
and
to
them
ye
shall
add
forty
and
two
cities.
035:007
So
all
the
cities
which
ye
shall
give
to
the
Levites
shall
be
forty
and
eight
cities:
them
shall
ye
give
with
their
suburbs.
035:008
And
the
cities
which
ye
shall
give
shall
be
of
the
possession
of
the
children
of
Israel:
from
them
that
have
many
ye
shall
give
many;
but
from
them
that
have
few
ye
shall
give
few:
every
one
shall
give
of
his
cities
unto
the
Levites
according
to
his
inheritance
which
he
inheriteth.
035:009
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses,
saying,
035:010
Speak
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
and
say
unto
them,
When
ye
be
come
over
Jordan
into
the
land
of
Canaan;
035:011
Then
ye
shall
appoint
you
cities
to
be
cities
of
refuge
for
you;
that
the
slayer
may
flee
thither,
which
killeth
any
person
at
unawares.
035:012
And
they
shall
be
unto
you
cities
for
refuge
from
the
avenger;
that
the
manslayer
die
not,
until
he
stand
before
the
congregation
in
judgment.
035:013
And
of
these
cities
which
ye
shall
give
six
cities
shall
ye
have
for
refuge.
035:014
Ye
shall
give
three
cities
on
this
side
Jordan,
and
three
cities
shall
ye
give
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
which
shall
be
cities
of
refuge.
035:015
These
six
cities
shall
be
a
refuge,
both
for
the
children
of
Israel,
and
for
the
stranger,
and
for
the
sojourner
among
them:
that
every
one
that
killeth
any
person
unawares
may
flee
thither.
035:016
And
if
he
smite
him
with
an
instrument
of
iron,
so
that
he
die,
he
is
a
murderer:
the
murderer
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
035:017
And
if
he
smite
him
with
throwing
a
stone,
wherewith
he
may
die,
and
he
die,
he
is
a
murderer:
the
murderer
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
035:018
Or
if
he
smite
him
with
an
hand
weapon
of
wood,
wherewith
he
may
die,
and
he
die,
he
is
a
murderer:
the
murderer
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
035:019
The
revenger
of
blood
himself
shall
slay
the
murderer:
when
he
meeteth
him,
he
shall
slay
him.
035:020
But
if
he
thrust
him
of
hatred,
or
hurl
at
him
by
laying
of
wait,
that
he
die;
035:021
Or
in
enmity
smite
him
with
his
hand,
that
he
die:
he
that
smote
him
shall
surely
be
put
to
death;
for
he
is
a
murderer:
the
revenger
of
blood
shall
slay
the
murderer,
when
he
meeteth
him.
035:022
But
if
he
thrust
him
suddenly
without
enmity,
or
have
cast
upon
him
any
thing
without
laying
of
wait,
035:023
Or
with
any
stone,
wherewith
a
man
may
die,
seeing
him
not,
and
cast
it
upon
him,
that
he
die,
and
was
not
his
enemy,
neither
sought
his
harm:
035:024
Then
the
congregation
shall
judge
between
the
slayer
and
the
revenger
of
blood
according
to
these
judgments:
035:025
And
the
congregation
shall
deliver
the
slayer
out
of
the
hand
of
the
revenger
of
blood,
and
the
congregation
shall
restore
him
to
the
city
of
his
refuge,
whither
he
was
fled:
and
he
shall
abide
in
it
unto
the
death
of
the
high
priest,
which
was
anointed
with
the
holy
oil.
035:026
But
if
the
slayer
shall
at
any
time
come
without
the
border
of
the
city
of
his
refuge,
whither
he
was
fled;
035:027
And
the
revenger
of
blood
find
him
without
the
borders
of
the
city
of
his
refuge,
and
the
revenger
of
blood
kill
the
slayer;
he
shall
not
be
guilty
of
blood:
035:028
Because
he
should
have
remained
in
the
city
of
his
refuge
until
the
death
of
the
high
priest:
but
after
the
death
of
the
high
priest
the
slayer
shall
return
into
the
land
of
his
possession.
035:029
So
these
things
shall
be
for
a
statute
of
judgment
unto
you
throughout
your
generations
in
all
your
dwellings.
035:030
Whoso
killeth
any
person,
the
murderer
shall
be
put
to
death
by
the
mouth
of
witnesses:
but
one
witness
shall
not
testify
against
any
person
to
cause
him
to
die.
035:031
Moreover
ye
shall
take
no
satisfaction
for
the
life
of
a
murderer,
which
is
guilty
of
death:
but
he
shall
be
surely
put
to
death.
035:032
And
ye
shall
take
no
satisfaction
for
him
that
is
fled
to
the
city
of
his
refuge,
that
he
should
come
again
to
dwell
in
the
land,
until
the
death
of
the
priest.
035:033
So
ye
shall
not
pollute
the
land
wherein
ye
are:
for
blood
it
defileth
the
land:
and
the
land
cannot
be
cleansed
of
the
blood
that
is
shed
therein,
but
by
the
blood
of
him
that
shed
it.
035:034
Defile
not
therefore
the
land
which
ye
shall
inhabit,
wherein
I
dwell:
for
I
the
LORD
dwell
among
the
children
of
Israel.
036:001
And
the
chief
fathers
of
the
families
of
the
children
of
Gilead,
the
son
of
Machir,
the
son
of
Manasseh,
of
the
families
of
the
sons
of
Joseph,
came
near,
and
spake
before
Moses,
and
before
the
princes,
the
chief
fathers
of
the
children
of
Israel:
036:002
And
they
said,
The
LORD
commanded
my
lord
to
give
the
land
for
an
inheritance
by
lot
to
the
children
of
Israel:
and
my
lord
was
commanded
by
the
LORD
to
give
the
inheritance
of
Zelophehad
our
brother
unto
his
daughters.
036:003
And
if
they
be
married
to
any
of
the
sons
of
the
other
tribes
of
the
children
of
Israel,
then
shall
their
inheritance
be
taken
from
the
inheritance
of
our
fathers,
and
shall
be
put
to
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
whereunto
they
are
received:
so
shall
it
be
taken
from
the
lot
of
our
inheritance.
036:004
And
when
the
jubile
of
the
children
of
Israel
shall
be,
then
shall
their
inheritance
be
put
unto
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
whereunto
they
are
received:
so
shall
their
inheritance
be
taken
away
from
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
our
fathers.
036:005
And
Moses
commanded
the
children
of
Israel
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
saying,
The
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Joseph
hath
said
well.
036:006
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
doth
command
concerning
the
daughters
of
Zelophehad,
saying,
Let
them
marry
to
whom
they
think
best;
only
to
the
family
of
the
tribe
of
their
father
shall
they
marry.
036:007
So
shall
not
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Israel
remove
from
tribe
to
tribe:
for
every
one
of
the
children
of
Israel
shall
keep
himself
to
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
his
fathers.
036:008
And
every
daughter,
that
possesseth
an
inheritance
in
any
tribe
of
the
children
of
Israel,
shall
be
wife
unto
one
of
the
family
of
the
tribe
of
her
father,
that
the
children
of
Israel
may
enjoy
every
man
the
inheritance
of
his
fathers.
036:009
Neither
shall
the
inheritance
remove
from
one
tribe
to
another
tribe;
but
every
one
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
Israel
shall
keep
himself
to
his
own
inheritance.
036:010
Even
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses,
so
did
the
daughters
of
Zelophehad:
036:011
For
Mahlah,
Tirzah,
and
Hoglah,
and
Milcah,
and
Noah,
the
daughters
of
Zelophehad,
were
married
unto
their
father's
brothers'
sons:
036:012
And
they
were
married
into
the
families
of
the
sons
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Joseph,
and
their
inheritance
remained
in
the
tribe
of
the
family
of
their
father.
036:013
These
are
the
commandments
and
the
judgments,
which
the
LORD
commanded
by
the
hand
of
Moses
unto
the
children
of
Israel
in
the
plains
of
Moab
by
Jordan
near
Jericho.
Book
05	Deuteronomy
001:001
These
be
the
words
which
Moses
spake
unto
all
Israel
on
this
side
Jordan
in
the
wilderness,
in
the
plain
over
against
the
Red
sea,
between
Paran,
and
Tophel,
and
Laban,
and
Hazeroth,
and
Dizahab.
001:002
(There
are
eleven
days'
journey
from
Horeb
by
the
way
of
mount
Seir
unto
Kadeshbarnea.)
001:003
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fortieth
year,
in
the
eleventh
month,
on
the
first
day
of
the
month,
that
Moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
according
unto
all
that
the
LORD
had
given
him
in
commandment
unto
them;
001:004
After
he
had
slain
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites,
which
dwelt
in
Heshbon,
and
Og
the
king
of
Bashan,
which
dwelt
at
Astaroth
in
Edrei:
001:005
On
this
side
Jordan,
in
the
land
of
Moab,
began
Moses
to
declare
this
law,
saying,
001:006
The
LORD
our
God
spake
unto
us
in
Horeb,
saying,
Ye
have
dwelt
long
enough
in
this
mount:
001:007
Turn
you,
and
take
your
journey,
and
go
to
the
mount
of
the
Amorites,
and
unto
all
the
places
nigh
thereunto,
in
the
plain,
in
the
hills,
and
in
the
vale,
and
in
the
south,
and
by
the
sea
side,
to
the
land
of
the
Canaanites,
and
unto
Lebanon,
unto
the
great
river,
the
river
Euphrates.
001:008
Behold,
I
have
set
the
land
before
you:
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
your
fathers,
Abraham,
Isaac,
and
Jacob,
to
give
unto
them
and
to
their
seed
after
them.
001:009
And
I
spake
unto
you
at
that
time,
saying,
I
am
not
able
to
bear
you
myself
alone:
001:010
The
LORD
your
God
hath
multiplied
you,
and,
behold,
ye
are
this
day
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
multitude.
001:011
(The
LORD
God
of
your
fathers
make
you
a
thousand
times
so
many
more
as
ye
are,
and
bless
you,
as
he
hath
promised
you!)
001:012
How
can
I
myself
alone
bear
your
cumbrance,
and
your
burden,
and
your
strife?
001:013
Take
you
wise
men,
and
understanding,
and
known
among
your
tribes,
and
I
will
make
them
rulers
over
you.
001:014
And
ye
answered
me,
and
said,
The
thing
which
thou
hast
spoken
is
good
for
us
to
do.
001:015
So
I
took
the
chief
of
your
tribes,
wise
men,
and
known,
and
made
them
heads
over
you,
captains
over
thousands,
and
captains
over
hundreds,
and
captains
over
fifties,
and
captains
over
tens,
and
officers
among
your
tribes.
001:016
And
I
charged
your
judges
at
that
time,
saying,
Hear
the
causes
between
your
brethren,
and
judge
righteously
between
every
man
and
his
brother,
and
the
stranger
that
is
with
him.
001:017
Ye
shall
not
respect
persons
in
judgment;
but
ye
shall
hear
the
small
as
well
as
the
great;
ye
shall
not
be
afraid
of
the
face
of
man;
for
the
judgment
is
God's:
and
the
cause
that
is
too
hard
for
you,
bring
it
unto
me,
and
I
will
hear
it.
001:018
And
I
commanded
you
at
that
time
all
the
things
which
ye
should
do.
001:019
And
when
we
departed
from
Horeb,
we
went
through
all
that
great
and
terrible
wilderness,
which
ye
saw
by
the
way
of
the
mountain
of
the
Amorites,
as
the
LORD
our
God
commanded
us;
and
we
came
to
Kadeshbarnea.
001:020
And
I
said
unto
you,
Ye
are
come
unto
the
mountain
of
the
Amorites,
which
the
LORD
our
God
doth
give
unto
us.
001:021
Behold,
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
set
the
land
before
thee:
go
up
and
possess
it,
as
the
LORD
God
of
thy
fathers
hath
said
unto
thee;
fear
not,
neither
be
discouraged.
001:022
And
ye
came
near
unto
me
every
one
of
you,
and
said,
We
will
send
men
before
us,
and
they
shall
search
us
out
the
land,
and
bring
us
word
again
by
what
way
we
must
go
up,
and
into
what
cities
we
shall
come.
001:023
And
the
saying
pleased
me
well:
and
I
took
twelve
men
of
you,
one
of
a
tribe:
001:024
And
they
turned
and
went
up
into
the
mountain,
and
came
unto
the
valley
of
Eshcol,
and
searched
it
out.
001:025
And
they
took
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
in
their
hands,
and
brought
it
down
unto
us,
and
brought
us
word
again,
and
said,
It
is
a
good
land
which
the
LORD
our
God
doth
give
us.
001:026
Notwithstanding
ye
would
not
go
up,
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
your
God:
001:027
And
ye
murmured
in
your
tents,
and
said,
Because
the
LORD
hated
us,
he
hath
brought
us
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
Amorites,
to
destroy
us.
001:028
Whither
shall
we
go
up?
our
brethren
have
discouraged
our
heart,
saying,
The
people
is
greater
and
taller
than
we;
the
cities
are
great
and
walled
up
to
heaven;
and
moreover
we
have
seen
the
sons
of
the
Anakims
there.
001:029
Then
I
said
unto
you,
Dread
not,
neither
be
afraid
of
them.
001:030
The
LORD
your
God
which
goeth
before
you,
he
shall
fight
for
you,
according
to
all
that
he
did
for
you
in
Egypt
before
your
eyes;
001:031
And
in
the
wilderness,
where
thou
hast
seen
how
that
the
LORD
thy
God
bare
thee,
as
a
man
doth
bear
his
son,
in
all
the
way
that
ye
went,
until
ye
came
into
this
place.
001:032
Yet
in
this
thing
ye
did
not
believe
the
LORD
your
God,
001:033
Who
went
in
the
way
before
you,
to
search
you
out
a
place
to
pitch
your
tents
in,
in
fire
by
night,
to
shew
you
by
what
way
ye
should
go,
and
in
a
cloud
by
day.
001:034
And
the
LORD
heard
the
voice
of
your
words,
and
was
wroth,
and
sware,
saying,
001:035
Surely
there
shall
not
one
of
these
men
of
this
evil
generation
see
that
good
land,
which
I
sware
to
give
unto
your
fathers.
001:036
Save
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh;
he
shall
see
it,
and
to
him
will
I
give
the
land
that
he
hath
trodden
upon,
and
to
his
children,
because
he
hath
wholly
followed
the
LORD.
001:037
Also
the
LORD
was
angry
with
me
for
your
sakes,
saying,
Thou
also
shalt
not
go
in
thither.
001:038
But
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
which
standeth
before
thee,
he
shall
go
in
thither:
encourage
him:
for
he
shall
cause
Israel
to
inherit
it.
001:039
Moreover
your
little
ones,
which
ye
said
should
be
a
prey,
and
your
children,
which
in
that
day
had
no
knowledge
between
good
and
evil,
they
shall
go
in
thither,
and
unto
them
will
I
give
it,
and
they
shall
possess
it.
001:040
But
as
for
you,
turn
you,
and
take
your
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
Red
sea.
001:041
Then
ye
answered
and
said
unto
me,
We
have
sinned
against
the
LORD,
we
will
go
up
and
fight,
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
our
God
commanded
us.
And
when
ye
had
girded
on
every
man
his
weapons
of
war,
ye
were
ready
to
go
up
into
the
hill.
001:042
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Say
unto
them.
Go
not
up,
neither
fight;
for
I
am
not
among
you;
lest
ye
be
smitten
before
your
enemies.
001:043
So
I
spake
unto
you;
and
ye
would
not
hear,
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
and
went
presumptuously
up
into
the
hill.
001:044
And
the
Amorites,
which
dwelt
in
that
mountain,
came
out
against
you,
and
chased
you,
as
bees
do,
and
destroyed
you
in
Seir,
even
unto
Hormah.
001:045
And
ye
returned
and
wept
before
the
LORD;
but
the
LORD
would
not
hearken
to
your
voice,
nor
give
ear
unto
you.
001:046
So
ye
abode
in
Kadesh
many
days,
according
unto
the
days
that
ye
abode
there.
002:001
Then
we
turned,
and
took
our
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
Red
sea,
as
the
LORD
spake
unto
me:
and
we
compassed
mount
Seir
many
days.
002:002
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
me,
saying,
002:003
Ye
have
compassed
this
mountain
long
enough:
turn
you
northward.
002:004
And
command
thou
the
people,
saying,
Ye
are
to
pass
through
the
coast
of
your
brethren
the
children
of
Esau,
which
dwell
in
Seir;
and
they
shall
be
afraid
of
you:
take
ye
good
heed
unto
yourselves
therefore:
002:005
Meddle
not
with
them;
for
I
will
not
give
you
of
their
land,
no,
not
so
much
as
a
foot
breadth;
because
I
have
given
mount
Seir
unto
Esau
for
a
possession.
002:006
Ye
shall
buy
meat
of
them
for
money,
that
ye
may
eat;
and
ye
shall
also
buy
water
of
them
for
money,
that
ye
may
drink.
002:007
For
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
blessed
thee
in
all
the
works
of
thy
hand:
he
knoweth
thy
walking
through
this
great
wilderness:
these
forty
years
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
been
with
thee;
thou
hast
lacked
nothing.
002:008
And
when
we
passed
by
from
our
brethren
the
children
of
Esau,
which
dwelt
in
Seir,
through
the
way
of
the
plain
from
Elath,
and
from
Eziongaber,
we
turned
and
passed
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
Moab.
002:009
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Distress
not
the
Moabites,
neither
contend
with
them
in
battle:
for
I
will
not
give
thee
of
their
land
for
a
possession;
because
I
have
given
Ar
unto
the
children
of
Lot
for
a
possession.
002:010
The
Emims
dwelt
therein
in
times
past,
a
people
great,
and
many,
and
tall,
as
the
Anakims;
002:011
Which
also
were
accounted
giants,
as
the
Anakims;
but
the
Moabites
called
them
Emims.
002:012
The
Horims
also
dwelt
in
Seir
beforetime;
but
the
children
of
Esau
succeeded
them,
when
they
had
destroyed
them
from
before
them,
and
dwelt
in
their
stead;
as
Israel
did
unto
the
land
of
his
possession,
which
the
LORD
gave
unto
them.
002:013
Now
rise
up,
said
I,
and
get
you
over
the
brook
Zered.
And
we
went
over
the
brook
Zered.
002:014
And
the
space
in
which
we
came
from
