all
the
days
of
thy
life;
and
that
thy
days
may
be
prolonged.
006:003
Hear
therefore,
O
Israel,
and
observe
to
do
it;
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee,
and
that
ye
may
increase
mightily,
as
the
LORD
God
of
thy
fathers
hath
promised
thee,
in
the
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey.
006:004
Hear,
O
Israel:
The
LORD
our
God
is
one
LORD:
006:005
And
thou
shalt
love
the
LORD
thy
God
with
all
thine
heart,
and
with
all
thy
soul,
and
with
all
thy
might.
006:006
And
these
words,
which
I
command
thee
this
day,
shall
be
in
thine
heart:
006:007
And
thou
shalt
teach
them
diligently
unto
thy
children,
and
shalt
talk
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house,
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way,
and
when
thou
liest
down,
and
when
thou
risest
up.
006:008
And
thou
shalt
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
thine
hand,
and
they
shall
be
as
frontlets
between
thine
eyes.
006:009
And
thou
shalt
write
them
upon
the
posts
of
thy
house,
and
on
thy
gates.
006:010
And
it
shall
be,
when
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
have
brought
thee
into
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers,
to
Abraham,
to
Isaac,
and
to
Jacob,
to
give
thee
great
and
goodly
cities,
which
thou
buildedst
not,
006:011
And
houses
full
of
all
good
things,
which
thou
filledst
not,
and
wells
digged,
which
thou
diggedst
not,
vineyards
and
olive
trees,
which
thou
plantedst
not;
when
thou
shalt
have
eaten
and
be
full;
006:012
Then
beware
lest
thou
forget
the
LORD,
which
brought
thee
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
from
the
house
of
bondage.
006:013
Thou
shalt
fear
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
serve
him,
and
shalt
swear
by
his
name.
006:014
Ye
shall
not
go
after
other
gods,
of
the
gods
of
the
people
which
are
round
about
you;
006:015
(For
the
LORD
thy
God
is
a
jealous
God
among
you)
lest
the
anger
of
the
LORD
thy
God
be
kindled
against
thee,
and
destroy
thee
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth.
006:016
Ye
shall
not
tempt
the
LORD
your
God,
as
ye
tempted
him
in
Massah.
006:017
Ye
shall
diligently
keep
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your
God,
and
his
testimonies,
and
his
statutes,
which
he
hath
commanded
thee.
006:018
And
thou
shalt
do
that
which
is
right
and
good
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee,
and
that
thou
mayest
go
in
and
possess
the
good
land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
thy
fathers.
006:019
To
cast
out
all
thine
enemies
from
before
thee,
as
the
LORD
hath
spoken.
006:020
And
when
thy
son
asketh
thee
in
time
to
come,
saying,
What
mean
the
testimonies,
and
the
statutes,
and
the
judgments,
which
the
LORD
our
God
hath
commanded
you?
006:021
Then
thou
shalt
say
unto
thy
son,
We
were
Pharaoh's
bondmen
in
Egypt;
and
the
LORD
brought
us
out
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
hand:
006:022
And
the
LORD
shewed
signs
and
wonders,
great
and
sore,
upon
Egypt,
upon
Pharaoh,
and
upon
all
his
household,
before
our
eyes:
006:023
And
he
brought
us
out
from
thence,
that
he
might
bring
us
in,
to
give
us
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
our
fathers.
006:024
And
the
LORD
commanded
us
to
do
all
these
statutes,
to
fear
the
LORD
our
God,
for
our
good
always,
that
he
might
preserve
us
alive,
as
it
is
at
this
day.
006:025
And
it
shall
be
our
righteousness,
if
we
observe
to
do
all
these
commandments
before
the
LORD
our
God,
as
he
hath
commanded
us.
007:001
When
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
bring
thee
into
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it,
and
hath
cast
out
many
nations
before
thee,
the
Hittites,
and
the
Girgashites,
and
the
Amorites,
and
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites,
seven
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
thou;
007:002
And
when
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
deliver
them
before
thee;
thou
shalt
smite
them,
and
utterly
destroy
them;
thou
shalt
make
no
covenant
with
them,
nor
shew
mercy
unto
them:
007:003
Neither
shalt
thou
make
marriages
with
them;
thy
daughter
thou
shalt
not
give
unto
his
son,
nor
his
daughter
shalt
thou
take
unto
thy
son.
007:004
For
they
will
turn
away
thy
son
from
following
me,
that
they
may
serve
other
gods:
so
will
the
anger
of
the
LORD
be
kindled
against
you,
and
destroy
thee
suddenly.
007:005
But
thus
shall
ye
deal
with
them;
ye
shall
destroy
their
altars,
and
break
down
their
images,
and
cut
down
their
groves,
and
burn
their
graven
images
with
fire.
007:006
For
thou
art
an
holy
people
unto
the
LORD
thy
God:
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
chosen
thee
to
be
a
special
people
unto
himself,
above
all
people
that
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth.
007:007
The
LORD
did
not
set
his
love
upon
you,
nor
choose
you,
because
ye
were
more
in
number
than
any
people;
for
ye
were
the
fewest
of
all
people:
007:008
But
because
the
LORD
loved
you,
and
because
he
would
keep
the
oath
which
he
had
sworn
unto
your
fathers,
hath
the
LORD
brought
you
out
with
a
mighty
hand,
and
redeemed
you
out
of
the
house
of
bondmen,
from
the
hand
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt.
007:009
Know
therefore
that
the
LORD
thy
God,
he
is
God,
the
faithful
God,
which
keepeth
covenant
and
mercy
with
them
that
love
him
and
keep
his
commandments
to
a
thousand
generations;
007:010
And
repayeth
them
that
hate
him
to
their
face,
to
destroy
them:
he
will
not
be
slack
to
him
that
hateth
him,
he
will
repay
him
to
his
face.
007:011
Thou
shalt
therefore
keep
the
commandments,
and
the
statutes,
and
the
judgments,
which
I
command
thee
this
day,
to
do
them.
007:012
Wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
ye
hearken
to
these
judgments,
and
keep,
and
do
them,
that
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
keep
unto
thee
the
covenant
and
the
mercy
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers:
007:013
And
he
will
love
thee,
and
bless
thee,
and
multiply
thee:
he
will
also
bless
the
fruit
of
thy
womb,
and
the
fruit
of
thy
land,
thy
corn,
and
thy
wine,
and
thine
oil,
the
increase
of
thy
kine,
and
the
flocks
of
thy
sheep,
in
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
give
thee.
007:014
Thou
shalt
be
blessed
above
all
people:
there
shall
not
be
male
or
female
barren
among
you,
or
among
your
cattle.
007:015
And
the
LORD
will
take
away
from
thee
all
sickness,
and
will
put
none
of
the
evil
diseases
of
Egypt,
which
thou
knowest,
upon
thee;
but
will
lay
them
upon
all
them
that
hate
thee.
007:016
And
thou
shalt
consume
all
the
people
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
deliver
thee;
thine
eye
shall
have
no
pity
upon
them:
neither
shalt
thou
serve
their
gods;
for
that
will
be
a
snare
unto
thee.
007:017
If
thou
shalt
say
in
thine
heart,
These
nations
are
more
than
I;
how
can
I
dispossess
them?
007:018
Thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
them:
but
shalt
well
remember
what
the
LORD
thy
God
did
unto
Pharaoh,
and
unto
all
Egypt;
007:019
The
great
temptations
which
thine
eyes
saw,
and
the
signs,
and
the
wonders,
and
the
mighty
hand,
and
the
stretched
out
arm,
whereby
the
LORD
thy
God
brought
thee
out:
so
shall
the
LORD
thy
God
do
unto
all
the
people
of
whom
thou
art
afraid.
007:020
Moreover
the
LORD
thy
God
will
send
the
hornet
among
them,
until
they
that
are
left,
and
hide
themselves
from
thee,
be
destroyed.
007:021
Thou
shalt
not
be
affrighted
at
them:
for
the
LORD
thy
God
is
among
you,
a
mighty
God
and
terrible.
007:022
And
the
LORD
thy
God
will
put
out
those
nations
before
thee
by
little
and
little:
thou
mayest
not
consume
them
at
once,
lest
the
beasts
of
the
field
increase
upon
thee.
007:023
But
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
deliver
them
unto
thee,
and
shall
destroy
them
with
a
mighty
destruction,
until
they
be
destroyed.
007:024
And
he
shall
deliver
their
kings
into
thine
hand,
and
thou
shalt
destroy
their
name
from
under
heaven:
there
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
thee,
until
thou
have
destroyed
them.
007:025
The
graven
images
of
their
gods
shall
ye
burn
with
fire:
thou
shalt
not
desire
the
silver
or
gold
that
is
on
them,
nor
take
it
unto
thee,
lest
thou
be
snared
therin:
for
it
is
an
abomination
to
the
LORD
thy
God.
007:026
Neither
shalt
thou
bring
an
abomination
into
thine
house,
lest
thou
be
a
cursed
thing
like
it:
but
thou
shalt
utterly
detest
it,
and
thou
shalt
utterly
abhor
it;
for
it
is
a
cursed
thing.
008:001
All
the
commandments
which
I
command
thee
this
day
shall
ye
observe
to
do,
that
ye
may
live,
and
multiply,
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
your
fathers.
008:002
And
thou
shalt
remember
all
the
way
which
the
LORD
thy
God
led
thee
these
forty
years
in
the
wilderness,
to
humble
thee,
and
to
prove
thee,
to
know
what
was
in
thine
heart,
whether
thou
wouldest
keep
his
commandments,
or
no.
008:003
And
he
humbled
thee,
and
suffered
thee
to
hunger,
and
fed
thee
with
manna,
which
thou
knewest
not,
neither
did
thy
fathers
know;
that
he
might
make
thee
know
that
man
doth
not
live
by
bread
only,
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
LORD
doth
man
live.
008:004
Thy
raiment
waxed
not
old
upon
thee,
neither
did
thy
foot
swell,
these
forty
years.
008:005
Thou
shalt
also
consider
in
thine
heart,
that,
as
a
man
chasteneth
his
son,
so
the
LORD
thy
God
chasteneth
thee.
008:006
Therefore
thou
shalt
keep
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
walk
in
his
ways,
and
to
fear
him.
008:007
For
the
LORD
thy
God
bringeth
thee
into
a
good
land,
a
land
of
brooks
of
water,
of
fountains
and
depths
that
spring
out
of
valleys
and
hills;
008:008
A
land
of
wheat,
and
barley,
and
vines,
and
fig
trees,
and
pomegranates;
a
land
of
oil
olive,
and
honey;
008:009
A
land
wherein
thou
shalt
eat
bread
without
scarceness,
thou
shalt
not
lack
any
thing
in
it;
a
land
whose
stones
are
iron,
and
out
of
whose
hills
thou
mayest
dig
brass.
008:010
When
thou
hast
eaten
and
art
full,
then
thou
shalt
bless
the
LORD
thy
God
for
the
good
land
which
he
hath
given
thee.
008:011
Beware
that
thou
forget
not
the
LORD
thy
God,
in
not
keeping
his
commandments,
and
his
judgments,
and
his
statutes,
which
I
command
thee
this
day:
008:012
Lest
when
thou
hast
eaten
and
art
full,
and
hast
built
goodly
houses,
and
dwelt
therein;
008:013
And
when
thy
herds
and
thy
flocks
multiply,
and
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
is
multiplied,
and
all
that
thou
hast
is
multiplied;
008:014
Then
thine
heart
be
lifted
up,
and
thou
forget
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
brought
thee
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
from
the
house
of
bondage;
008:015
Who
led
thee
through
that
great
and
terrible
wilderness,
wherein
were
fiery
serpents,
and
scorpions,
and
drought,
where
there
was
no
water;
who
brought
thee
forth
water
out
of
the
rock
of
flint;
008:016
Who
fed
thee
in
the
wilderness
with
manna,
which
thy
fathers
knew
not,
that
he
might
humble
thee,
and
that
he
might
prove
thee,
to
do
thee
good
at
thy
latter
end;
008:017
And
thou
say
in
thine
heart,
My
power
and
the
might
of
mine
hand
hath
gotten
me
this
wealth.
008:018
But
thou
shalt
remember
the
LORD
thy
God:
for
it
is
he
that
giveth
thee
power
to
get
wealth,
that
he
may
establish
his
covenant
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers,
as
it
is
this
day.
008:019
And
it
shall
be,
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
walk
after
other
gods,
and
serve
them,
and
worship
them,
I
testify
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
perish.
008:020
As
the
nations
which
the
LORD
destroyeth
before
your
face,
so
shall
ye
perish;
because
ye
would
not
be
obedient
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD
your
God.
009:001
Hear,
O
Israel:
Thou
art
to
pass
over
Jordan
this
day,
to
go
in
to
possess
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
thyself,
cities
great
and
fenced
up
to
heaven,
009:002
A
people
great
and
tall,
the
children
of
the
Anakims,
whom
thou
knowest,
and
of
whom
thou
hast
heard
say,
Who
can
stand
before
the
children
of
Anak!
009:003
Understand
therefore
this
day,
that
the
LORD
thy
God
is
he
which
goeth
over
before
thee;
as
a
consuming
fire
he
shall
destroy
them,
and
he
shall
bring
them
down
before
thy
face:
so
shalt
thou
drive
them
out,
and
destroy
them
quickly,
as
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
thee.
009:004
Speak
not
thou
in
thine
heart,
after
that
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
cast
them
out
from
before
thee,
saying,
For
my
righteousness
the
LORD
hath
brought
me
in
to
possess
this
land:
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
LORD
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee.
009:005
Not
for
thy
righteousness,
or
for
the
uprightness
of
thine
heart,
dost
thou
go
to
possess
their
land:
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
LORD
thy
God
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee,
and
that
he
may
perform
the
word
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
thy
fathers,
Abraham,
Isaac,
and
Jacob.
009:006
Understand
therefore,
that
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
not
this
good
land
to
possess
it
for
thy
righteousness;
for
thou
art
a
stiffnecked
people.
009:007
Remember,
and
forget
not,
how
thou
provokedst
the
LORD
thy
God
to
wrath
in
the
wilderness:
from
the
day
that
thou
didst
depart
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
until
ye
came
unto
this
place,
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
LORD.
009:008
Also
in
Horeb
ye
provoked
the
LORD
to
wrath,
so
that
the
LORD
was
angry
with
you
to
have
destroyed
you.
009:009
When
I
was
gone
up
into
the
mount
to
receive
the
tables
of
stone,
even
the
tables
of
the
covenant
which
the
LORD
made
with
you,
then
I
abode
in
the
mount
forty
days
and
forty
nights,
I
neither
did
eat
bread
nor
drink
water:
009:010
And
the
LORD
delivered
unto
me
two
tables
of
stone
written
with
the
finger
of
God;
and
on
them
was
written
according
to
all
the
words,
which
the
LORD
spake
with
you
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
assembly.
009:011
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
forty
days
and
forty
nights,
that
the
LORD
gave
me
the
two
tables
of
stone,
even
the
tables
of
the
covenant.
009:012
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Arise,
get
thee
down
quickly
from
hence;
for
thy
people
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
Egypt
have
corrupted
themselves;
they
are
quickly
turned
aside
out
of
the
way
which
I
commanded
them;
they
have
made
them
a
molten
image.
009:013
Furthermore
the
LORD
spake
unto
me,
saying,
I
have
seen
this
people,
and,
behold,
it
is
a
stiffnecked
people:
009:014
Let
me
alone,
that
I
may
destroy
them,
and
blot
out
their
name
from
under
heaven:
and
I
will
make
of
thee
a
nation
mightier
and
greater
than
they.
009:015
So
I
turned
and
came
down
from
the
mount,
and
the
mount
burned
with
fire:
and
the
two
tables
of
the
covenant
were
in
my
two
hands.
009:016
And
I
looked,
and,
behold,
ye
had
sinned
against
the
LORD
your
God,
and
had
made
you
a
molten
calf:
ye
had
turned
aside
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
the
LORD
had
commanded
you.
009:017
And
I
took
the
two
tables,
and
cast
them
out
of
my
two
hands,
and
brake
them
before
your
eyes.
009:018
And
I
fell
down
before
the
LORD,
as
at
the
first,
forty
days
and
forty
nights:
I
did
neither
eat
bread,
nor
drink
water,
because
of
all
your
sins
which
ye
sinned,
in
doing
wickedly
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
to
provoke
him
to
anger.
009:019
For
I
was
afraid
of
the
anger
and
hot
displeasure,
wherewith
the
LORD
was
wroth
against
you
to
destroy
you.
But
the
LORD
hearkened
unto
me
at
that
time
also.
009:020
And
the
LORD
was
very
angry
with
Aaron
to
have
destroyed
him:
and
I
prayed
for
Aaron
also
the
same
time.
009:021
And
I
took
your
sin,
the
calf
which
ye
had
made,
and
burnt
it
with
fire,
and
stamped
it,
and
ground
it
very
small,
even
until
it
was
as
small
as
dust:
and
I
cast
the
dust
thereof
into
the
brook
that
descended
out
of
the
mount.
009:022
And
at
Taberah,
and
at
Massah,
and
at
Kibrothhattaavah,
ye
provoked
the
LORD
to
wrath.
009:023
Likewise
when
the
LORD
sent
you
from
Kadeshbarnea,
saying,
Go
up
and
possess
the
land
which
I
have
given
you;
then
ye
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
your
God,
and
ye
believed
him
not,
nor
hearkened
to
his
voice.
009:024
Ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
LORD
from
the
day
that
I
knew
you.
009:025
Thus
I
fell
down
before
the
LORD
forty
days
and
forty
nights,
as
I
fell
down
at
the
first;
because
the
LORD
had
said
he
would
destroy
you.
009:026
I
prayed
therefore
unto
the
LORD,
and
said,
O
Lord
GOD,
destroy
not
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance,
which
thou
hast
redeemed
through
thy
greatness,
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
hand.
009:027
Remember
thy
servants,
Abraham,
Isaac,
and
Jacob;
look
not
unto
the
stubbornness
of
this
people,
nor
to
their
wickedness,
nor
to
their
sin:
009:028
Lest
the
land
whence
thou
broughtest
us
out
say,
Because
the
LORD
was
not
able
to
bring
them
into
the
land
which
he
promised
them,
and
because
he
hated
them,
he
hath
brought
them
out
to
slay
them
in
the
wilderness.
009:029
Yet
they
are
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance,
which
thou
broughtest
out
by
thy
mighty
power
and
by
thy
stretched
out
arm.
010:001
At
that
time
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Hew
thee
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first,
and
come
up
unto
me
into
the
mount,
and
make
thee
an
ark
of
wood.
010:002
And
I
will
write
on
the
tables
the
words
that
were
in
the
first
tables
which
thou
brakest,
and
thou
shalt
put
them
in
the
ark.
010:003
And
I
made
an
ark
of
shittim
wood,
and
hewed
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first,
and
went
up
into
the
mount,
having
the
two
tables
in
mine
hand.
010:004
And
he
wrote
on
the
tables,
according
to
the
first
writing,
the
ten
commandments,
which
the
LORD
spake
unto
you
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
assembly:
and
the
LORD
gave
them
unto
me.
010:005
And
I
turned
myself
and
came
down
from
the
mount,
and
put
the
tables
in
the
ark
which
I
had
made;
and
there
they
be,
as
the
LORD
commanded
me.
010:006
And
the
children
of
Israel
took
their
journey
from
Beeroth
of
the
children
of
Jaakan
to
Mosera:
there
Aaron
died,
and
there
he
was
buried;
and
Eleazar
his
son
ministered
in
the
priest's
office
in
his
stead.
010:007
From
thence
they
journeyed
unto
Gudgodah;
and
from
Gudgodah
to
Jotbath,
a
land
of
rivers
of
waters.
010:008
At
that
time
the
LORD
separated
the
tribe
of
Levi,
to
bear
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
to
stand
before
the
LORD
to
minister
unto
him,
and
to
bless
in
his
name,
unto
this
day.
010:009
Wherefore
Levi
hath
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
his
brethren;
the
LORD
is
his
inheritance,
according
as
the
LORD
thy
God
promised
him.
010:010
And
I
stayed
in
the
mount,
according
to
the
first
time,
forty
days
and
forty
nights;
and
the
LORD
hearkened
unto
me
at
that
time
also,
and
the
LORD
would
not
destroy
thee.
010:011
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
Arise,
take
thy
journey
before
the
people,
that
they
may
go
in
and
possess
the
land,
which
I
sware
unto
their
fathers
to
give
unto
them.
010:012
And
now,
Israel,
what
doth
the
LORD
thy
God
require
of
thee,
but
to
fear
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
walk
in
all
his
ways,
and
to
love
him,
and
to
serve
the
LORD
thy
God
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul,
010:013
To
keep
the
commandments
of
the
LORD,
and
his
statutes,
which
I
command
thee
this
day
for
thy
good?
010:014
Behold,
the
heaven
and
the
heaven
of
heavens
is
the
LORD's
thy
God,
the
earth
also,
with
all
that
therein
is.
010:015
Only
the
LORD
had
a
delight
in
thy
fathers
to
love
them,
and
he
chose
their
seed
after
them,
even
you
above
all
people,
as
it
is
this
day.
010:016
Circumcise
therefore
the
foreskin
of
your
heart,
and
be
no
more
stiffnecked.
010:017
For
the
LORD
your
God
is
God
of
gods,
and
Lord
of
lords,
a
great
God,
a
mighty,
and
a
terrible,
which
regardeth
not
persons,
nor
taketh
reward:
010:018
He
doth
execute
the
judgment
of
the
fatherless
and
widow,
and
loveth
the
stranger,
in
giving
him
food
and
raiment.
010:019
Love
ye
therefore
the
stranger:
for
ye
were
strangers
in
the
land
of
Egypt.
010:020
Thou
shalt
fear
the
LORD
thy
God;
him
shalt
thou
serve,
and
to
him
shalt
thou
cleave,
and
swear
by
his
name.
010:021
He
is
thy
praise,
and
he
is
thy
God,
that
hath
done
for
thee
these
great
and
terrible
things,
which
thine
eyes
have
seen.
010:022
Thy
fathers
went
down
into
Egypt
with
threescore
and
ten
persons;
and
now
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
made
thee
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
multitude.
011:001
Therefore
thou
shalt
love
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
keep
his
charge,
and
his
statutes,
and
his
judgments,
and
his
commandments,
alway.
011:002
And
know
ye
this
day:
for
I
speak
not
with
your
children
which
have
not
known,
and
which
have
not
seen
the
chastisement
of
the
LORD
your
God,
his
greatness,
his
mighty
hand,
and
his
stretched
out
arm,
011:003
And
his
miracles,
and
his
acts,
which
he
did
in
the
midst
of
Egypt
unto
Pharaoh
the
king
of
Egypt,
and
unto
all
his
land;
011:004
And
what
he
did
unto
the
army
of
Egypt,
unto
their
horses,
and
to
their
chariots;
how
he
made
the
water
of
the
Red
sea
to
overflow
them
as
they
pursued
after
you,
and
how
the
LORD
hath
destroyed
them
unto
this
day;
011:005
And
what
he
did
unto
you
in
the
wilderness,
until
ye
came
into
this
place;
011:006
And
what
he
did
unto
Dathan
and
Abiram,
the
sons
of
Eliab,
the
son
of
Reuben:
how
the
earth
opened
her
mouth,
and
swallowed
them
up,
and
their
households,
and
their
tents,
and
all
the
substance
that
was
in
their
possession,
in
the
midst
of
all
Israel:
011:007
But
your
eyes
have
seen
all
the
great
acts
of
the
LORD
which
he
did.
011:008
Therefore
shall
ye
keep
all
the
commandments
which
I
command
you
this
day,
that
ye
may
be
strong,
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land,
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it;
011:009
And
that
ye
may
prolong
your
days
in
the
land,
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
give
unto
them
and
to
their
seed,
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey.
011:010
For
the
land,
whither
thou
goest
in
to
possess
it,
is
not
as
the
land
of
Egypt,
from
whence
ye
came
out,
where
thou
sowedst
thy
seed,
and
wateredst
it
with
thy
foot,
as
a
garden
of
herbs:
011:011
But
the
land,
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it,
is
a
land
of
hills
and
valleys,
and
drinketh
water
of
the
rain
of
heaven:
011:012
A
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
careth
for:
the
eyes
of
the
LORD
thy
God
are
always
upon
it,
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
even
unto
the
end
of
the
year.
011:013
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
ye
shall
hearken
diligently
unto
my
commandments
which
I
command
you
this
day,
to
love
the
LORD
your
God,
and
to
serve
him
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul,
011:014
That
