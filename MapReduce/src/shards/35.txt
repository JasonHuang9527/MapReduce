I
will
give
you
the
rain
of
your
land
in
his
due
season,
the
first
rain
and
the
latter
rain,
that
thou
mayest
gather
in
thy
corn,
and
thy
wine,
and
thine
oil.
011:015
And
I
will
send
grass
in
thy
fields
for
thy
cattle,
that
thou
mayest
eat
and
be
full.
011:016
Take
heed
to
yourselves,
that
your
heart
be
not
deceived,
and
ye
turn
aside,
and
serve
other
gods,
and
worship
them;
011:017
And
then
the
LORD's
wrath
be
kindled
against
you,
and
he
shut
up
the
heaven,
that
there
be
no
rain,
and
that
the
land
yield
not
her
fruit;
and
lest
ye
perish
quickly
from
off
the
good
land
which
the
LORD
giveth
you.
011:018
Therefore
shall
ye
lay
up
these
my
words
in
your
heart
and
in
your
soul,
and
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
your
hand,
that
they
may
be
as
frontlets
between
your
eyes.
011:019
And
ye
shall
teach
them
your
children,
speaking
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house,
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way,
when
thou
liest
down,
and
when
thou
risest
up.
011:020
And
thou
shalt
write
them
upon
the
door
posts
of
thine
house,
and
upon
thy
gates:
011:021
That
your
days
may
be
multiplied,
and
the
days
of
your
children,
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
give
them,
as
the
days
of
heaven
upon
the
earth.
011:022
For
if
ye
shall
diligently
keep
all
these
commandments
which
I
command
you,
to
do
them,
to
love
the
LORD
your
God,
to
walk
in
all
his
ways,
and
to
cleave
unto
him;
011:023
Then
will
the
LORD
drive
out
all
these
nations
from
before
you,
and
ye
shall
possess
greater
nations
and
mightier
than
yourselves.
011:024
Every
place
whereon
the
soles
of
your
feet
shall
tread
shall
be
yours:
from
the
wilderness
and
Lebanon,
from
the
river,
the
river
Euphrates,
even
unto
the
uttermost
sea
shall
your
coast
be.
011:025
There
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
you:
for
the
LORD
your
God
shall
lay
the
fear
of
you
and
the
dread
of
you
upon
all
the
land
that
ye
shall
tread
upon,
as
he
hath
said
unto
you.
011:026
Behold,
I
set
before
you
this
day
a
blessing
and
a
curse;
011:027
A
blessing,
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your
God,
which
I
command
you
this
day:
011:028
And
a
curse,
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your
God,
but
turn
aside
out
of
the
way
which
I
command
you
this
day,
to
go
after
other
gods,
which
ye
have
not
known.
011:029
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
brought
thee
in
unto
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it,
that
thou
shalt
put
the
blessing
upon
mount
Gerizim,
and
the
curse
upon
mount
Ebal.
011:030
Are
they
not
on
the
other
side
Jordan,
by
the
way
where
the
sun
goeth
down,
in
the
land
of
the
Canaanites,
which
dwell
in
the
champaign
over
against
Gilgal,
beside
the
plains
of
Moreh?
011:031
For
ye
shall
pass
over
Jordan
to
go
in
to
possess
the
land
which
the
LORD
your
God
giveth
you,
and
ye
shall
possess
it,
and
dwell
therein.
011:032
And
ye
shall
observe
to
do
all
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
I
set
before
you
this
day.
012:001
These
are
the
statutes
and
judgments,
which
ye
shall
observe
to
do
in
the
land,
which
the
LORD
God
of
thy
fathers
giveth
thee
to
possess
it,
all
the
days
that
ye
live
upon
the
earth.
012:002
Ye
shall
utterly
destroy
all
the
places,
wherein
the
nations
which
ye
shall
possess
served
their
gods,
upon
the
high
mountains,
and
upon
the
hills,
and
under
every
green
tree:
012:003
And
ye
shall
overthrow
their
altars,
and
break
their
pillars,
and
burn
their
groves
with
fire;
and
ye
shall
hew
down
the
graven
images
of
their
gods,
and
destroy
the
names
of
them
out
of
that
place.
012:004
Ye
shall
not
do
so
unto
the
LORD
your
God.
012:005
But
unto
the
place
which
the
LORD
your
God
shall
choose
out
of
all
your
tribes
to
put
his
name
there,
even
unto
his
habitation
shall
ye
seek,
and
thither
thou
shalt
come:
012:006
And
thither
ye
shall
bring
your
burnt
offerings,
and
your
sacrifices,
and
your
tithes,
and
heave
offerings
of
your
hand,
and
your
vows,
and
your
freewill
offerings,
and
the
firstlings
of
your
herds
and
of
your
flocks:
012:007
And
there
ye
shall
eat
before
the
LORD
your
God,
and
ye
shall
rejoice
in
all
that
ye
put
your
hand
unto,
ye
and
your
households,
wherein
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
blessed
thee.
012:008
Ye
shall
not
do
after
all
the
things
that
we
do
here
this
day,
every
man
whatsoever
is
right
in
his
own
eyes.
012:009
For
ye
are
not
as
yet
come
to
the
rest
and
to
the
inheritance,
which
the
LORD
your
God
giveth
you.
012:010
But
when
ye
go
over
Jordan,
and
dwell
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
your
God
giveth
you
to
inherit,
and
when
he
giveth
you
rest
from
all
your
enemies
round
about,
so
that
ye
dwell
in
safety;
012:011
Then
there
shall
be
a
place
which
the
LORD
your
God
shall
choose
to
cause
his
name
to
dwell
there;
thither
shall
ye
bring
all
that
I
command
you;
your
burnt
offerings,
and
your
sacrifices,
your
tithes,
and
the
heave
offering
of
your
hand,
and
all
your
choice
vows
which
ye
vow
unto
the
LORD:
012:012
And
ye
shall
rejoice
before
the
LORD
your
God,
ye,
and
your
sons,
and
your
daughters,
and
your
menservants,
and
your
maidservants,
and
the
Levite
that
is
within
your
gates;
forasmuch
as
he
hath
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
you.
012:013
Take
heed
to
thyself
that
thou
offer
not
thy
burnt
offerings
in
every
place
that
thou
seest:
012:014
But
in
the
place
which
the
LORD
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
tribes,
there
thou
shalt
offer
thy
burnt
offerings,
and
there
thou
shalt
do
all
that
I
command
thee.
012:015
Notwithstanding
thou
mayest
kill
and
eat
flesh
in
all
thy
gates,
whatsoever
thy
soul
lusteth
after,
according
to
the
blessing
of
the
LORD
thy
God
which
he
hath
given
thee:
the
unclean
and
the
clean
may
eat
thereof,
as
of
the
roebuck,
and
as
of
the
hart.
012:016
Only
ye
shall
not
eat
the
blood;
ye
shall
pour
it
upon
the
earth
as
water.
012:017
Thou
mayest
not
eat
within
thy
gates
the
tithe
of
thy
corn,
or
of
thy
wine,
or
of
thy
oil,
or
the
firstlings
of
thy
herds
or
of
thy
flock,
nor
any
of
thy
vows
which
thou
vowest,
nor
thy
freewill
offerings,
or
heave
offering
of
thine
hand:
012:018
But
thou
must
eat
them
before
the
LORD
thy
God
in
the
place
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
choose,
thou,
and
thy
son,
and
thy
daughter,
and
thy
manservant,
and
thy
maidservant,
and
the
Levite
that
is
within
thy
gates:
and
thou
shalt
rejoice
before
the
LORD
thy
God
in
all
that
thou
puttest
thine
hands
unto.
012:019
Take
heed
to
thyself
that
thou
forsake
not
the
Levite
as
long
as
thou
livest
upon
the
earth.
012:020
When
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
enlarge
thy
border,
as
he
hath
promised
thee,
and
thou
shalt
say,
I
will
eat
flesh,
because
thy
soul
longeth
to
eat
flesh;
thou
mayest
eat
flesh,
whatsoever
thy
soul
lusteth
after.
012:021
If
the
place
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
chosen
to
put
his
name
there
be
too
far
from
thee,
then
thou
shalt
kill
of
thy
herd
and
of
thy
flock,
which
the
LORD
hath
given
thee,
as
I
have
commanded
thee,
and
thou
shalt
eat
in
thy
gates
whatsoever
thy
soul
lusteth
after.
012:022
Even
as
the
roebuck
and
the
hart
is
eaten,
so
thou
shalt
eat
them:
the
unclean
and
the
clean
shall
eat
of
them
alike.
012:023
Only
be
sure
that
thou
eat
not
the
blood:
for
the
blood
is
the
life;
and
thou
mayest
not
eat
the
life
with
the
flesh.
012:024
Thou
shalt
not
eat
it;
thou
shalt
pour
it
upon
the
earth
as
water.
012:025
Thou
shalt
not
eat
it;
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee,
and
with
thy
children
after
thee,
when
thou
shalt
do
that
which
is
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD.
012:026
Only
thy
holy
things
which
thou
hast,
and
thy
vows,
thou
shalt
take,
and
go
unto
the
place
which
the
LORD
shall
choose:
012:027
And
thou
shalt
offer
thy
burnt
offerings,
the
flesh
and
the
blood,
upon
the
altar
of
the
LORD
thy
God:
and
the
blood
of
thy
sacrifices
shall
be
poured
out
upon
the
altar
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
flesh.
012:028
Observe
and
hear
all
these
words
which
I
command
thee,
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee,
and
with
thy
children
after
thee
for
ever,
when
thou
doest
that
which
is
good
and
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
012:029
When
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
cut
off
the
nations
from
before
thee,
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
them,
and
thou
succeedest
them,
and
dwellest
in
their
land;
012:030
Take
heed
to
thyself
that
thou
be
not
snared
by
following
them,
after
that
they
be
destroyed
from
before
thee;
and
that
thou
enquire
not
after
their
gods,
saying,
How
did
these
nations
serve
their
gods?
even
so
will
I
do
likewise.
012:031
Thou
shalt
not
do
so
unto
the
LORD
thy
God:
for
every
abomination
to
the
LORD,
which
he
hateth,
have
they
done
unto
their
gods;
for
even
their
sons
and
their
daughters
they
have
burnt
in
the
fire
to
their
gods.
012:032
What
thing
soever
I
command
you,
observe
to
do
it:
thou
shalt
not
add
thereto,
nor
diminish
from
it.
013:001
If
there
arise
among
you
a
prophet,
or
a
dreamer
of
dreams,
and
giveth
thee
a
sign
or
a
wonder,
013:002
And
the
sign
or
the
wonder
come
to
pass,
whereof
he
spake
unto
thee,
saying,
Let
us
go
after
other
gods,
which
thou
hast
not
known,
and
let
us
serve
them;
013:003
Thou
shalt
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
that
prophet,
or
that
dreamer
of
dreams:
for
the
LORD
your
God
proveth
you,
to
know
whether
ye
love
the
LORD
your
God
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul.
013:004
Ye
shall
walk
after
the
LORD
your
God,
and
fear
him,
and
keep
his
commandments,
and
obey
his
voice,
and
ye
shall
serve
him,
and
cleave
unto
him.
013:005
And
that
prophet,
or
that
dreamer
of
dreams,
shall
be
put
to
death;
because
he
hath
spoken
to
turn
you
away
from
the
LORD
your
God,
which
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
redeemed
you
out
of
the
house
of
bondage,
to
thrust
thee
out
of
the
way
which
the
LORD
thy
God
commanded
thee
to
walk
in.
So
shalt
thou
put
the
evil
away
from
the
midst
of
thee.
013:006
If
thy
brother,
the
son
of
thy
mother,
or
thy
son,
or
thy
daughter,
or
the
wife
of
thy
bosom,
or
thy
friend,
which
is
as
thine
own
soul,
entice
thee
secretly,
saying,
Let
us
go
and
serve
other
gods,
which
thou
hast
not
known,
thou,
nor
thy
fathers;
013:007
Namely,
of
the
gods
of
the
people
which
are
round
about
you,
nigh
unto
thee,
or
far
off
from
thee,
from
the
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other
end
of
the
earth;
013:008
Thou
shalt
not
consent
unto
him,
nor
hearken
unto
him;
neither
shall
thine
eye
pity
him,
neither
shalt
thou
spare,
neither
shalt
thou
conceal
him:
013:009
But
thou
shalt
surely
kill
him;
thine
hand
shall
be
first
upon
him
to
put
him
to
death,
and
afterwards
the
hand
of
all
the
people.
013:010
And
thou
shalt
stone
him
with
stones,
that
he
die;
because
he
hath
sought
to
thrust
thee
away
from
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
from
the
house
of
bondage.
013:011
And
all
Israel
shall
hear,
and
fear,
and
shall
do
no
more
any
such
wickedness
as
this
is
among
you.
013:012
If
thou
shalt
hear
say
in
one
of
thy
cities,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
given
thee
to
dwell
there,
saying,
013:013
Certain
men,
the
children
of
Belial,
are
gone
out
from
among
you,
and
have
withdrawn
the
inhabitants
of
their
city,
saying,
Let
us
go
and
serve
other
gods,
which
ye
have
not
known;
013:014
Then
shalt
thou
enquire,
and
make
search,
and
ask
diligently;
and,
behold,
if
it
be
truth,
and
the
thing
certain,
that
such
abomination
is
wrought
among
you;
013:015
Thou
shalt
surely
smite
the
inhabitants
of
that
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
destroying
it
utterly,
and
all
that
is
therein,
and
the
cattle
thereof,
with
the
edge
of
the
sword.
013:016
And
thou
shalt
gather
all
the
spoil
of
it
into
the
midst
of
the
street
thereof,
and
shalt
burn
with
fire
the
city,
and
all
the
spoil
thereof
every
whit,
for
the
LORD
thy
God:
and
it
shall
be
an
heap
for
ever;
it
shall
not
be
built
again.
013:017
And
there
shall
cleave
nought
of
the
cursed
thing
to
thine
hand:
that
the
LORD
may
turn
from
the
fierceness
of
his
anger,
and
shew
thee
mercy,
and
have
compassion
upon
thee,
and
multiply
thee,
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thy
fathers;
013:018
When
thou
shalt
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
keep
all
his
commandments
which
I
command
thee
this
day,
to
do
that
which
is
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
014:001
Ye
are
the
children
of
the
LORD
your
God:
ye
shall
not
cut
yourselves,
nor
make
any
baldness
between
your
eyes
for
the
dead.
014:002
For
thou
art
an
holy
people
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
the
LORD
hath
chosen
thee
to
be
a
peculiar
people
unto
himself,
above
all
the
nations
that
are
upon
the
earth.
014:003
Thou
shalt
not
eat
any
abominable
thing.
014:004
These
are
the
beasts
which
ye
shall
eat:
the
ox,
the
sheep,
and
the
goat,
014:005
The
hart,
and
the
roebuck,
and
the
fallow
deer,
and
the
wild
goat,
and
the
pygarg,
and
the
wild
ox,
and
the
chamois.
014:006
And
every
beast
that
parteth
the
hoof,
and
cleaveth
the
cleft
into
two
claws,
and
cheweth
the
cud
among
the
beasts,
that
ye
shall
eat.
014:007
Nevertheless
these
ye
shall
not
eat
of
them
that
chew
the
cud,
or
of
them
that
divide
the
cloven
hoof;
as
the
camel,
and
the
hare,
and
the
coney:
for
they
chew
the
cud,
but
divide
not
the
hoof;
therefore
they
are
unclean
unto
you.
014:008
And
the
swine,
because
it
divideth
the
hoof,
yet
cheweth
not
the
cud,
it
is
unclean
unto
you:
ye
shall
not
eat
of
their
flesh,
nor
touch
their
dead
carcase.
014:009
These
ye
shall
eat
of
all
that
are
in
the
waters:
all
that
have
fins
and
scales
shall
ye
eat:
014:010
And
whatsoever
hath
not
fins
and
scales
ye
may
not
eat;
it
is
unclean
unto
you.
014:011
Of
all
clean
birds
ye
shall
eat.
014:012
But
these
are
they
of
which
ye
shall
not
eat:
the
eagle,
and
the
ossifrage,
and
the
ospray,
014:013
And
the
glede,
and
the
kite,
and
the
vulture
after
his
kind,
014:014
And
every
raven
after
his
kind,
014:015
And
the
owl,
and
the
night
hawk,
and
the
cuckow,
and
the
hawk
after
his
kind,
014:016
The
little
owl,
and
the
great
owl,
and
the
swan,
014:017
And
the
pelican,
and
the
gier
eagle,
and
the
cormorant,
014:018
And
the
stork,
and
the
heron
after
her
kind,
and
the
lapwing,
and
the
bat.
014:019
And
every
creeping
thing
that
flieth
is
unclean
unto
you:
they
shall
not
be
eaten.
014:020
But
of
all
clean
fowls
ye
may
eat.
014:021
Ye
shall
not
eat
of
anything
that
dieth
of
itself:
thou
shalt
give
it
unto
the
stranger
that
is
in
thy
gates,
that
he
may
eat
it;
or
thou
mayest
sell
it
unto
an
alien:
for
thou
art
an
holy
people
unto
the
LORD
thy
God.
Thou
shalt
not
seethe
a
kid
in
his
mother's
milk.
014:022
Thou
shalt
truly
tithe
all
the
increase
of
thy
seed,
that
the
field
bringeth
forth
year
by
year.
014:023
And
thou
shalt
eat
before
the
LORD
thy
God,
in
the
place
which
he
shall
choose
to
place
his
name
there,
the
tithe
of
thy
corn,
of
thy
wine,
and
of
thine
oil,
and
the
firstlings
of
thy
herds
and
of
thy
flocks;
that
thou
mayest
learn
to
fear
the
LORD
thy
God
always.
014:024
And
if
the
way
be
too
long
for
thee,
so
that
thou
art
not
able
to
carry
it;
or
if
the
place
be
too
far
from
thee,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
choose
to
set
his
name
there,
when
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
blessed
thee:
014:025
Then
shalt
thou
turn
it
into
money,
and
bind
up
the
money
in
thine
hand,
and
shalt
go
unto
the
place
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
choose:
014:026
And
thou
shalt
bestow
that
money
for
whatsoever
thy
soul
lusteth
after,
for
oxen,
or
for
sheep,
or
for
wine,
or
for
strong
drink,
or
for
whatsoever
thy
soul
desireth:
and
thou
shalt
eat
there
before
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
thou
shalt
rejoice,
thou,
and
thine
household,
014:027
And
the
Levite
that
is
within
thy
gates;
thou
shalt
not
forsake
him;
for
he
hath
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
thee.
014:028
At
the
end
of
three
years
thou
shalt
bring
forth
all
the
tithe
of
thine
increase
the
same
year,
and
shalt
lay
it
up
within
thy
gates:
014:029
And
the
Levite,
(because
he
hath
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
thee,)
and
the
stranger,
and
the
fatherless,
and
the
widow,
which
are
within
thy
gates,
shall
come,
and
shall
eat
and
be
satisfied;
that
the
LORD
thy
God
may
bless
thee
in
all
the
work
of
thine
hand
which
thou
doest.
015:001
At
the
end
of
every
seven
years
thou
shalt
make
a
release.
015:002
And
this
is
the
manner
of
the
release:
Every
creditor
that
lendeth
ought
unto
his
neighbour
shall
release
it;
he
shall
not
exact
it
of
his
neighbour,
or
of
his
brother;
because
it
is
called
the
LORD's
release.
015:003
Of
a
foreigner
thou
mayest
exact
it
again:
but
that
which
is
thine
with
thy
brother
thine
hand
shall
release;
015:004
Save
when
there
shall
be
no
poor
among
you;
for
the
LORD
shall
greatly
bless
thee
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
to
possess
it:
015:005
Only
if
thou
carefully
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
observe
to
do
all
these
commandments
which
I
command
thee
this
day.
015:006
For
the
LORD
thy
God
blesseth
thee,
as
he
promised
thee:
and
thou
shalt
lend
unto
many
nations,
but
thou
shalt
not
borrow;
and
thou
shalt
reign
over
many
nations,
but
they
shall
not
reign
over
thee.
015:007
If
there
be
among
you
a
poor
man
of
one
of
thy
brethren
within
any
of
thy
gates
in
thy
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
thou
shalt
not
harden
thine
heart,
nor
shut
thine
hand
from
thy
poor
brother:
015:008
But
thou
shalt
open
thine
hand
wide
unto
him,
and
shalt
surely
lend
him
sufficient
for
his
need,
in
that
which
he
wanteth.
015:009
Beware
that
there
be
not
a
thought
in
thy
wicked
heart,
saying,
The
seventh
year,
the
year
of
release,
is
at
hand;
and
thine
eye
be
evil
against
thy
poor
brother,
and
thou
givest
him
nought;
and
he
cry
unto
the
LORD
against
thee,
and
it
be
sin
unto
thee.
015:010
Thou
shalt
surely
give
him,
and
thine
heart
shall
not
be
grieved
when
thou
givest
unto
him:
because
that
for
this
thing
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
bless
thee
in
all
thy
works,
and
in
all
that
thou
puttest
thine
hand
unto.
015:011
For
the
poor
shall
never
cease
out
of
the
land:
therefore
I
command
thee,
saying,
Thou
shalt
open
thine
hand
wide
unto
thy
brother,
to
thy
poor,
and
to
thy
needy,
in
thy
land.
015:012
And
if
thy
brother,
an
Hebrew
man,
or
an
Hebrew
woman,
be
sold
unto
thee,
and
serve
thee
six
years;
then
in
the
seventh
year
thou
shalt
let
him
go
free
from
thee.
015:013
And
when
thou
sendest
him
out
free
from
thee,
thou
shalt
not
let
him
go
away
empty:
015:014
Thou
shalt
furnish
him
liberally
out
of
thy
flock,
and
out
of
thy
floor,
and
out
of
thy
winepress:
of
that
wherewith
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
blessed
thee
thou
shalt
give
unto
him.
015:015
And
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
the
LORD
thy
God
redeemed
thee:
therefore
I
command
thee
this
thing
to
day.
015:016
And
it
shall
be,
if
he
say
unto
thee,
I
will
not
go
away
from
thee;
because
he
loveth
thee
and
thine
house,
because
he
is
well
with
thee;
015:017
Then
thou
shalt
take
an
aul,
and
thrust
it
through
his
ear
unto
the
door,
and
he
shall
be
thy
servant
for
ever.
And
also
unto
thy
maidservant
thou
shalt
do
likewise.
015:018
It
shall
not
seem
hard
unto
thee,
when
thou
sendest
him
away
free
from
thee;
for
he
hath
been
worth
a
double
hired
servant
to
thee,
in
serving
thee
six
years:
and
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
bless
thee
in
all
that
thou
doest.
015:019
All
the
firstling
males
that
come
of
thy
herd
and
of
thy
flock
thou
shalt
sanctify
unto
the
LORD
thy
God:
thou
shalt
do
no
work
with
the
firstling
of
thy
bullock,
nor
shear
the
firstling
of
thy
sheep.
015:020
Thou
shalt
eat
it
before
the
LORD
thy
God
year
by
year
in
the
place
which
the
LORD
shall
choose,
thou
and
thy
household.
015:021
And
if
there
be
any
blemish
therein,
as
if
it
be
lame,
or
blind,
or
have
any
ill
blemish,
thou
shalt
not
sacrifice
it
unto
the
LORD
thy
God.
015:022
Thou
shalt
eat
it
within
thy
gates:
the
unclean
and
the
clean
person
shall
eat
it
alike,
as
the
roebuck,
and
as
the
hart.
015:023
Only
thou
shalt
not
eat
the
blood
thereof;
thou
shalt
pour
it
upon
the
ground
as
water.
016:001
Observe
the
month
of
Abib,
and
keep
the
passover
unto
the
LORD
thy
God:
for
in
the
month
of
Abib
the
LORD
thy
God
brought
thee
forth
out
of
Egypt
by
night.
016:002
Thou
shalt
therefore
sacrifice
the
passover
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
of
the
flock
and
the
herd,
in
the
place
which
the
LORD
shall
choose
to
place
his
name
there.
016:003
Thou
shalt
eat
no
leavened
bread
with
it;
seven
days
shalt
thou
eat
unleavened
bread
therewith,
even
the
bread
of
affliction;
for
thou
camest
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
in
haste:
that
thou
mayest
remember
the
day
when
thou
camest
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
all
the
days
of
thy
life.
016:004
And
there
shall
be
no
leavened
bread
seen
with
thee
in
all
thy
coast
seven
days;
neither
shall
there
any
thing
of
the
flesh,
which
thou
sacrificedst
the
first
day
at
even,
remain
all
night
until
the
morning.
016:005
Thou
mayest
not
sacrifice
the
passover
within
any
of
thy
gates,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee:
016:006
But
at
the
place
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
choose
to
place
his
name
in,
there
thou
shalt
sacrifice
the
passover
at
even,
at
the
going
down
of
the
sun,
at
the
season
that
thou
camest
forth
out
of
Egypt.
016:007
And
thou
shalt
roast
and
eat
it
in
the
place
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
choose:
and
thou
shalt
turn
in
the
morning,
and
go
unto
thy
tents.
016:008
Six
days
thou
shalt
eat
unleavened
bread:
and
on
the
seventh
day
shall
be
a
solemn
assembly
to
the
LORD
thy
God:
thou
shalt
do
no
work
therein.
016:009
Seven
weeks
shalt
thou
number
unto
thee:
begin
to
number
the
seven
weeks
from
such
time
as
thou
beginnest
to
put
the
sickle
to
the
corn.
016:010
And
thou
shalt
keep
the
feast
of
weeks
unto
the
LORD
thy
God
with
a
tribute
of
a
freewill
offering
of
thine
hand,
which
thou
shalt
give
