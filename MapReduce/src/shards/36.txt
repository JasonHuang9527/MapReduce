unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
according
as
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
blessed
thee:
016:011
And
thou
shalt
rejoice
before
the
LORD
thy
God,
thou,
and
thy
son,
and
thy
daughter,
and
thy
manservant,
and
thy
maidservant,
and
the
Levite
that
is
within
thy
gates,
and
the
stranger,
and
the
fatherless,
and
the
widow,
that
are
among
you,
in
the
place
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
chosen
to
place
his
name
there.
016:012
And
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
Egypt:
and
thou
shalt
observe
and
do
these
statutes.
016:013
Thou
shalt
observe
the
feast
of
tabernacles
seven
days,
after
that
thou
hast
gathered
in
thy
corn
and
thy
wine:
016:014
And
thou
shalt
rejoice
in
thy
feast,
thou,
and
thy
son,
and
thy
daughter,
and
thy
manservant,
and
thy
maidservant,
and
the
Levite,
the
stranger,
and
the
fatherless,
and
the
widow,
that
are
within
thy
gates.
016:015
Seven
days
shalt
thou
keep
a
solemn
feast
unto
the
LORD
thy
God
in
the
place
which
the
LORD
shall
choose:
because
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
bless
thee
in
all
thine
increase,
and
in
all
the
works
of
thine
hands,
therefore
thou
shalt
surely
rejoice.
016:016
Three
times
in
a
year
shall
all
thy
males
appear
before
the
LORD
thy
God
in
the
place
which
he
shall
choose;
in
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread,
and
in
the
feast
of
weeks,
and
in
the
feast
of
tabernacles:
and
they
shall
not
appear
before
the
LORD
empty:
016:017
Every
man
shall
give
as
he
is
able,
according
to
the
blessing
of
the
LORD
thy
God
which
he
hath
given
thee.
016:018
Judges
and
officers
shalt
thou
make
thee
in
all
thy
gates,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
throughout
thy
tribes:
and
they
shall
judge
the
people
with
just
judgment.
016:019
Thou
shalt
not
wrest
judgment;
thou
shalt
not
respect
persons,
neither
take
a
gift:
for
a
gift
doth
blind
the
eyes
of
the
wise,
and
pervert
the
words
of
the
righteous.
016:020
That
which
is
altogether
just
shalt
thou
follow,
that
thou
mayest
live,
and
inherit
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee.
016:021
Thou
shalt
not
plant
thee
a
grove
of
any
trees
near
unto
the
altar
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
thou
shalt
make
thee.
016:022
Neither
shalt
thou
set
thee
up
any
image;
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hateth.
017:001
Thou
shalt
not
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
thy
God
any
bullock,
or
sheep,
wherein
is
blemish,
or
any
evilfavouredness:
for
that
is
an
abomination
unto
the
LORD
thy
God.
017:002
If
there
be
found
among
you,
within
any
of
thy
gates
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
man
or
woman,
that
hath
wrought
wickedness
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
in
transgressing
his
covenant,
017:003
And
hath
gone
and
served
other
gods,
and
worshipped
them,
either
the
sun,
or
moon,
or
any
of
the
host
of
heaven,
which
I
have
not
commanded;
017:004
And
it
be
told
thee,
and
thou
hast
heard
of
it,
and
enquired
diligently,
and,
behold,
it
be
true,
and
the
thing
certain,
that
such
abomination
is
wrought
in
Israel:
017:005
Then
shalt
thou
bring
forth
that
man
or
that
woman,
which
have
committed
that
wicked
thing,
unto
thy
gates,
even
that
man
or
that
woman,
and
shalt
stone
them
with
stones,
till
they
die.
017:006
At
the
mouth
of
two
witnesses,
or
three
witnesses,
shall
he
that
is
worthy
of
death
be
put
to
death;
but
at
the
mouth
of
one
witness
he
shall
not
be
put
to
death.
017:007
The
hands
of
the
witnesses
shall
be
first
upon
him
to
put
him
to
death,
and
afterward
the
hands
of
all
the
people.
So
thou
shalt
put
the
evil
away
from
among
you.
017:008
If
there
arise
a
matter
too
hard
for
thee
in
judgment,
between
blood
and
blood,
between
plea
and
plea,
and
between
stroke
and
stroke,
being
matters
of
controversy
within
thy
gates:
then
shalt
thou
arise,
and
get
thee
up
into
the
place
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
choose;
017:009
And
thou
shalt
come
unto
the
priests
the
Levites,
and
unto
the
judge
that
shall
be
in
those
days,
and
enquire;
and
they
shall
shew
thee
the
sentence
of
judgment:
017:010
And
thou
shalt
do
according
to
the
sentence,
which
they
of
that
place
which
the
LORD
shall
choose
shall
shew
thee;
and
thou
shalt
observe
to
do
according
to
all
that
they
inform
thee:
017:011
According
to
the
sentence
of
the
law
which
they
shall
teach
thee,
and
according
to
the
judgment
which
they
shall
tell
thee,
thou
shalt
do:
thou
shalt
not
decline
from
the
sentence
which
they
shall
shew
thee,
to
the
right
hand,
nor
to
the
left.
017:012
And
the
man
that
will
do
presumptuously,
and
will
not
hearken
unto
the
priest
that
standeth
to
minister
there
before
the
LORD
thy
God,
or
unto
the
judge,
even
that
man
shall
die:
and
thou
shalt
put
away
the
evil
from
Israel.
017:013
And
all
the
people
shall
hear,
and
fear,
and
do
no
more
presumptuously.
017:014
When
thou
art
come
unto
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
and
shalt
possess
it,
and
shalt
dwell
therein,
and
shalt
say,
I
will
set
a
king
over
me,
like
as
all
the
nations
that
are
about
me;
017:015
Thou
shalt
in
any
wise
set
him
king
over
thee,
whom
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
choose:
one
from
among
thy
brethren
shalt
thou
set
king
over
thee:
thou
mayest
not
set
a
stranger
over
thee,
which
is
not
thy
brother.
017:016
But
he
shall
not
multiply
horses
to
himself,
nor
cause
the
people
to
return
to
Egypt,
to
the
end
that
he
should
multiply
horses:
forasmuch
as
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
you,
Ye
shall
henceforth
return
no
more
that
way.
017:017
Neither
shall
he
multiply
wives
to
himself,
that
his
heart
turn
not
away:
neither
shall
he
greatly
multiply
to
himself
silver
and
gold.
017:018
And
it
shall
be,
when
he
sitteth
upon
the
throne
of
his
kingdom,
that
he
shall
write
him
a
copy
of
this
law
in
a
book
out
of
that
which
is
before
the
priests
the
Levites:
017:019
And
it
shall
be
with
him,
and
he
shall
read
therein
all
the
days
of
his
life:
that
he
may
learn
to
fear
the
LORD
his
God,
to
keep
all
the
words
of
this
law
and
these
statutes,
to
do
them:
017:020
That
his
heart
be
not
lifted
up
above
his
brethren,
and
that
he
turn
not
aside
from
the
commandment,
to
the
right
hand,
or
to
the
left:
to
the
end
that
he
may
prolong
his
days
in
his
kingdom,
he,
and
his
children,
in
the
midst
of
Israel.
018:001
The
priests
the
Levites,
and
all
the
tribe
of
Levi,
shall
have
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
Israel:
they
shall
eat
the
offerings
of
the
LORD
made
by
fire,
and
his
inheritance.
018:002
Therefore
shall
they
have
no
inheritance
among
their
brethren:
the
LORD
is
their
inheritance,
as
he
hath
said
unto
them.
018:003
And
this
shall
be
the
priest's
due
from
the
people,
from
them
that
offer
a
sacrifice,
whether
it
be
ox
or
sheep;
and
they
shall
give
unto
the
priest
the
shoulder,
and
the
two
cheeks,
and
the
maw.
018:004
The
firstfruit
also
of
thy
corn,
of
thy
wine,
and
of
thine
oil,
and
the
first
of
the
fleece
of
thy
sheep,
shalt
thou
give
him.
018:005
For
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
chosen
him
out
of
all
thy
tribes,
to
stand
to
minister
in
the
name
of
the
LORD,
him
and
his
sons
for
ever.
018:006
And
if
a
Levite
come
from
any
of
thy
gates
out
of
all
Israel,
where
he
sojourned,
and
come
with
all
the
desire
of
his
mind
unto
the
place
which
the
LORD
shall
choose;
018:007
Then
he
shall
minister
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
his
God,
as
all
his
brethren
the
Levites
do,
which
stand
there
before
the
LORD.
018:008
They
shall
have
like
portions
to
eat,
beside
that
which
cometh
of
the
sale
of
his
patrimony.
018:009
When
thou
art
come
into
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
thou
shalt
not
learn
to
do
after
the
abominations
of
those
nations.
018:010
There
shall
not
be
found
among
you
any
one
that
maketh
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire,
or
that
useth
divination,
or
an
observer
of
times,
or
an
enchanter,
or
a
witch.
018:011
Or
a
charmer,
or
a
consulter
with
familiar
spirits,
or
a
wizard,
or
a
necromancer.
018:012
For
all
that
do
these
things
are
an
abomination
unto
the
LORD:
and
because
of
these
abominations
the
LORD
thy
God
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee.
018:013
Thou
shalt
be
perfect
with
the
LORD
thy
God.
018:014
For
these
nations,
which
thou
shalt
possess,
hearkened
unto
observers
of
times,
and
unto
diviners:
but
as
for
thee,
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
not
suffered
thee
so
to
do.
018:015
The
LORD
thy
God
will
raise
up
unto
thee
a
Prophet
from
the
midst
of
thee,
of
thy
brethren,
like
unto
me;
unto
him
ye
shall
hearken;
018:016
According
to
all
that
thou
desiredst
of
the
LORD
thy
God
in
Horeb
in
the
day
of
the
assembly,
saying,
Let
me
not
hear
again
the
voice
of
the
LORD
my
God,
neither
let
me
see
this
great
fire
any
more,
that
I
die
not.
018:017
And
the
LORD
said
unto
me,
They
have
well
spoken
that
which
they
have
spoken.
018:018
I
will
raise
them
up
a
Prophet
from
among
their
brethren,
like
unto
thee,
and
will
put
my
words
in
his
mouth;
and
he
shall
speak
unto
them
all
that
I
shall
command
him.
018:019
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
whosoever
will
not
hearken
unto
my
words
which
he
shall
speak
in
my
name,
I
will
require
it
of
him.
018:020
But
the
prophet,
which
shall
presume
to
speak
a
word
in
my
name,
which
I
have
not
commanded
him
to
speak,
or
that
shall
speak
in
the
name
of
other
gods,
even
that
prophet
shall
die.
018:021
And
if
thou
say
in
thine
heart,
How
shall
we
know
the
word
which
the
LORD
hath
not
spoken?
018:022
When
a
prophet
speaketh
in
the
name
of
the
LORD,
if
the
thing
follow
not,
nor
come
to
pass,
that
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
hath
not
spoken,
but
the
prophet
hath
spoken
it
presumptuously:
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
him.
019:001
When
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
cut
off
the
nations,
whose
land
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
and
thou
succeedest
them,
and
dwellest
in
their
cities,
and
in
their
houses;
019:002
Thou
shalt
separate
three
cities
for
thee
in
the
midst
of
thy
land,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
to
possess
it.
019:003
Thou
shalt
prepare
thee
a
way,
and
divide
the
coasts
of
thy
land,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
to
inherit,
into
three
parts,
that
every
slayer
may
flee
thither.
019:004
And
this
is
the
case
of
the
slayer,
which
shall
flee
thither,
that
he
may
live:
Whoso
killeth
his
neighbour
ignorantly,
whom
he
hated
not
in
time
past;
019:005
As
when
a
man
goeth
into
the
wood
with
his
neighbour
to
hew
wood,
and
his
hand
fetcheth
a
stroke
with
the
axe
to
cut
down
the
tree,
and
the
head
slippeth
from
the
helve,
and
lighteth
upon
his
neighbour,
that
he
die;
he
shall
flee
unto
one
of
those
cities,
and
live:
019:006
Lest
the
avenger
of
the
blood
pursue
the
slayer,
while
his
heart
is
hot,
and
overtake
him,
because
the
way
is
long,
and
slay
him;
whereas
he
was
not
worthy
of
death,
inasmuch
as
he
hated
him
not
in
time
past.
019:007
Wherefore
I
command
thee,
saying,
Thou
shalt
separate
three
cities
for
thee.
019:008
And
if
the
LORD
thy
God
enlarge
thy
coast,
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thy
fathers,
and
give
thee
all
the
land
which
he
promised
to
give
unto
thy
fathers;
019:009
If
thou
shalt
keep
all
these
commandments
to
do
them,
which
I
command
thee
this
day,
to
love
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
to
walk
ever
in
his
ways;
then
shalt
thou
add
three
cities
more
for
thee,
beside
these
three:
019:010
That
innocent
blood
be
not
shed
in
thy
land,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance,
and
so
blood
be
upon
thee.
019:011
But
if
any
man
hate
his
neighbour,
and
lie
in
wait
for
him,
and
rise
up
against
him,
and
smite
him
mortally
that
he
die,
and
fleeth
into
one
of
these
cities:
019:012
Then
the
elders
of
his
city
shall
send
and
fetch
him
thence,
and
deliver
him
into
the
hand
of
the
avenger
of
blood,
that
he
may
die.
019:013
Thine
eye
shall
not
pity
him,
but
thou
shalt
put
away
the
guilt
of
innocent
blood
from
Israel,
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee.
019:014
Thou
shalt
not
remove
thy
neighbour's
landmark,
which
they
of
old
time
have
set
in
thine
inheritance,
which
thou
shalt
inherit
in
the
land
that
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
to
possess
it.
019:015
One
witness
shall
not
rise
up
against
a
man
for
any
iniquity,
or
for
any
sin,
in
any
sin
that
he
sinneth:
at
the
mouth
of
two
witnesses,
or
at
the
mouth
of
three
witnesses,
shall
the
matter
be
established.
019:016
If
a
false
witness
rise
up
against
any
man
to
testify
against
him
that
which
is
wrong;
019:017
Then
both
the
men,
between
whom
the
controversy
is,
shall
stand
before
the
LORD,
before
the
priests
and
the
judges,
which
shall
be
in
those
days;
019:018
And
the
judges
shall
make
diligent
inquisition:
and,
behold,
if
the
witness
be
a
false
witness,
and
hath
testified
falsely
against
his
brother;
019:019
Then
shall
ye
do
unto
him,
as
he
had
thought
to
have
done
unto
his
brother:
so
shalt
thou
put
the
evil
away
from
among
you.
019:020
And
those
which
remain
shall
hear,
and
fear,
and
shall
henceforth
commit
no
more
any
such
evil
among
you.
019:021
And
thine
eye
shall
not
pity;
but
life
shall
go
for
life,
eye
for
eye,
tooth
for
tooth,
hand
for
hand,
foot
for
foot.
020:001
When
thou
goest
out
to
battle
against
thine
enemies,
and
seest
horses,
and
chariots,
and
a
people
more
than
thou,
be
not
afraid
of
them:
for
the
LORD
thy
God
is
with
thee,
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
020:002
And
it
shall
be,
when
ye
are
come
nigh
unto
the
battle,
that
the
priest
shall
approach
and
speak
unto
the
people,
020:003
And
shall
say
unto
them,
Hear,
O
Israel,
ye
approach
this
day
unto
battle
against
your
enemies:
let
not
your
hearts
faint,
fear
not,
and
do
not
tremble,
neither
be
ye
terrified
because
of
them;
020:004
For
the
LORD
your
God
is
he
that
goeth
with
you,
to
fight
for
you
against
your
enemies,
to
save
you.
020:005
And
the
officers
shall
speak
unto
the
people,
saying,
What
man
is
there
that
hath
built
a
new
house,
and
hath
not
dedicated
it?
let
him
go
and
return
to
his
house,
lest
he
die
in
the
battle,
and
another
man
dedicate
it.
020:006
And
what
man
is
he
that
hath
planted
a
vineyard,
and
hath
not
yet
eaten
of
it?
let
him
also
go
and
return
unto
his
house,
lest
he
die
in
the
battle,
and
another
man
eat
of
it.
020:007
And
what
man
is
there
that
hath
betrothed
a
wife,
and
hath
not
taken
her?
let
him
go
and
return
unto
his
house,
lest
he
die
in
the
battle,
and
another
man
take
her.
020:008
And
the
officers
shall
speak
further
unto
the
people,
and
they
shall
say,
What
man
is
there
that
is
fearful
and
fainthearted?
let
him
go
and
return
unto
his
house,
lest
his
brethren's
heart
faint
as
well
as
his
heart.
020:009
And
it
shall
be,
when
the
officers
have
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
the
people
that
they
shall
make
captains
of
the
armies
to
lead
the
people.
020:010
When
thou
comest
nigh
unto
a
city
to
fight
against
it,
then
proclaim
peace
unto
it.
020:011
And
it
shall
be,
if
it
make
thee
answer
of
peace,
and
open
unto
thee,
then
it
shall
be,
that
all
the
people
that
is
found
therein
shall
be
tributaries
unto
thee,
and
they
shall
serve
thee.
020:012
And
if
it
will
make
no
peace
with
thee,
but
will
make
war
against
thee,
then
thou
shalt
besiege
it:
020:013
And
when
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
delivered
it
into
thine
hands,
thou
shalt
smite
every
male
thereof
with
the
edge
of
the
sword:
020:014
But
the
women,
and
the
little
ones,
and
the
cattle,
and
all
that
is
in
the
city,
even
all
the
spoil
thereof,
shalt
thou
take
unto
thyself;
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
spoil
of
thine
enemies,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
given
thee.
020:015
Thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
all
the
cities
which
are
very
far
off
from
thee,
which
are
not
of
the
cities
of
these
nations.
020:016
But
of
the
cities
of
these
people,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
doth
give
thee
for
an
inheritance,
thou
shalt
save
alive
nothing
that
breatheth:
020:017
But
thou
shalt
utterly
destroy
them;
namely,
the
Hittites,
and
the
Amorites,
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Perizzites,
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites;
as
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
commanded
thee:
020:018
That
they
teach
you
not
to
do
after
all
their
abominations,
which
they
have
done
unto
their
gods;
so
should
ye
sin
against
the
LORD
your
God.
020:019
When
thou
shalt
besiege
a
city
a
long
time,
in
making
war
against
it
to
take
it,
thou
shalt
not
destroy
the
trees
thereof
by
forcing
an
axe
against
them:
for
thou
mayest
eat
of
them,
and
thou
shalt
not
cut
them
down
(for
the
tree
of
the
field
is
man's
life)
to
employ
them
in
the
siege:
020:020
Only
the
trees
which
thou
knowest
that
they
be
not
trees
for
meat,
thou
shalt
destroy
and
cut
them
down;
and
thou
shalt
build
bulwarks
against
the
city
that
maketh
war
with
thee,
until
it
be
subdued.
021:001
If
one
be
found
slain
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
to
possess
it,
lying
in
the
field,
and
it
be
not
known
who
hath
slain
him:
021:002
Then
thy
elders
and
thy
judges
shall
come
forth,
and
they
shall
measure
unto
the
cities
which
are
round
about
him
that
is
slain:
021:003
And
it
shall
be,
that
the
city
which
is
next
unto
the
slain
man,
even
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
take
an
heifer,
which
hath
not
been
wrought
with,
and
which
hath
not
drawn
in
the
yoke;
021:004
And
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
bring
down
the
heifer
unto
a
rough
valley,
which
is
neither
eared
nor
sown,
and
shall
strike
off
the
heifer's
neck
there
in
the
valley:
021:005
And
the
priests
the
sons
of
Levi
shall
come
near;
for
them
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
chosen
to
minister
unto
him,
and
to
bless
in
the
name
of
the
LORD;
and
by
their
word
shall
every
controversy
and
every
stroke
be
tried:
021:006
And
all
the
elders
of
that
city,
that
are
next
unto
the
slain
man,
shall
wash
their
hands
over
the
heifer
that
is
beheaded
in
the
valley:
021:007
And
they
shall
answer
and
say,
Our
hands
have
not
shed
this
blood,
neither
have
our
eyes
seen
it.
021:008
Be
merciful,
O
LORD,
unto
thy
people
Israel,
whom
thou
hast
redeemed,
and
lay
not
innocent
blood
unto
thy
people
of
Israel's
charge.
And
the
blood
shall
be
forgiven
them.
021:009
So
shalt
thou
put
away
the
guilt
of
innocent
blood
from
among
you,
when
thou
shalt
do
that
which
is
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD.
021:010
When
thou
goest
forth
to
war
against
thine
enemies,
and
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
delivered
them
into
thine
hands,
and
thou
hast
taken
them
captive,
021:011
And
seest
among
the
captives
a
beautiful
woman,
and
hast
a
desire
unto
her,
that
thou
wouldest
have
her
to
thy
wife;
021:012
Then
thou
shalt
bring
her
home
to
thine
house,
and
she
shall
shave
her
head,
and
pare
her
nails;
021:013
And
she
shall
put
the
raiment
of
her
captivity
from
off
her,
and
shall
remain
in
thine
house,
and
bewail
her
father
and
her
mother
a
full
month:
and
after
that
thou
shalt
go
in
unto
her,
and
be
her
husband,
and
she
shall
be
thy
wife.
021:014
And
it
shall
be,
if
thou
have
no
delight
in
her,
then
thou
shalt
let
her
go
whither
she
will;
but
thou
shalt
not
sell
her
at
all
for
money,
thou
shalt
not
make
merchandise
of
her,
because
thou
hast
humbled
her.
021:015
If
a
man
have
two
wives,
one
beloved,
and
another
hated,
and
they
have
born
him
children,
both
the
beloved
and
the
hated;
and
if
the
firstborn
son
be
hers
that
was
hated:
021:016
Then
it
shall
be,
when
he
maketh
his
sons
to
inherit
that
which
he
hath,
that
he
may
not
make
the
son
of
the
beloved
firstborn
before
the
son
of
the
hated,
which
is
indeed
the
firstborn:
021:017
But
he
shall
acknowledge
the
son
of
the
hated
for
the
firstborn,
by
giving
him
a
double
portion
of
all
that
he
hath:
for
he
is
the
beginning
of
his
strength;
the
right
of
the
firstborn
is
his.
021:018
If
a
man
have
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
son,
which
will
not
obey
the
voice
of
his
father,
or
the
voice
of
his
mother,
and
that,
when
they
have
chastened
him,
will
not
hearken
unto
them:
021:019
Then
shall
his
father
and
his
mother
lay
hold
on
him,
and
bring
him
out
unto
the
elders
of
his
city,
and
unto
the
gate
of
his
place;
021:020
And
they
shall
say
unto
the
elders
of
his
city,
This
our
son
is
stubborn
and
rebellious,
he
will
not
obey
our
voice;
he
is
a
glutton,
and
a
drunkard.
021:021
And
all
the
men
of
his
city
shall
stone
him
with
stones,
that
he
die:
so
shalt
thou
put
evil
away
from
among
you;
and
all
Israel
shall
hear,
and
fear.
021:022
And
if
a
man
have
committed
a
sin
worthy
of
death,
and
he
be
to
be
put
to
death,
and
thou
hang
him
on
a
tree:
021:023
His
body
shall
not
remain
all
night
upon
the
tree,
but
thou
shalt
in
any
wise
bury
him
that
day;
(for
he
that
is
hanged
is
accursed
of
God;)
that
thy
land
be
not
defiled,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance.
022:001
Thou
shalt
not
see
thy
brother's
ox
or
his
sheep
go
astray,
and
hide
thyself
from
them:
thou
shalt
in
any
case
bring
them
again
unto
thy
brother.
022:002
And
if
thy
brother
be
not
nigh
unto
thee,
or
if
thou
know
him
not,
then
thou
shalt
bring
it
unto
thine
own
house,
and
it
shall
be
with
thee
until
thy
brother
seek
after
it,
and
thou
shalt
restore
it
to
him
again.
022:003
In
like
manner
shalt
thou
do
with
his
ass;
and
so
shalt
thou
do
with
his
raiment;
and
with
all
lost
thing
of
thy
brother's,
which
he
hath
lost,
and
thou
hast
found,
shalt
thou
do
likewise:
thou
mayest
not
hide
thyself.
022:004
Thou
shalt
not
see
thy
brother's
ass
or
his
ox
fall
down
by
the
way,
and
hide
thyself
from
them:
thou
shalt
surely
help
him
to
lift
them
up
again.
022:005
The
woman
shall
not
wear
that
which
pertaineth
unto
a
man,
neither
shall
a
man
put
on
a
woman's
garment:
for
all
that
do
so
are
abomination
unto
the
LORD
thy
God.
022:006
If
a
bird's
nest
chance
to
be
before
thee
in
the
way
in
any
tree,
or
on
the
ground,
whether
they
be
young
ones,
or
eggs,
and
the
dam
sitting
upon
the
young,
or
upon
the
eggs,
thou
shalt
not
take
the
dam
with
the
young:
022:007
But
thou
shalt
in
any
wise
let
the
dam
go,
and
take
the
young
to
thee;
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee,
and
that
thou
mayest
prolong
thy
days.
022:008
When
thou
buildest
a
new
house,
then
thou
shalt
make
a
battlement
for
thy
roof,
that
thou
bring
not
blood
upon
thine
house,
if
any
man
fall
from
thence.
