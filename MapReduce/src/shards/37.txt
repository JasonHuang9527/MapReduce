022:009
Thou
shalt
not
sow
thy
vineyard
with
divers
seeds:
lest
the
fruit
of
thy
seed
which
thou
hast
sown,
and
the
fruit
of
thy
vineyard,
be
defiled.
022:010
Thou
shalt
not
plow
with
an
ox
and
an
ass
together.
022:011
Thou
shalt
not
wear
a
garment
of
divers
sorts,
as
of
woollen
and
linen
together.
022:012
Thou
shalt
make
thee
fringes
upon
the
four
quarters
of
thy
vesture,
wherewith
thou
coverest
thyself.
022:013
If
any
man
take
a
wife,
and
go
in
unto
her,
and
hate
her,
022:014
And
give
occasions
of
speech
against
her,
and
bring
up
an
evil
name
upon
her,
and
say,
I
took
this
woman,
and
when
I
came
to
her,
I
found
her
not
a
maid:
022:015
Then
shall
the
father
of
the
damsel,
and
her
mother,
take
and
bring
forth
the
tokens
of
the
damsel's
virginity
unto
the
elders
of
the
city
in
the
gate:
022:016
And
the
damsel's
father
shall
say
unto
the
elders,
I
gave
my
daughter
unto
this
man
to
wife,
and
he
hateth
her;
022:017
And,
lo,
he
hath
given
occasions
of
speech
against
her,
saying,
I
found
not
thy
daughter
a
maid;
and
yet
these
are
the
tokens
of
my
daughter's
virginity.
And
they
shall
spread
the
cloth
before
the
elders
of
the
city.
022:018
And
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
take
that
man
and
chastise
him;
022:019
And
they
shall
amerce
him
in
an
hundred
shekels
of
silver,
and
give
them
unto
the
father
of
the
damsel,
because
he
hath
brought
up
an
evil
name
upon
a
virgin
of
Israel:
and
she
shall
be
his
wife;
he
may
not
put
her
away
all
his
days.
022:020
But
if
this
thing
be
true,
and
the
tokens
of
virginity
be
not
found
for
the
damsel:
022:021
Then
they
shall
bring
out
the
damsel
to
the
door
of
her
father's
house,
and
the
men
of
her
city
shall
stone
her
with
stones
that
she
die:
because
she
hath
wrought
folly
in
Israel,
to
play
the
whore
in
her
father's
house:
so
shalt
thou
put
evil
away
from
among
you.
022:022
If
a
man
be
found
lying
with
a
woman
married
to
an
husband,
then
they
shall
both
of
them
die,
both
the
man
that
lay
with
the
woman,
and
the
woman:
so
shalt
thou
put
away
evil
from
Israel.
022:023
If
a
damsel
that
is
a
virgin
be
betrothed
unto
an
husband,
and
a
man
find
her
in
the
city,
and
lie
with
her;
022:024
Then
ye
shall
bring
them
both
out
unto
the
gate
of
that
city,
and
ye
shall
stone
them
with
stones
that
they
die;
the
damsel,
because
she
cried
not,
being
in
the
city;
and
the
man,
because
he
hath
humbled
his
neighbour's
wife:
so
thou
shalt
put
away
evil
from
among
you.
022:025
But
if
a
man
find
a
betrothed
damsel
in
the
field,
and
the
man
force
her,
and
lie
with
her:
then
the
man
only
that
lay
with
her
shall
die.
022:026
But
unto
the
damsel
thou
shalt
do
nothing;
there
is
in
the
damsel
no
sin
worthy
of
death:
for
as
when
a
man
riseth
against
his
neighbour,
and
slayeth
him,
even
so
is
this
matter:
022:027
For
he
found
her
in
the
field,
and
the
betrothed
damsel
cried,
and
there
was
none
to
save
her.
022:028
If
a
man
find
a
damsel
that
is
a
virgin,
which
is
not
betrothed,
and
lay
hold
on
her,
and
lie
with
her,
and
they
be
found;
022:029
Then
the
man
that
lay
with
her
shall
give
unto
the
damsel's
father
fifty
shekels
of
silver,
and
she
shall
be
his
wife;
because
he
hath
humbled
her,
he
may
not
put
her
away
all
his
days.
022:030
A
man
shall
not
take
his
father's
wife,
nor
discover
his
father's
skirt.
023:001
He
that
is
wounded
in
the
stones,
or
hath
his
privy
member
cut
off,
shall
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
LORD.
023:002
A
bastard
shall
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
LORD;
even
to
his
tenth
generation
shall
he
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
LORD.
023:003
An
Ammonite
or
Moabite
shall
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
LORD;
even
to
their
tenth
generation
shall
they
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
LORD
for
ever:
023:004
Because
they
met
you
not
with
bread
and
with
water
in
the
way,
when
ye
came
forth
out
of
Egypt;
and
because
they
hired
against
thee
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
of
Pethor
of
Mesopotamia,
to
curse
thee.
023:005
Nevertheless
the
LORD
thy
God
would
not
hearken
unto
Balaam;
but
the
LORD
thy
God
turned
the
curse
into
a
blessing
unto
thee,
because
the
LORD
thy
God
loved
thee.
023:006
Thou
shalt
not
seek
their
peace
nor
their
prosperity
all
thy
days
for
ever.
023:007
Thou
shalt
not
abhor
an
Edomite;
for
he
is
thy
brother:
thou
shalt
not
abhor
an
Egyptian;
because
thou
wast
a
stranger
in
his
land.
023:008
The
children
that
are
begotten
of
them
shall
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
LORD
in
their
third
generation.
023:009
When
the
host
goeth
forth
against
thine
enemies,
then
keep
thee
from
every
wicked
thing.
023:010
If
there
be
among
you
any
man,
that
is
not
clean
by
reason
of
uncleanness
that
chanceth
him
by
night,
then
shall
he
go
abroad
out
of
the
camp,
he
shall
not
come
within
the
camp:
023:011
But
it
shall
be,
when
evening
cometh
on,
he
shall
wash
himself
with
water:
and
when
the
sun
is
down,
he
shall
come
into
the
camp
again.
023:012
Thou
shalt
have
a
place
also
without
the
camp,
whither
thou
shalt
go
forth
abroad:
023:013
And
thou
shalt
have
a
paddle
upon
thy
weapon;
and
it
shall
be,
when
thou
wilt
ease
thyself
abroad,
thou
shalt
dig
therewith,
and
shalt
turn
back
and
cover
that
which
cometh
from
thee:
023:014
For
the
LORD
thy
God
walketh
in
the
midst
of
thy
camp,
to
deliver
thee,
and
to
give
up
thine
enemies
before
thee;
therefore
shall
thy
camp
be
holy:
that
he
see
no
unclean
thing
in
thee,
and
turn
away
from
thee.
023:015
Thou
shalt
not
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
which
is
escaped
from
his
master
unto
thee:
023:016
He
shall
dwell
with
thee,
even
among
you,
in
that
place
which
he
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
gates,
where
it
liketh
him
best:
thou
shalt
not
oppress
him.
023:017
There
shall
be
no
whore
of
the
daughters
of
Israel,
nor
a
sodomite
of
the
sons
of
Israel.
023:018
Thou
shalt
not
bring
the
hire
of
a
whore,
or
the
price
of
a
dog,
into
the
house
of
the
LORD
thy
God
for
any
vow:
for
even
both
these
are
abomination
unto
the
LORD
thy
God.
023:019
Thou
shalt
not
lend
upon
usury
to
thy
brother;
usury
of
money,
usury
of
victuals,
usury
of
any
thing
that
is
lent
upon
usury:
023:020
Unto
a
stranger
thou
mayest
lend
upon
usury;
but
unto
thy
brother
thou
shalt
not
lend
upon
usury:
that
the
LORD
thy
God
may
bless
thee
in
all
that
thou
settest
thine
hand
to
in
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it.
023:021
When
thou
shalt
vow
a
vow
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
thou
shalt
not
slack
to
pay
it:
for
the
LORD
thy
God
will
surely
require
it
of
thee;
and
it
would
be
sin
in
thee.
023:022
But
if
thou
shalt
forbear
to
vow,
it
shall
be
no
sin
in
thee.
023:023
That
which
is
gone
out
of
thy
lips
thou
shalt
keep
and
perform;
even
a
freewill
offering,
according
as
thou
hast
vowed
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
thou
hast
promised
with
thy
mouth.
023:024
When
thou
comest
into
thy
neighbour's
vineyard,
then
thou
mayest
eat
grapes
thy
fill
at
thine
own
pleasure;
but
thou
shalt
not
put
any
in
thy
vessel.
023:025
When
thou
comest
into
the
standing
corn
of
thy
neighbour,
then
thou
mayest
pluck
the
ears
with
thine
hand;
but
thou
shalt
not
move
a
sickle
unto
thy
neighbour's
standing
corn.
024:001
When
a
man
hath
taken
a
wife,
and
married
her,
and
it
come
to
pass
that
she
find
no
favour
in
his
eyes,
because
he
hath
found
some
uncleanness
in
her:
then
let
him
write
her
a
bill
of
divorcement,
and
give
it
in
her
hand,
and
send
her
out
of
his
house.
024:002
And
when
she
is
departed
out
of
his
house,
she
may
go
and
be
another
man's
wife.
024:003
And
if
the
latter
husband
hate
her,
and
write
her
a
bill
of
divorcement,
and
giveth
it
in
her
hand,
and
sendeth
her
out
of
his
house;
or
if
the
latter
husband
die,
which
took
her
to
be
his
wife;
024:004
Her
former
husband,
which
sent
her
away,
may
not
take
her
again
to
be
his
wife,
after
that
she
is
defiled;
for
that
is
abomination
before
the
LORD:
and
thou
shalt
not
cause
the
land
to
sin,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance.
024:005
When
a
man
hath
taken
a
new
wife,
he
shall
not
go
out
to
war,
neither
shall
he
be
charged
with
any
business:
but
he
shall
be
free
at
home
one
year,
and
shall
cheer
up
his
wife
which
he
hath
taken.
024:006
No
man
shall
take
the
nether
or
the
upper
millstone
to
pledge:
for
he
taketh
a
man's
life
to
pledge.
024:007
If
a
man
be
found
stealing
any
of
his
brethren
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
maketh
merchandise
of
him,
or
selleth
him;
then
that
thief
shall
die;
and
thou
shalt
put
evil
away
from
among
you.
024:008
Take
heed
in
the
plague
of
leprosy,
that
thou
observe
diligently,
and
do
according
to
all
that
the
priests
the
Levites
shall
teach
you:
as
I
commanded
them,
so
ye
shall
observe
to
do.
024:009
Remember
what
the
LORD
thy
God
did
unto
Miriam
by
the
way,
after
that
ye
were
come
forth
out
of
Egypt.
024:010
When
thou
dost
lend
thy
brother
any
thing,
thou
shalt
not
go
into
his
house
to
fetch
his
pledge.
024:011
Thou
shalt
stand
abroad,
and
the
man
to
whom
thou
dost
lend
shall
bring
out
the
pledge
abroad
unto
thee.
024:012
And
if
the
man
be
poor,
thou
shalt
not
sleep
with
his
pledge:
024:013
In
any
case
thou
shalt
deliver
him
the
pledge
again
when
the
sun
goeth
down,
that
he
may
sleep
in
his
own
raiment,
and
bless
thee:
and
it
shall
be
righteousness
unto
thee
before
the
LORD
thy
God.
024:014
Thou
shalt
not
oppress
an
hired
servant
that
is
poor
and
needy,
whether
he
be
of
thy
brethren,
or
of
thy
strangers
that
are
in
thy
land
within
thy
gates:
024:015
At
his
day
thou
shalt
give
him
his
hire,
neither
shall
the
sun
go
down
upon
it;
for
he
is
poor,
and
setteth
his
heart
upon
it:
lest
he
cry
against
thee
unto
the
LORD,
and
it
be
sin
unto
thee.
024:016
The
fathers
shall
not
be
put
to
death
for
the
children,
neither
shall
the
children
be
put
to
death
for
the
fathers:
every
man
shall
be
put
to
death
for
his
own
sin.
024:017
Thou
shalt
not
pervert
the
judgment
of
the
stranger,
nor
of
the
fatherless;
nor
take
a
widow's
raiment
to
pledge:
024:018
But
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
Egypt,
and
the
LORD
thy
God
redeemed
thee
thence:
therefore
I
command
thee
to
do
this
thing.
024:019
When
thou
cuttest
down
thine
harvest
in
thy
field,
and
hast
forgot
a
sheaf
in
the
field,
thou
shalt
not
go
again
to
fetch
it:
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger,
for
the
fatherless,
and
for
the
widow:
that
the
LORD
thy
God
may
bless
thee
in
all
the
work
of
thine
hands.
024:020
When
thou
beatest
thine
olive
tree,
thou
shalt
not
go
over
the
boughs
again:
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger,
for
the
fatherless,
and
for
the
widow.
024:021
When
thou
gatherest
the
grapes
of
thy
vineyard,
thou
shalt
not
glean
it
afterward:
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger,
for
the
fatherless,
and
for
the
widow.
024:022
And
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
the
land
of
Egypt:
therefore
I
command
thee
to
do
this
thing.
025:001
If
there
be
a
controversy
between
men,
and
they
come
unto
judgment,
that
the
judges
may
judge
them;
then
they
shall
justify
the
righteous,
and
condemn
the
wicked.
025:002
And
it
shall
be,
if
the
wicked
man
be
worthy
to
be
beaten,
that
the
judge
shall
cause
him
to
lie
down,
and
to
be
beaten
before
his
face,
according
to
his
fault,
by
a
certain
number.
025:003
Forty
stripes
he
may
give
him,
and
not
exceed:
lest,
if
he
should
exceed,
and
beat
him
above
these
with
many
stripes,
then
thy
brother
should
seem
vile
unto
thee.
025:004
Thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
ox
when
he
treadeth
out
the
corn.
025:005
If
brethren
dwell
together,
and
one
of
them
die,
and
have
no
child,
the
wife
of
the
dead
shall
not
marry
without
unto
a
stranger:
her
husband's
brother
shall
go
in
unto
her,
and
take
her
to
him
to
wife,
and
perform
the
duty
of
an
husband's
brother
unto
her.
025:006
And
it
shall
be,
that
the
firstborn
which
she
beareth
shall
succeed
in
the
name
of
his
brother
which
is
dead,
that
his
name
be
not
put
out
of
Israel.
025:007
And
if
the
man
like
not
to
take
his
brother's
wife,
then
let
his
brother's
wife
go
up
to
the
gate
unto
the
elders,
and
say,
My
husband's
brother
refuseth
to
raise
up
unto
his
brother
a
name
in
Israel,
he
will
not
perform
the
duty
of
my
husband's
brother.
025:008
Then
the
elders
of
his
city
shall
call
him,
and
speak
unto
him:
and
if
he
stand
to
it,
and
say,
I
like
not
to
take
her;
025:009
Then
shall
his
brother's
wife
come
unto
him
in
the
presence
of
the
elders,
and
loose
his
shoe
from
off
his
foot,
and
spit
in
his
face,
and
shall
answer
and
say,
So
shall
it
be
done
unto
that
man
that
will
not
build
up
his
brother's
house.
025:010
And
his
name
shall
be
called
in
Israel,
The
house
of
him
that
hath
his
shoe
loosed.
025:011
When
men
strive
together
one
with
another,
and
the
wife
of
the
one
draweth
near
for
to
deliver
her
husband
out
of
the
hand
of
him
that
smiteth
him,
and
putteth
forth
her
hand,
and
taketh
him
by
the
secrets:
025:012
Then
thou
shalt
cut
off
her
hand,
thine
eye
shall
not
pity
her.
025:013
Thou
shalt
not
have
in
thy
bag
divers
weights,
a
great
and
a
small.
025:014
Thou
shalt
not
have
in
thine
house
divers
measures,
a
great
and
a
small.
025:015
But
thou
shalt
have
a
perfect
and
just
weight,
a
perfect
and
just
measure
shalt
thou
have:
that
thy
days
may
be
lengthened
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee.
025:016
For
all
that
do
such
things,
and
all
that
do
unrighteously,
are
an
abomination
unto
the
LORD
thy
God.
025:017
Remember
what
Amalek
did
unto
thee
by
the
way,
when
ye
were
come
forth
out
of
Egypt;
025:018
How
he
met
thee
by
the
way,
and
smote
the
hindmost
of
thee,
even
all
that
were
feeble
behind
thee,
when
thou
wast
faint
and
weary;
and
he
feared
not
God.
025:019
Therefore
it
shall
be,
when
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
given
thee
rest
from
all
thine
enemies
round
about,
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
to
possess
it,
that
thou
shalt
blot
out
the
remembrance
of
Amalek
from
under
heaven;
thou
shalt
not
forget
it.
026:001
And
it
shall
be,
when
thou
art
come
in
unto
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance,
and
possessest
it,
and
dwellest
therein;
026:002
That
thou
shalt
take
of
the
first
of
all
the
fruit
of
the
earth,
which
thou
shalt
bring
of
thy
land
that
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
and
shalt
put
it
in
a
basket,
and
shalt
go
unto
the
place
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
choose
to
place
his
name
there.
026:003
And
thou
shalt
go
unto
the
priest
that
shall
be
in
those
days,
and
say
unto
him,
I
profess
this
day
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
that
I
am
come
unto
the
country
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
our
fathers
for
to
give
us.
026:004
And
the
priest
shall
take
the
basket
out
of
thine
hand,
and
set
it
down
before
the
altar
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
026:005
And
thou
shalt
speak
and
say
before
the
LORD
thy
God,
A
Syrian
ready
to
perish
was
my
father,
and
he
went
down
into
Egypt,
and
sojourned
there
with
a
few,
and
became
there
a
nation,
great,
mighty,
and
populous:
026:006
And
the
Egyptians
evil
entreated
us,
and
afflicted
us,
and
laid
upon
us
hard
bondage:
026:007
And
when
we
cried
unto
the
LORD
God
of
our
fathers,
the
LORD
heard
our
voice,
and
looked
on
our
affliction,
and
our
labour,
and
our
oppression:
026:008
And
the
LORD
brought
us
forth
out
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
hand,
and
with
an
outstretched
arm,
and
with
great
terribleness,
and
with
signs,
and
with
wonders:
026:009
And
he
hath
brought
us
into
this
place,
and
hath
given
us
this
land,
even
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey.
026:010
And
now,
behold,
I
have
brought
the
firstfruits
of
the
land,
which
thou,
O
LORD,
hast
given
me.
And
thou
shalt
set
it
before
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
worship
before
the
LORD
thy
God:
026:011
And
thou
shalt
rejoice
in
every
good
thing
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
given
unto
thee,
and
unto
thine
house,
thou,
and
the
Levite,
and
the
stranger
that
is
among
you.
026:012
When
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
tithing
all
the
tithes
of
thine
increase
the
third
year,
which
is
the
year
of
tithing,
and
hast
given
it
unto
the
Levite,
the
stranger,
the
fatherless,
and
the
widow,
that
they
may
eat
within
thy
gates,
and
be
filled;
026:013
Then
thou
shalt
say
before
the
LORD
thy
God,
I
have
brought
away
the
hallowed
things
out
of
mine
house,
and
also
have
given
them
unto
the
Levite,
and
unto
the
stranger,
to
the
fatherless,
and
to
the
widow,
according
to
all
thy
commandments
which
thou
hast
commanded
me:
I
have
not
transgressed
thy
commandments,
neither
have
I
forgotten
them.
026:014
I
have
not
eaten
thereof
in
my
mourning,
neither
have
I
taken
away
ought
thereof
for
any
unclean
use,
nor
given
ought
thereof
for
the
dead:
but
I
have
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
the
LORD
my
God,
and
have
done
according
to
all
that
thou
hast
commanded
me.
026:015
Look
down
from
thy
holy
habitation,
from
heaven,
and
bless
thy
people
Israel,
and
the
land
which
thou
hast
given
us,
as
thou
swarest
unto
our
fathers,
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey.
026:016
This
day
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
commanded
thee
to
do
these
statutes
and
judgments:
thou
shalt
therefore
keep
and
do
them
with
all
thine
heart,
and
with
all
thy
soul.
026:017
Thou
hast
avouched
the
LORD
this
day
to
be
thy
God,
and
to
walk
in
his
ways,
and
to
keep
his
statutes,
and
his
commandments,
and
his
judgments,
and
to
hearken
unto
his
voice:
026:018
And
the
LORD
hath
avouched
thee
this
day
to
be
his
peculiar
people,
as
he
hath
promised
thee,
and
that
thou
shouldest
keep
all
his
commandments;
026:019
And
to
make
thee
high
above
all
nations
which
he
hath
made,
in
praise,
and
in
name,
and
in
honour;
and
that
thou
mayest
be
an
holy
people
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
as
he
hath
spoken.
027:001
And
Moses
with
the
elders
of
Israel
commanded
the
people,
saying,
Keep
all
the
commandments
which
I
command
you
this
day.
027:002
And
it
shall
be
on
the
day
when
ye
shall
pass
over
Jordan
unto
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
that
thou
shalt
set
thee
up
great
stones,
and
plaister
them
with
plaister:
027:003
And
thou
shalt
write
upon
them
all
the
words
of
this
law,
when
thou
art
passed
over,
that
thou
mayest
go
in
unto
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee,
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey;
as
the
LORD
God
of
thy
fathers
hath
promised
thee.
027:004
Therefore
it
shall
be
when
ye
be
gone
over
Jordan,
that
ye
shall
set
up
these
stones,
which
I
command
you
this
day,
in
mount
Ebal,
and
thou
shalt
plaister
them
with
plaister.
027:005
And
there
shalt
thou
build
an
altar
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
an
altar
of
stones:
thou
shalt
not
lift
up
any
iron
tool
upon
them.
027:006
Thou
shalt
build
the
altar
of
the
LORD
thy
God
of
whole
stones:
and
thou
shalt
offer
burnt
offerings
thereon
unto
the
LORD
thy
God:
027:007
And
thou
shalt
offer
peace
offerings,
and
shalt
eat
there,
and
rejoice
before
the
LORD
thy
God.
027:008
And
thou
shalt
write
upon
the
stones
all
the
words
of
this
law
very
plainly.
027:009
And
Moses
and
the
priests
the
Levites
spake
unto
all
Israel,
saying,
Take
heed,
and
hearken,
O
Israel;
this
day
thou
art
become
the
people
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
027:010
Thou
shalt
therefore
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
do
his
commandments
and
his
statutes,
which
I
command
thee
this
day.
027:011
And
Moses
charged
the
people
the
same
day,
saying,
027:012
These
shall
stand
upon
mount
Gerizim
to
bless
the
people,
when
ye
are
come
over
Jordan;
Simeon,
and
Levi,
and
Judah,
and
Issachar,
and
Joseph,
and
Benjamin:
027:013
And
these
shall
stand
upon
mount
Ebal
to
curse;
Reuben,
Gad,
and
Asher,
and
Zebulun,
Dan,
and
Naphtali.
027:014
And
the
Levites
shall
speak,
and
say
unto
all
the
men
of
Israel
with
a
loud
voice,
027:015
Cursed
be
the
man
that
maketh
any
graven
or
molten
image,
an
abomination
unto
the
LORD,
the
work
of
the
hands
of
the
craftsman,
and
putteth
it
in
a
secret
place.
And
all
the
people
shall
answer
and
say,
Amen.
027:016
Cursed
be
he
that
setteth
light
by
his
father
or
his
mother.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:017
Cursed
be
he
that
removeth
his
neighbour's
landmark.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:018
Cursed
be
he
that
maketh
the
blind
to
wander
out
of
the
way.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:019
Cursed
be
he
that
perverteth
the
judgment
of
the
stranger,
fatherless,
and
widow.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:020
Cursed
be
he
that
lieth
with
his
father's
wife;
because
he
uncovereth
his
father's
skirt.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:021
Cursed
be
he
that
lieth
with
any
manner
of
beast.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:022
Cursed
be
he
that
lieth
with
his
sister,
the
daughter
of
his
father,
or
the
daughter
of
his
mother.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:023
Cursed
be
he
that
lieth
with
his
mother
in
law.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:024
Cursed
be
he
that
smiteth
his
neighbour
secretly.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:025
Cursed
be
he
that
taketh
reward
to
slay
an
innocent
person.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
027:026
Cursed
be
he
that
confirmeth
not
all
the
words
of
this
law
to
do
them.
And
all
the
people
shall
say,
Amen.
028:001
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
thou
shalt
hearken
diligently
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
observe
and
to
do
all
his
commandments
which
I
command
thee
this
day,
that
the
LORD
thy
God
will
set
thee
on
high
above
all
nations
of
the
earth:
028:002
And
all
these
blessings
shall
come
on
thee,
and
overtake
thee,
if
thou
shalt
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
028:003
Blessed
shalt
thou
be
in
the
city,
and
blessed
shalt
thou
be
in
the
field.
028:004
Blessed
shall
be
the
fruit
of
thy
body,
and
the
fruit
of
thy
ground,
and
the
fruit
of
thy
cattle,
the
increase
of
thy
kine,
and
the
flocks
of
thy
sheep.
028:005
Blessed
shall
be
thy
basket
and
thy
store.
028:006
Blessed
shalt
thou
be
when
thou
comest
in,
and
blessed
shalt
thou
be
when
thou
goest
out.
028:007
The
LORD
shall
cause
thine
enemies
