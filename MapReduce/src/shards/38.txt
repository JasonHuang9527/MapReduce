that
rise
up
against
thee
to
be
smitten
before
thy
face:
they
shall
come
out
against
thee
one
way,
and
flee
before
thee
seven
ways.
028:008
The
LORD
shall
command
the
blessing
upon
thee
in
thy
storehouses,
and
in
all
that
thou
settest
thine
hand
unto;
and
he
shall
bless
thee
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee.
028:009
The
LORD
shall
establish
thee
an
holy
people
unto
himself,
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thee,
if
thou
shalt
keep
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
walk
in
his
ways.
028:010
And
all
people
of
the
earth
shall
see
that
thou
art
called
by
the
name
of
the
LORD;
and
they
shall
be
afraid
of
thee.
028:011
And
the
LORD
shall
make
thee
plenteous
in
goods,
in
the
fruit
of
thy
body,
and
in
the
fruit
of
thy
cattle,
and
in
the
fruit
of
thy
ground,
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
give
thee.
028:012
The
LORD
shall
open
unto
thee
his
good
treasure,
the
heaven
to
give
the
rain
unto
thy
land
in
his
season,
and
to
bless
all
the
work
of
thine
hand:
and
thou
shalt
lend
unto
many
nations,
and
thou
shalt
not
borrow.
028:013
And
the
LORD
shall
make
thee
the
head,
and
not
the
tail;
and
thou
shalt
be
above
only,
and
thou
shalt
not
be
beneath;
if
that
thou
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
I
command
thee
this
day,
to
observe
and
to
do
them:
028:014
And
thou
shalt
not
go
aside
from
any
of
the
words
which
I
command
thee
this
day,
to
the
right
hand,
or
to
the
left,
to
go
after
other
gods
to
serve
them.
028:015
But
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
thou
wilt
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
observe
to
do
all
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
which
I
command
thee
this
day;
that
all
these
curses
shall
come
upon
thee,
and
overtake
thee:
028:016
Cursed
shalt
thou
be
in
the
city,
and
cursed
shalt
thou
be
in
the
field.
028:017
Cursed
shall
be
thy
basket
and
thy
store.
028:018
Cursed
shall
be
the
fruit
of
thy
body,
and
the
fruit
of
thy
land,
the
increase
of
thy
kine,
and
the
flocks
of
thy
sheep.
028:019
Cursed
shalt
thou
be
when
thou
comest
in,
and
cursed
shalt
thou
be
when
thou
goest
out.
028:020
The
LORD
shall
send
upon
thee
cursing,
vexation,
and
rebuke,
in
all
that
thou
settest
thine
hand
unto
for
to
do,
until
thou
be
destroyed,
and
until
thou
perish
quickly;
because
of
the
wickedness
of
thy
doings,
whereby
thou
hast
forsaken
me.
028:021
The
LORD
shall
make
the
pestilence
cleave
unto
thee,
until
he
have
consumed
thee
from
off
the
land,
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it.
028:022
The
LORD
shall
smite
thee
with
a
consumption,
and
with
a
fever,
and
with
an
inflammation,
and
with
an
extreme
burning,
and
with
the
sword,
and
with
blasting,
and
with
mildew;
and
they
shall
pursue
thee
until
thou
perish.
028:023
And
thy
heaven
that
is
over
thy
head
shall
be
brass,
and
the
earth
that
is
under
thee
shall
be
iron.
028:024
The
LORD
shall
make
the
rain
of
thy
land
powder
and
dust:
from
heaven
shall
it
come
down
upon
thee,
until
thou
be
destroyed.
028:025
The
LORD
shall
cause
thee
to
be
smitten
before
thine
enemies:
thou
shalt
go
out
one
way
against
them,
and
flee
seven
ways
before
them:
and
shalt
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth.
028:026
And
thy
carcase
shall
be
meat
unto
all
fowls
of
the
air,
and
unto
the
beasts
of
the
earth,
and
no
man
shall
fray
them
away.
028:027
The
LORD
will
smite
thee
with
the
botch
of
Egypt,
and
with
the
emerods,
and
with
the
scab,
and
with
the
itch,
whereof
thou
canst
not
be
healed.
028:028
The
LORD
shall
smite
thee
with
madness,
and
blindness,
and
astonishment
of
heart:
028:029
And
thou
shalt
grope
at
noonday,
as
the
blind
gropeth
in
darkness,
and
thou
shalt
not
prosper
in
thy
ways:
and
thou
shalt
be
only
oppressed
and
spoiled
evermore,
and
no
man
shall
save
thee.
028:030
Thou
shalt
betroth
a
wife,
and
another
man
shall
lie
with
her:
thou
shalt
build
an
house,
and
thou
shalt
not
dwell
therein:
thou
shalt
plant
a
vineyard,
and
shalt
not
gather
the
grapes
thereof.
028:031
Thine
ox
shall
be
slain
before
thine
eyes,
and
thou
shalt
not
eat
thereof:
thine
ass
shall
be
violently
taken
away
from
before
thy
face,
and
shall
not
be
restored
to
thee:
thy
sheep
shall
be
given
unto
thine
enemies,
and
thou
shalt
have
none
to
rescue
them.
028:032
Thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
given
unto
another
people,
and
thine
eyes
shall
look,
and
fail
with
longing
for
them
all
the
day
long;
and
there
shall
be
no
might
in
thine
hand.
028:033
The
fruit
of
thy
land,
and
all
thy
labours,
shall
a
nation
which
thou
knowest
not
eat
up;
and
thou
shalt
be
only
oppressed
and
crushed
alway:
028:034
So
that
thou
shalt
be
mad
for
the
sight
of
thine
eyes
which
thou
shalt
see.
028:035
The
LORD
shall
smite
thee
in
the
knees,
and
in
the
legs,
with
a
sore
botch
that
cannot
be
healed,
from
the
sole
of
thy
foot
unto
the
top
of
thy
head.
028:036
The
LORD
shall
bring
thee,
and
thy
king
which
thou
shalt
set
over
thee,
unto
a
nation
which
neither
thou
nor
thy
fathers
have
known;
and
there
shalt
thou
serve
other
gods,
wood
and
stone.
028:037
And
thou
shalt
become
an
astonishment,
a
proverb,
and
a
byword,
among
all
nations
whither
the
LORD
shall
lead
thee.
028:038
Thou
shalt
carry
much
seed
out
into
the
field,
and
shalt
gather
but
little
in;
for
the
locust
shall
consume
it.
028:039
Thou
shalt
plant
vineyards,
and
dress
them,
but
shalt
neither
drink
of
the
wine,
nor
gather
the
grapes;
for
the
worms
shall
eat
them.
028:040
Thou
shalt
have
olive
trees
throughout
all
thy
coasts,
but
thou
shalt
not
anoint
thyself
with
the
oil;
for
thine
olive
shall
cast
his
fruit.
028:041
Thou
shalt
beget
sons
and
daughters,
but
thou
shalt
not
enjoy
them;
for
they
shall
go
into
captivity.
028:042
All
thy
trees
and
fruit
of
thy
land
shall
the
locust
consume.
028:043
The
stranger
that
is
within
thee
shall
get
up
above
thee
very
high;
and
thou
shalt
come
down
very
low.
028:044
He
shall
lend
to
thee,
and
thou
shalt
not
lend
to
him:
he
shall
be
the
head,
and
thou
shalt
be
the
tail.
028:045
Moreover
all
these
curses
shall
come
upon
thee,
and
shall
pursue
thee,
and
overtake
thee,
till
thou
be
destroyed;
because
thou
hearkenedst
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
which
he
commanded
thee:
028:046
And
they
shall
be
upon
thee
for
a
sign
and
for
a
wonder,
and
upon
thy
seed
for
ever.
028:047
Because
thou
servedst
not
the
LORD
thy
God
with
joyfulness,
and
with
gladness
of
heart,
for
the
abundance
of
all
things;
028:048
Therefore
shalt
thou
serve
thine
enemies
which
the
LORD
shall
send
against
thee,
in
hunger,
and
in
thirst,
and
in
nakedness,
and
in
want
of
all
things:
and
he
shall
put
a
yoke
of
iron
upon
thy
neck,
until
he
have
destroyed
thee.
028:049
The
LORD
shall
bring
a
nation
against
thee
from
far,
from
the
end
of
the
earth,
as
swift
as
the
eagle
flieth;
a
nation
whose
tongue
thou
shalt
not
understand;
028:050
A
nation
of
fierce
countenance,
which
shall
not
regard
the
person
of
the
old,
nor
shew
favour
to
the
young:
028:051
And
he
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
thy
cattle,
and
the
fruit
of
thy
land,
until
thou
be
destroyed:
which
also
shall
not
leave
thee
either
corn,
wine,
or
oil,
or
the
increase
of
thy
kine,
or
flocks
of
thy
sheep,
until
he
have
destroyed
thee.
028:052
And
he
shall
besiege
thee
in
all
thy
gates,
until
thy
high
and
fenced
walls
come
down,
wherein
thou
trustedst,
throughout
all
thy
land:
and
he
shall
besiege
thee
in
all
thy
gates
throughout
all
thy
land,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
given
thee.
028:053
And
thou
shalt
eat
the
fruit
of
thine
own
body,
the
flesh
of
thy
sons
and
of
thy
daughters,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
given
thee,
in
the
siege,
and
in
the
straitness,
wherewith
thine
enemies
shall
distress
thee:
028:054
So
that
the
man
that
is
tender
among
you,
and
very
delicate,
his
eye
shall
be
evil
toward
his
brother,
and
toward
the
wife
of
his
bosom,
and
toward
the
remnant
of
his
children
which
he
shall
leave:
028:055
So
that
he
will
not
give
to
any
of
them
of
the
flesh
of
his
children
whom
he
shall
eat:
because
he
hath
nothing
left
him
in
the
siege,
and
in
the
straitness,
wherewith
thine
enemies
shall
distress
thee
in
all
thy
gates.
028:056
The
tender
and
delicate
woman
among
you,
which
would
not
adventure
to
set
the
sole
of
her
foot
upon
the
ground
for
delicateness
and
tenderness,
her
eye
shall
be
evil
toward
the
husband
of
her
bosom,
and
toward
her
son,
and
toward
her
daughter,
028:057
And
toward
her
young
one
that
cometh
out
from
between
her
feet,
and
toward
her
children
which
she
shall
bear:
for
she
shall
eat
them
for
want
of
all
things
secretly
in
the
siege
and
straitness,
wherewith
thine
enemy
shall
distress
thee
in
thy
gates.
028:058
If
thou
wilt
not
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
that
are
written
in
this
book,
that
thou
mayest
fear
this
glorious
and
fearful
name,
THE
LORD
THY
GOD;
028:059
Then
the
LORD
will
make
thy
plagues
wonderful,
and
the
plagues
of
thy
seed,
even
great
plagues,
and
of
long
continuance,
and
sore
sicknesses,
and
of
long
continuance.
028:060
Moreover
he
will
bring
upon
thee
all
the
diseases
of
Egypt,
which
thou
wast
afraid
of;
and
they
shall
cleave
unto
thee.
028:061
Also
every
sickness,
and
every
plague,
which
is
not
written
in
the
book
of
this
law,
them
will
the
LORD
bring
upon
thee,
until
thou
be
destroyed.
028:062
And
ye
shall
be
left
few
in
number,
whereas
ye
were
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
multitude;
because
thou
wouldest
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
028:063
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
as
the
LORD
rejoiced
over
you
to
do
you
good,
and
to
multiply
you;
so
the
LORD
will
rejoice
over
you
to
destroy
you,
and
to
bring
you
to
nought;
and
ye
shall
be
plucked
from
off
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it.
028:064
And
the
LORD
shall
scatter
thee
among
all
people,
from
the
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other;
and
there
thou
shalt
serve
other
gods,
which
neither
thou
nor
thy
fathers
have
known,
even
wood
and
stone.
028:065
And
among
these
nations
shalt
thou
find
no
ease,
neither
shall
the
sole
of
thy
foot
have
rest:
but
the
LORD
shall
give
thee
there
a
trembling
heart,
and
failing
of
eyes,
and
sorrow
of
mind:
028:066
And
thy
life
shall
hang
in
doubt
before
thee;
and
thou
shalt
fear
day
and
night,
and
shalt
have
none
assurance
of
thy
life:
028:067
In
the
morning
thou
shalt
say,
Would
God
it
were
even!
and
at
even
thou
shalt
say,
Would
God
it
were
morning!
for
the
fear
of
thine
heart
wherewith
thou
shalt
fear,
and
for
the
sight
of
thine
eyes
which
thou
shalt
see.
028:068
And
the
LORD
shall
bring
thee
into
Egypt
again
with
ships,
by
the
way
whereof
I
spake
unto
thee,
Thou
shalt
see
it
no
more
again:
and
there
ye
shall
be
sold
unto
your
enemies
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen,
and
no
man
shall
buy
you.
029:001
These
are
the
words
of
the
covenant,
which
the
LORD
commanded
Moses
to
make
with
the
children
of
Israel
in
the
land
of
Moab,
beside
the
covenant
which
he
made
with
them
in
Horeb.
029:002
And
Moses
called
unto
all
Israel,
and
said
unto
them,
Ye
have
seen
all
that
the
LORD
did
before
your
eyes
in
the
land
of
Egypt
unto
Pharaoh,
and
unto
all
his
servants,
and
unto
all
his
land;
029:003
The
great
temptations
which
thine
eyes
have
seen,
the
signs,
and
those
great
miracles:
029:004
Yet
the
LORD
hath
not
given
you
an
heart
to
perceive,
and
eyes
to
see,
and
ears
to
hear,
unto
this
day.
029:005
And
I
have
led
you
forty
years
in
the
wilderness:
your
clothes
are
not
waxen
old
upon
you,
and
thy
shoe
is
not
waxen
old
upon
thy
foot.
029:006
Ye
have
not
eaten
bread,
neither
have
ye
drunk
wine
or
strong
drink:
that
ye
might
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
your
God.
029:007
And
when
ye
came
unto
this
place,
Sihon
the
king
of
Heshbon,
and
Og
the
king
of
Bashan,
came
out
against
us
unto
battle,
and
we
smote
them:
029:008
And
we
took
their
land,
and
gave
it
for
an
inheritance
unto
the
Reubenites,
and
to
the
Gadites,
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh.
029:009
Keep
therefore
the
words
of
this
covenant,
and
do
them,
that
ye
may
prosper
in
all
that
ye
do.
029:010
Ye
stand
this
day
all
of
you
before
the
LORD
your
God;
your
captains
of
your
tribes,
your
elders,
and
your
officers,
with
all
the
men
of
Israel,
029:011
Your
little
ones,
your
wives,
and
thy
stranger
that
is
in
thy
camp,
from
the
hewer
of
thy
wood
unto
the
drawer
of
thy
water:
029:012
That
thou
shouldest
enter
into
covenant
with
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
into
his
oath,
which
the
LORD
thy
God
maketh
with
thee
this
day:
029:013
That
he
may
establish
thee
to
day
for
a
people
unto
himself,
and
that
he
may
be
unto
thee
a
God,
as
he
hath
said
unto
thee,
and
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thy
fathers,
to
Abraham,
to
Isaac,
and
to
Jacob.
029:014
Neither
with
you
only
do
I
make
this
covenant
and
this
oath;
029:015
But
with
him
that
standeth
here
with
us
this
day
before
the
LORD
our
God,
and
also
with
him
that
is
not
here
with
us
this
day:
029:016
(For
ye
know
how
we
have
dwelt
in
the
land
of
Egypt;
and
how
we
came
through
the
nations
which
ye
passed
by;
029:017
And
ye
have
seen
their
abominations,
and
their
idols,
wood
and
stone,
silver
and
gold,
which
were
among
them:)
029:018
Lest
there
should
be
among
you
man,
or
woman,
or
family,
or
tribe,
whose
heart
turneth
away
this
day
from
the
LORD
our
God,
to
go
and
serve
the
gods
of
these
nations;
lest
there
should
be
among
you
a
root
that
beareth
gall
and
wormwood;
029:019
And
it
come
to
pass,
when
he
heareth
the
words
of
this
curse,
that
he
bless
himself
in
his
heart,
saying,
I
shall
have
peace,
though
I
walk
in
the
imagination
of
mine
heart,
to
add
drunkenness
to
thirst:
029:020
The
LORD
will
not
spare
him,
but
then
the
anger
of
the
LORD
and
his
jealousy
shall
smoke
against
that
man,
and
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
this
book
shall
lie
upon
him,
and
the
LORD
shall
blot
out
his
name
from
under
heaven.
029:021
And
the
LORD
shall
separate
him
unto
evil
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
according
to
all
the
curses
of
the
covenant
that
are
written
in
this
book
of
the
law:
029:022
So
that
the
generation
to
come
of
your
children
that
shall
rise
up
after
you,
and
the
stranger
that
shall
come
from
a
far
land,
shall
say,
when
they
see
the
plagues
of
that
land,
and
the
sicknesses
which
the
LORD
hath
laid
upon
it;
029:023
And
that
the
whole
land
thereof
is
brimstone,
and
salt,
and
burning,
that
it
is
not
sown,
nor
beareth,
nor
any
grass
groweth
therein,
like
the
overthrow
of
Sodom,
and
Gomorrah,
Admah,
and
Zeboim,
which
the
LORD
overthrew
in
his
anger,
and
in
his
wrath:
029:024
Even
all
nations
shall
say,
Wherefore
hath
the
LORD
done
thus
unto
this
land?
what
meaneth
the
heat
of
this
great
anger?
029:025
Then
men
shall
say,
Because
they
have
forsaken
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers,
which
he
made
with
them
when
he
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt:
029:026
For
they
went
and
served
other
gods,
and
worshipped
them,
gods
whom
they
knew
not,
and
whom
he
had
not
given
unto
them:
029:027
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
this
land,
to
bring
upon
it
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
this
book:
029:028
And
the
LORD
rooted
them
out
of
their
land
in
anger,
and
in
wrath,
and
in
great
indignation,
and
cast
them
into
another
land,
as
it
is
this
day.
029:029
The
secret
things
belong
unto
the
LORD
our
God:
but
those
things
which
are
revealed
belong
unto
us
and
to
our
children
for
ever,
that
we
may
do
all
the
words
of
this
law.
030:001
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
all
these
things
are
come
upon
thee,
the
blessing
and
the
curse,
which
I
have
set
before
thee,
and
thou
shalt
call
them
to
mind
among
all
the
nations,
whither
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
driven
thee,
030:002
And
shalt
return
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
shalt
obey
his
voice
according
to
all
that
I
command
thee
this
day,
thou
and
thy
children,
with
all
thine
heart,
and
with
all
thy
soul;
030:003
That
then
the
LORD
thy
God
will
turn
thy
captivity,
and
have
compassion
upon
thee,
and
will
return
and
gather
thee
from
all
the
nations,
whither
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
scattered
thee.
030:004
If
any
of
thine
be
driven
out
unto
the
outmost
parts
of
heaven,
from
thence
will
the
LORD
thy
God
gather
thee,
and
from
thence
will
he
fetch
thee:
030:005
And
the
LORD
thy
God
will
bring
thee
into
the
land
which
thy
fathers
possessed,
and
thou
shalt
possess
it;
and
he
will
do
thee
good,
and
multiply
thee
above
thy
fathers.
030:006
And
the
LORD
thy
God
will
circumcise
thine
heart,
and
the
heart
of
thy
seed,
to
love
the
LORD
thy
God
with
all
thine
heart,
and
with
all
thy
soul,
that
thou
mayest
live.
030:007
And
the
LORD
thy
God
will
put
all
these
curses
upon
thine
enemies,
and
on
them
that
hate
thee,
which
persecuted
thee.
030:008
And
thou
shalt
return
and
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD,
and
do
all
his
commandments
which
I
command
thee
this
day.
030:009
And
the
LORD
thy
God
will
make
thee
plenteous
in
every
work
of
thine
hand,
in
the
fruit
of
thy
body,
and
in
the
fruit
of
thy
cattle,
and
in
the
fruit
of
thy
land,
for
good:
for
the
LORD
will
again
rejoice
over
thee
for
good,
as
he
rejoiced
over
thy
fathers:
030:010
If
thou
shalt
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
which
are
written
in
this
book
of
the
law,
and
if
thou
turn
unto
the
LORD
thy
God
with
all
thine
heart,
and
with
all
thy
soul.
030:011
For
this
commandment
which
I
command
thee
this
day,
it
is
not
hidden
from
thee,
neither
is
it
far
off.
030:012
It
is
not
in
heaven,
that
thou
shouldest
say,
Who
shall
go
up
for
us
to
heaven,
and
bring
it
unto
us,
that
we
may
hear
it,
and
do
it?
030:013
Neither
is
it
beyond
the
sea,
that
thou
shouldest
say,
Who
shall
go
over
the
sea
for
us,
and
bring
it
unto
us,
that
we
may
hear
it,
and
do
it?
030:014
But
the
word
is
very
nigh
unto
thee,
in
thy
mouth,
and
in
thy
heart,
that
thou
mayest
do
it.
030:015
See,
I
have
set
before
thee
this
day
life
and
good,
and
death
and
evil;
030:016
In
that
I
command
thee
this
day
to
love
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
walk
in
his
ways,
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
and
his
judgments,
that
thou
mayest
live
and
multiply:
and
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
bless
thee
in
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it.
030:017
But
if
thine
heart
turn
away,
so
that
thou
wilt
not
hear,
but
shalt
be
drawn
away,
and
worship
other
gods,
and
serve
them;
030:018
I
denounce
unto
you
this
day,
that
ye
shall
surely
perish,
and
that
ye
shall
not
prolong
your
days
upon
the
land,
whither
thou
passest
over
Jordan
to
go
to
possess
it.
030:019
I
call
heaven
and
earth
to
record
this
day
against
you,
that
I
have
set
before
you
life
and
death,
blessing
and
cursing:
therefore
choose
life,
that
both
thou
and
thy
seed
may
live:
030:020
That
thou
mayest
love
the
LORD
thy
God,
and
that
thou
mayest
obey
his
voice,
and
that
thou
mayest
cleave
unto
him:
for
he
is
thy
life,
and
the
length
of
thy
days:
that
thou
mayest
dwell
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
thy
fathers,
to
Abraham,
to
Isaac,
and
to
Jacob,
to
give
them.
031:001
And
Moses
went
and
spake
these
words
unto
all
Israel.
031:002
And
he
said
unto
them,
I
am
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
this
day;
I
can
no
more
go
out
and
come
in:
also
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
me,
Thou
shalt
not
go
over
this
Jordan.
031:003
The
LORD
thy
God,
he
will
go
over
before
thee,
and
he
will
destroy
these
nations
from
before
thee,
and
thou
shalt
possess
them:
and
Joshua,
he
shall
go
over
before
thee,
as
the
LORD
hath
said.
031:004
And
the
LORD
shall
do
unto
them
as
he
did
to
Sihon
and
to
Og,
kings
of
the
Amorites,
and
unto
the
land
of
them,
whom
he
destroyed.
031:005
And
the
LORD
shall
give
them
up
before
your
face,
that
ye
may
do
unto
them
according
unto
all
the
commandments
which
I
have
commanded
you.
031:006
Be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage,
fear
not,
nor
be
afraid
of
them:
for
the
LORD
thy
God,
he
it
is
that
doth
go
with
thee;
he
will
not
fail
thee,
nor
forsake
thee.
031:007
And
Moses
called
unto
Joshua,
and
said
unto
him
in
the
sight
of
all
Israel,
Be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage:
for
thou
must
go
with
this
people
unto
the
land
which
the
LORD
hath
sworn
unto
their
fathers
to
give
them;
and
thou
shalt
cause
them
to
inherit
it.
031:008
And
the
LORD,
he
it
is
that
doth
go
before
thee;
he
will
be
with
thee,
he
will
not
fail
thee,
neither
forsake
thee:
fear
not,
neither
be
dismayed.
031:009
And
Moses
wrote
this
law,
and
delivered
it
unto
the
priests
the
sons
of
Levi,
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
and
unto
all
the
elders
of
Israel.
031:010
And
Moses
commanded
them,
saying,
At
the
end
of
every
seven
years,
in
the
solemnity
of
the
year
of
release,
in
the
feast
of
tabernacles,
031:011
When
all
Israel
is
come
to
appear
before
the
LORD
thy
God
in
the
place
which
he
shall
choose,
thou
shalt
read
this
law
before
all
Israel
in
their
hearing.
031:012
Gather
the
people
together,
men
and
women,
and
children,
and
thy
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates,
that
they
may
hear,
and
that
they
may
learn,
and
fear
the
LORD
your
God,
and
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law:
031:013
And
that
their
children,
which
have
not
known
any
thing,
may
hear,
and
learn
to
fear
the
LORD
your
God,
as
long
as
ye
live
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
Jordan
to
possess
it.
031:014
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Behold,
thy
days
approach
that
thou
must
die:
call
Joshua,
and
present
yourselves
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
that
I
may
give
him
a
charge.
And
Moses
and
Joshua
went,
and
presented
themselves
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
031:015
And
the
LORD
appeared
in
the
tabernacle
in
a
pillar
of
a
cloud:
and
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
stood
over
the
door
of
the
tabernacle.
031:016
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses,
Behold,
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers;
and
this
people
will
rise
up,
and
go
a
whoring
after
the
gods
of
the
strangers
of
the
land,
whither
they
go
to
be
