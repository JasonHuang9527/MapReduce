among
them,
and
will
forsake
me,
and
break
my
covenant
which
I
have
made
with
them.
031:017
Then
my
anger
shall
be
kindled
against
them
in
that
day,
and
I
will
forsake
them,
and
I
will
hide
my
face
from
them,
and
they
shall
be
devoured,
and
many
evils
and
troubles
shall
befall
them;
so
that
they
will
say
in
that
day,
Are
not
these
evils
come
upon
us,
because
our
God
is
not
among
us?
031:018
And
I
will
surely
hide
my
face
in
that
day
for
all
the
evils
which
they
shall
have
wrought,
in
that
they
are
turned
unto
other
gods.
031:019
Now
therefore
write
ye
this
song
for
you,
and
teach
it
the
children
of
Israel:
put
it
in
their
mouths,
that
this
song
may
be
a
witness
for
me
against
the
children
of
Israel.
031:020
For
when
I
shall
have
brought
them
into
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
their
fathers,
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey;
and
they
shall
have
eaten
and
filled
themselves,
and
waxen
fat;
then
will
they
turn
unto
other
gods,
and
serve
them,
and
provoke
me,
and
break
my
covenant.
031:021
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
many
evils
and
troubles
are
befallen
them,
that
this
song
shall
testify
against
them
as
a
witness;
for
it
shall
not
be
forgotten
out
of
the
mouths
of
their
seed:
for
I
know
their
imagination
which
they
go
about,
even
now,
before
I
have
brought
them
into
the
land
which
I
sware.
031:022
Moses
therefore
wrote
this
song
the
same
day,
and
taught
it
the
children
of
Israel.
031:023
And
he
gave
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
a
charge,
and
said,
Be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage:
for
thou
shalt
bring
the
children
of
Israel
into
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
them:
and
I
will
be
with
thee.
031:024
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Moses
had
made
an
end
of
writing
the
words
of
this
law
in
a
book,
until
they
were
finished,
031:025
That
Moses
commanded
the
Levites,
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
saying,
031:026
Take
this
book
of
the
law,
and
put
it
in
the
side
of
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
your
God,
that
it
may
be
there
for
a
witness
against
thee.
031:027
For
I
know
thy
rebellion,
and
thy
stiff
neck:
behold,
while
I
am
yet
alive
with
you
this
day,
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
LORD;
and
how
much
more
after
my
death?
031:028
Gather
unto
me
all
the
elders
of
your
tribes,
and
your
officers,
that
I
may
speak
these
words
in
their
ears,
and
call
heaven
and
earth
to
record
against
them.
031:029
For
I
know
that
after
my
death
ye
will
utterly
corrupt
yourselves,
and
turn
aside
from
the
way
which
I
have
commanded
you;
and
evil
will
befall
you
in
the
latter
days;
because
ye
will
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
to
provoke
him
to
anger
through
the
work
of
your
hands.
031:030
And
Moses
spake
in
the
ears
of
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
the
words
of
this
song,
until
they
were
ended.
032:001
Give
ear,
O
ye
heavens,
and
I
will
speak;
and
hear,
O
earth,
the
words
of
my
mouth.
032:002
My
doctrine
shall
drop
as
the
rain,
my
speech
shall
distil
as
the
dew,
as
the
small
rain
upon
the
tender
herb,
and
as
the
showers
upon
the
grass:
032:003
Because
I
will
publish
the
name
of
the
LORD:
ascribe
ye
greatness
unto
our
God.
032:004
He
is
the
Rock,
his
work
is
perfect:
for
all
his
ways
are
judgment:
a
God
of
truth
and
without
iniquity,
just
and
right
is
he.
032:005
They
have
corrupted
themselves,
their
spot
is
not
the
spot
of
his
children:
they
are
a
perverse
and
crooked
generation.
032:006
Do
ye
thus
requite
the
LORD,
O
foolish
people
and
unwise?
is
not
he
thy
father
that
hath
bought
thee?
hath
he
not
made
thee,
and
established
thee?
032:007
Remember
the
days
of
old,
consider
the
years
of
many
generations:
ask
thy
father,
and
he
will
shew
thee;
thy
elders,
and
they
will
tell
thee.
032:008
When
the
Most
High
divided
to
the
nations
their
inheritance,
when
he
separated
the
sons
of
Adam,
he
set
the
bounds
of
the
people
according
to
the
number
of
the
children
of
Israel.
032:009
For
the
LORD's
portion
is
his
people;
Jacob
is
the
lot
of
his
inheritance.
032:010
He
found
him
in
a
desert
land,
and
in
the
waste
howling
wilderness;
he
led
him
about,
he
instructed
him,
he
kept
him
as
the
apple
of
his
eye.
032:011
As
an
eagle
stirreth
up
her
nest,
fluttereth
over
her
young,
spreadeth
abroad
her
wings,
taketh
them,
beareth
them
on
her
wings:
032:012
So
the
LORD
alone
did
lead
him,
and
there
was
no
strange
god
with
him.
032:013
He
made
him
ride
on
the
high
places
of
the
earth,
that
he
might
eat
the
increase
of
the
fields;
and
he
made
him
to
suck
honey
out
of
the
rock,
and
oil
out
of
the
flinty
rock;
032:014
Butter
of
kine,
and
milk
of
sheep,
with
fat
of
lambs,
and
rams
of
the
breed
of
Bashan,
and
goats,
with
the
fat
of
kidneys
of
wheat;
and
thou
didst
drink
the
pure
blood
of
the
grape.
032:015
But
Jeshurun
waxed
fat,
and
kicked:
thou
art
waxen
fat,
thou
art
grown
thick,
thou
art
covered
with
fatness;
then
he
forsook
God
which
made
him,
and
lightly
esteemed
the
Rock
of
his
salvation.
032:016
They
provoked
him
to
jealousy
with
strange
gods,
with
abominations
provoked
they
him
to
anger.
032:017
They
sacrificed
unto
devils,
not
to
God;
to
gods
whom
they
knew
not,
to
new
gods
that
came
newly
up,
whom
your
fathers
feared
not.
032:018
Of
the
Rock
that
begat
thee
thou
art
unmindful,
and
hast
forgotten
God
that
formed
thee.
032:019
And
when
the
LORD
saw
it,
he
abhorred
them,
because
of
the
provoking
of
his
sons,
and
of
his
daughters.
032:020
And
he
said,
I
will
hide
my
face
from
them,
I
will
see
what
their
end
shall
be:
for
they
are
a
very
froward
generation,
children
in
whom
is
no
faith.
032:021
They
have
moved
me
to
jealousy
with
that
which
is
not
God;
they
have
provoked
me
to
anger
with
their
vanities:
and
I
will
move
them
to
jealousy
with
those
which
are
not
a
people;
I
will
provoke
them
to
anger
with
a
foolish
nation.
032:022
For
a
fire
is
kindled
in
mine
anger,
and
shall
burn
unto
the
lowest
hell,
and
shall
consume
the
earth
with
her
increase,
and
set
on
fire
the
foundations
of
the
mountains.
032:023
I
will
heap
mischiefs
upon
them;
I
will
spend
mine
arrows
upon
them.
032:024
They
shall
be
burnt
with
hunger,
and
devoured
with
burning
heat,
and
with
bitter
destruction:
I
will
also
send
the
teeth
of
beasts
upon
them,
with
the
poison
of
serpents
of
the
dust.
032:025
The
sword
without,
and
terror
within,
shall
destroy
both
the
young
man
and
the
virgin,
the
suckling
also
with
the
man
of
gray
hairs.
032:026
I
said,
I
would
scatter
them
into
corners,
I
would
make
the
remembrance
of
them
to
cease
from
among
men:
032:027
Were
it
not
that
I
feared
the
wrath
of
the
enemy,
lest
their
adversaries
should
behave
themselves
strangely,
and
lest
they
should
say,
Our
hand
is
high,
and
the
LORD
hath
not
done
all
this.
032:028
For
they
are
a
nation
void
of
counsel,
neither
is
there
any
understanding
in
them.
032:029
O
that
they
were
wise,
that
they
understood
this,
that
they
would
consider
their
latter
end!
032:030
How
should
one
chase
a
thousand,
and
two
put
ten
thousand
to
flight,
except
their
Rock
had
sold
them,
and
the
LORD
had
shut
them
up?
032:031
For
their
rock
is
not
as
our
Rock,
even
our
enemies
themselves
being
judges.
032:032
For
their
vine
is
of
the
vine
of
Sodom,
and
of
the
fields
of
Gomorrah:
their
grapes
are
grapes
of
gall,
their
clusters
are
bitter:
032:033
Their
wine
is
the
poison
of
dragons,
and
the
cruel
venom
of
asps.
032:034
Is
not
this
laid
up
in
store
with
me,
and
sealed
up
among
my
treasures?
032:035
To
me
belongeth
vengeance
and
recompence;
their
foot
shall
slide
in
due
time:
for
the
day
of
their
calamity
is
at
hand,
and
the
things
that
shall
come
upon
them
make
haste.
032:036
For
the
LORD
shall
judge
his
people,
and
repent
himself
for
his
servants,
when
he
seeth
that
their
power
is
gone,
and
there
is
none
shut
up,
or
left.
032:037
And
he
shall
say,
Where
are
their
gods,
their
rock
in
whom
they
trusted,
032:038
Which
did
eat
the
fat
of
their
sacrifices,
and
drank
the
wine
of
their
drink
offerings?
let
them
rise
up
and
help
you,
and
be
your
protection.
032:039
See
now
that
I,
even
I,
am
he,
and
there
is
no
god
with
me:
I
kill,
and
I
make
alive;
I
wound,
and
I
heal:
neither
is
there
any
that
can
deliver
out
of
my
hand.
032:040
For
I
lift
up
my
hand
to
heaven,
and
say,
I
live
for
ever.
032:041
If
I
whet
my
glittering
sword,
and
mine
hand
take
hold
on
judgment;
I
will
render
vengeance
to
mine
enemies,
and
will
reward
them
that
hate
me.
032:042
I
will
make
mine
arrows
drunk
with
blood,
and
my
sword
shall
devour
flesh;
and
that
with
the
blood
of
the
slain
and
of
the
captives,
from
the
beginning
of
revenges
upon
the
enemy.
032:043
Rejoice,
O
ye
nations,
with
his
people:
for
he
will
avenge
the
blood
of
his
servants,
and
will
render
vengeance
to
his
adversaries,
and
will
be
merciful
unto
his
land,
and
to
his
people.
032:044
And
Moses
came
and
spake
all
the
words
of
this
song
in
the
ears
of
the
people,
he,
and
Hoshea
the
son
of
Nun.
032:045
And
Moses
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
these
words
to
all
Israel:
032:046
And
he
said
unto
them,
Set
your
hearts
unto
all
the
words
which
I
testify
among
you
this
day,
which
ye
shall
command
your
children
to
observe
to
do,
all
the
words
of
this
law.
032:047
For
it
is
not
a
vain
thing
for
you;
because
it
is
your
life:
and
through
this
thing
ye
shall
prolong
your
days
in
the
land,
whither
ye
go
over
Jordan
to
possess
it.
032:048
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Moses
that
selfsame
day,
saying,
032:049
Get
thee
up
into
this
mountain
Abarim,
unto
mount
Nebo,
which
is
in
the
land
of
Moab,
that
is
over
against
Jericho;
and
behold
the
land
of
Canaan,
which
I
give
unto
the
children
of
Israel
for
a
possession:
032:050
And
die
in
the
mount
whither
thou
goest
up,
and
be
gathered
unto
thy
people;
as
Aaron
thy
brother
died
in
mount
Hor,
and
was
gathered
unto
his
people:
032:051
Because
ye
trespassed
against
me
among
the
children
of
Israel
at
the
waters
of
MeribahKadesh,
in
the
wilderness
of
Zin;
because
ye
sanctified
me
not
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
Israel.
032:052
Yet
thou
shalt
see
the
land
before
thee;
but
thou
shalt
not
go
thither
unto
the
land
which
I
give
the
children
of
Israel.
033:001
And
this
is
the
blessing,
wherewith
Moses
the
man
of
God
blessed
the
children
of
Israel
before
his
death.
033:002
And
he
said,
The
LORD
came
from
Sinai,
and
rose
up
from
Seir
unto
them;
he
shined
forth
from
mount
Paran,
and
he
came
with
ten
thousands
of
saints:
from
his
right
hand
went
a
fiery
law
for
them.
033:003
Yea,
he
loved
the
people;
all
his
saints
are
in
thy
hand:
and
they
sat
down
at
thy
feet;
every
one
shall
receive
of
thy
words.
033:004
Moses
commanded
us
a
law,
even
the
inheritance
of
the
congregation
of
Jacob.
033:005
And
he
was
king
in
Jeshurun,
when
the
heads
of
the
people
and
the
tribes
of
Israel
were
gathered
together.
033:006
Let
Reuben
live,
and
not
die;
and
let
not
his
men
be
few.
033:007
And
this
is
the
blessing
of
Judah:
and
he
said,
Hear,
LORD,
the
voice
of
Judah,
and
bring
him
unto
his
people:
let
his
hands
be
sufficient
for
him;
and
be
thou
an
help
to
him
from
his
enemies.
033:008
And
of
Levi
he
said,
Let
thy
Thummim
and
thy
Urim
be
with
thy
holy
one,
whom
thou
didst
prove
at
Massah,
and
with
whom
thou
didst
strive
at
the
waters
of
Meribah;
033:009
Who
said
unto
his
father
and
to
his
mother,
I
have
not
seen
him;
neither
did
he
acknowledge
his
brethren,
nor
knew
his
own
children:
for
they
have
observed
thy
word,
and
kept
thy
covenant.
033:010
They
shall
teach
Jacob
thy
judgments,
and
Israel
thy
law:
they
shall
put
incense
before
thee,
and
whole
burnt
sacrifice
upon
thine
altar.
033:011
Bless,
LORD,
his
substance,
and
accept
the
work
of
his
hands;
smite
through
the
loins
of
them
that
rise
against
him,
and
of
them
that
hate
him,
that
they
rise
not
again.
033:012
And
of
Benjamin
he
said,
The
beloved
of
the
LORD
shall
dwell
in
safety
by
him;
and
the
Lord
shall
cover
him
all
the
day
long,
and
he
shall
dwell
between
his
shoulders.
033:013
And
of
Joseph
he
said,
Blessed
of
the
LORD
be
his
land,
for
the
precious
things
of
heaven,
for
the
dew,
and
for
the
deep
that
coucheth
beneath,
033:014
And
for
the
precious
fruits
brought
forth
by
the
sun,
and
for
the
precious
things
put
forth
by
the
moon,
033:015
And
for
the
chief
things
of
the
ancient
mountains,
and
for
the
precious
things
of
the
lasting
hills,
033:016
And
for
the
precious
things
of
the
earth
and
fulness
thereof,
and
for
the
good
will
of
him
that
dwelt
in
the
bush:
let
the
blessing
come
upon
the
head
of
Joseph,
and
upon
the
top
of
the
head
of
him
that
was
separated
from
his
brethren.
033:017
His
glory
is
like
the
firstling
of
his
bullock,
and
his
horns
are
like
the
horns
of
unicorns:
with
them
he
shall
push
the
people
together
to
the
ends
of
the
earth:
and
they
are
the
ten
thousands
of
Ephraim,
and
they
are
the
thousands
of
Manasseh.
033:018
And
of
Zebulun
he
said,
Rejoice,
Zebulun,
in
thy
going
out;
and,
Issachar,
in
thy
tents.
033:019
They
shall
call
the
people
unto
the
mountain;
there
they
shall
offer
sacrifices
of
righteousness:
for
they
shall
suck
of
the
abundance
of
the
seas,
and
of
treasures
hid
in
the
sand.
033:020
And
of
Gad
he
said,
Blessed
be
he
that
enlargeth
Gad:
he
dwelleth
as
a
lion,
and
teareth
the
arm
with
the
crown
of
the
head.
033:021
And
he
provided
the
first
part
for
himself,
because
there,
in
a
portion
of
the
lawgiver,
was
he
seated;
and
he
came
with
the
heads
of
the
people,
he
executed
the
justice
of
the
LORD,
and
his
judgments
with
Israel.
033:022
And
of
Dan
he
said,
Dan
is
a
lion's
whelp:
he
shall
leap
from
Bashan.
033:023
And
of
Naphtali
he
said,
O
Naphtali,
satisfied
with
favour,
and
full
with
the
blessing
of
the
LORD:
possess
thou
the
west
and
the
south.
033:024
And
of
Asher
he
said,
Let
Asher
be
blessed
with
children;
let
him
be
acceptable
to
his
brethren,
and
let
him
dip
his
foot
in
oil.
033:025
Thy
shoes
shall
be
iron
and
brass;
and
as
thy
days,
so
shall
thy
strength
be.
033:026
There
is
none
like
unto
the
God
of
Jeshurun,
who
rideth
upon
the
heaven
in
thy
help,
and
in
his
excellency
on
the
sky.
033:027
The
eternal
God
is
thy
refuge,
and
underneath
are
the
everlasting
arms:
and
he
shall
thrust
out
the
enemy
from
before
thee;
and
shall
say,
Destroy
them.
033:028
Israel
then
shall
dwell
in
safety
alone:
the
fountain
of
Jacob
shall
be
upon
a
land
of
corn
and
wine;
also
his
heavens
shall
drop
down
dew.
033:029
Happy
art
thou,
O
Israel:
who
is
like
unto
thee,
O
people
saved
by
the
LORD,
the
shield
of
thy
help,
and
who
is
the
sword
of
thy
excellency!
and
thine
enemies
shall
be
found
liars
unto
thee;
and
thou
shalt
tread
upon
their
high
places.
034:001
And
Moses
went
up
from
the
plains
of
Moab
unto
the
mountain
of
Nebo,
to
the
top
of
Pisgah,
that
is
over
against
Jericho.
And
the
LORD
shewed
him
all
the
land
of
Gilead,
unto
Dan,
034:002
And
all
Naphtali,
and
the
land
of
Ephraim,
and
Manasseh,
and
all
the
land
of
Judah,
unto
the
utmost
sea,
034:003
And
the
south,
and
the
plain
of
the
valley
of
Jericho,
the
city
of
palm
trees,
unto
Zoar.
034:004
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
This
is
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
Abraham,
unto
Isaac,
and
unto
Jacob,
saying,
I
will
give
it
unto
thy
seed:
I
have
caused
thee
to
see
it
with
thine
eyes,
but
thou
shalt
not
go
over
thither.
034:005
So
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
died
there
in
the
land
of
Moab,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD.
034:006
And
he
buried
him
in
a
valley
in
the
land
of
Moab,
over
against
Bethpeor:
but
no
man
knoweth
of
his
sepulchre
unto
this
day.
034:007
And
Moses
was
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
died:
his
eye
was
not
dim,
nor
his
natural
force
abated.
034:008
And
the
children
of
Israel
wept
for
Moses
in
the
plains
of
Moab
thirty
days:
so
the
days
of
weeping
and
mourning
for
Moses
were
ended.
034:009
And
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
was
full
of
the
spirit
of
wisdom;
for
Moses
had
laid
his
hands
upon
him:
and
the
children
of
Israel
hearkened
unto
him,
and
did
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
034:010
And
there
arose
not
a
prophet
since
in
Israel
like
unto
Moses,
whom
the
LORD
knew
face
to
face,
034:011
In
all
the
signs
and
the
wonders,
which
the
LORD
sent
him
to
do
in
the
land
of
Egypt
to
Pharaoh,
and
to
all
his
servants,
and
to
all
his
land,
034:012
And
in
all
that
mighty
hand,
and
in
all
the
great
terror
which
Moses
shewed
in
the
sight
of
all
Israel.
Book
06	Joshua
001:001
Now
after
the
death
of
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
it
came
to
pass,
that
the
LORD
spake
unto
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
Moses'
minister,
saying,
001:002
Moses
my
servant
is
dead;
now
therefore
arise,
go
over
this
Jordan,
thou,
and
all
this
people,
unto
the
land
which
I
do
give
to
them,
even
to
the
children
of
Israel.
001:003
Every
place
that
the
sole
of
your
foot
shall
tread
upon,
that
have
I
given
unto
you,
as
I
said
unto
Moses.
001:004
From
the
wilderness
and
this
Lebanon
even
unto
the
great
river,
the
river
Euphrates,
all
the
land
of
the
Hittites,
and
unto
the
great
sea
toward
the
going
down
of
the
sun,
shall
be
your
coast.
001:005
There
shall
not
any
man
be
able
to
stand
before
thee
all
the
days
of
thy
life:
as
I
was
with
Moses,
so
I
will
be
with
thee:
I
will
not
fail
thee,
nor
forsake
thee.
001:006
Be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage:
for
unto
this
people
shalt
thou
divide
for
an
inheritance
the
land,
which
I
sware
unto
their
fathers
to
give
them.
001:007
Only
be
thou
strong
and
very
courageous,
that
thou
mayest
observe
to
do
according
to
all
the
law,
which
Moses
my
servant
commanded
thee:
turn
not
from
it
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left,
that
thou
mayest
prosper
withersoever
thou
goest.
001:008
This
book
of
the
law
shall
not
depart
out
of
thy
mouth;
but
thou
shalt
meditate
therein
day
and
night,
that
thou
mayest
observe
to
do
according
to
all
that
is
written
therein:
for
then
thou
shalt
make
thy
way
prosperous,
and
then
thou
shalt
have
good
success.
001:009
Have
not
I
commanded
thee?
Be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage;
be
not
afraid,
neither
be
thou
dismayed:
for
the
LORD
thy
God
is
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest.
001:010
Then
Joshua
commanded
the
officers
of
the
people,
saying,
001:011
Pass
through
the
host,
and
command
the
people,
saying,
Prepare
you
victuals;
for
within
three
days
ye
shall
pass
over
this
Jordan,
to
go
in
to
possess
the
land,
which
the
LORD
your
God
giveth
you
to
possess
it.
001:012
And
to
the
Reubenites,
and
to
the
Gadites,
and
to
half
the
tribe
of
Manasseh,
spake
Joshua,
saying,
001:013
Remember
the
word
which
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
commanded
you,
saying,
The
LORD
your
God
hath
given
you
rest,
and
hath
given
you
this
land.
001:014
Your
wives,
your
little
ones,
and
your
cattle,
shall
remain
in
the
land
which
Moses
gave
you
on
this
side
Jordan;
but
ye
shall
pass
before
your
brethren
armed,
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour,
and
help
them;
001:015
Until
the
LORD
have
given
your
brethren
rest,
as
he
hath
given
you,
and
they
also
have
possessed
the
land
which
the
LORD
your
God
giveth
them:
then
ye
shall
return
unto
the
land
of
your
possession,
and
enjoy
it,
which
Moses
the
LORD's
servant
gave
you
on
this
side
Jordan
toward
the
sunrising.
001:016
And
they
answered
Joshua,
saying,
All
that
thou
commandest
us
we
will
do,
and
whithersoever
thou
sendest
us,
we
will
go.
001:017
According
as
we
hearkened
unto
Moses
in
all
things,
so
will
we
hearken
unto
thee:
only
the
LORD
thy
God
be
with
thee,
as
he
was
with
Moses.
001:018
Whosoever
he
be
that
doth
rebel
against
thy
commandment,
and
will
not
hearken
unto
thy
words
in
all
that
thou
commandest
him,
he
shall
be
put
to
death:
only
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage.
002:001
And
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
sent
out
of
Shittim
two
men
to
spy
secretly,
saying,
Go
view
the
land,
even
Jericho.
And
they
went,
and
came
into
an
harlot's
house,
named
Rahab,
and
lodged
there.
002:002
And
it
was
told
the
king
of
Jericho,
saying,
Behold,
there
came
men
in
hither
to
night
of
the
children
of
Israel
to
search
out
the
country.
002:003
And
the
king
of
Jericho
sent
unto
Rahab,
saying,
Bring
forth
the
men
that
are
come
to
thee,
which
are
entered
into
thine
house:
for
they
be
come
to
search
out
all
the
country.
002:004
And
the
woman
took
the
two
men,
and
hid
them,
and
said
thus,
There
came
men
unto
me,
but
I
wist
not
whence
they
were:
002:005
And
it
came
to
pass
about
the
time
of
shutting
of
the
gate,
when
it
was
dark,
that
the
men
went
out:
whither
the
men
went
I
wot
not:
pursue
after
them
quickly;
for
ye
shall
overtake
them.
002:006
But
she
had
brought
them
up
to
the
roof
of
the
house,
and
hid
them
with
the
stalks
of
flax,
which
she
had
laid
in
order
upon
the
roof.
002:007
And
the
men
pursued
after
them
the
way
to
Jordan
unto
the
fords:
and
as
soon
as
they
which
pursued
after
them
were
gone
out,
they
shut
the
gate.
002:008
And
before
they
were
laid
down,
she
came
up
unto
them
upon
the
roof;
002:009
And
she
said
unto
the
men,
I
know
that
the
LORD
hath
given
you
the
land,
and
that
your
terror
is
fallen
upon
us,
and
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
faint
because
of
you.
002:010
For
we
have
heard
how
the
LORD
dried
up
the
water
of
the
Red
sea
for
you,
when
ye
came
out
of
Egypt;
and
what
ye
did
unto
the
two
kings
of
the
Amorites,
that
were
on
the
other
side
Jordan,
Sihon
and
Og,
whom
ye
utterly
destroyed.
002:011
And
as
soon
as
we
had
heard
these
things,
our
hearts
did
melt,
neither
did
there
remain
any
more
courage
in
any
man,
because
of
you:
for
the
LORD
your
God,
he
is
God
in
heaven
above,
and
in
earth
beneath.
002:012
Now
therefore,
I
pray
you,
swear
unto
me
by
the
LORD,
since
I
have
shewed
you
kindness,
that
ye
will
also
shew
kindness
unto
my
father's
house,
and
give
me
a
true
token:
002:013
And
that
ye
will
save
alive
my
father,
and
my
mother,
and
my
brethren,
and
my
sisters,
and
all
that
they
have,
and
deliver
our
lives
from
death.
002:014
And
the
men
answered
her,
Our
life
for
yours,
if
ye
utter
not
this
our
business.
And
it
shall
be,
