also
draw
for
thy
camels:
let
the
same
be
the
woman
whom
the
LORD
hath
appointed
out
for
my
master's
son.
024:045
And
before
I
had
done
speaking
in
mine
heart,
behold,
Rebekah
came
forth
with
her
pitcher
on
her
shoulder;
and
she
went
down
unto
the
well,
and
drew
water:
and
I
said
unto
her,
Let
me
drink,
I
pray
thee.
024:046
And
she
made
haste,
and
let
down
her
pitcher
from
her
shoulder,
and
said,
Drink,
and
I
will
give
thy
camels
drink
also:
so
I
drank,
and
she
made
the
camels
drink
also.
024:047
And
I
asked
her,
and
said,
Whose
daughter
art
thou?
And
she
said,
the
daughter
of
Bethuel,
Nahor's
son,
whom
Milcah
bare
unto
him:
and
I
put
the
earring
upon
her
face,
and
the
bracelets
upon
her
hands.
024:048
And
I
bowed
down
my
head,
and
worshipped
the
LORD,
and
blessed
the
LORD
God
of
my
master
Abraham,
which
had
led
me
in
the
right
way
to
take
my
master's
brother's
daughter
unto
his
son.
024:049
And
now
if
ye
will
deal
kindly
and
truly
with
my
master,
tell
me:
and
if
not,
tell
me;
that
I
may
turn
to
the
right
hand,
or
to
the
left.
024:050
Then
Laban
and
Bethuel
answered
and
said,
The
thing
proceedeth
from
the
LORD:
we
cannot
speak
unto
thee
bad
or
good.
024:051
Behold,
Rebekah
is
before
thee,
take
her,
and
go,
and
let
her
be
thy
master's
son's
wife,
as
the
LORD
hath
spoken.
024:052
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
Abraham's
servant
heard
their
words,
he
worshipped
the
LORD,
bowing
himself
to
the
earth.
024:053
And
the
servant
brought
forth
jewels
of
silver,
and
jewels
of
gold,
and
raiment,
and
gave
them
to
Rebekah:
he
gave
also
to
her
brother
and
to
her
mother
precious
things.
024:054
And
they
did
eat
and
drink,
he
and
the
men
that
were
with
him,
and
tarried
all
night;
and
they
rose
up
in
the
morning,
and
he
said,
Send
me
away
unto
my
master.
024:055
And
her
brother
and
her
mother
said,
Let
the
damsel
abide
with
us
a
few
days,
at
the
least
ten;
after
that
she
shall
go.
024:056
And
he
said
unto
them,
Hinder
me
not,
seeing
the
LORD
hath
prospered
my
way;
send
me
away
that
I
may
go
to
my
master.
024:057
And
they
said,
We
will
call
the
damsel,
and
enquire
at
her
mouth.
024:058
And
they
called
Rebekah,
and
said
unto
her,
Wilt
thou
go
with
this
man?
And
she
said,
I
will
go.
024:059
And
they
sent
away
Rebekah
their
sister,
and
her
nurse,
and
Abraham's
servant,
and
his
men.
024:060
And
they
blessed
Rebekah,
and
said
unto
her,
Thou
art
our
sister,
be
thou
the
mother
of
thousands
of
millions,
and
let
thy
seed
possess
the
gate
of
those
which
hate
them.
024:061
And
Rebekah
arose,
and
her
damsels,
and
they
rode
upon
the
camels,
and
followed
the
man:
and
the
servant
took
Rebekah,
and
went
his
way.
024:062
And
Isaac
came
from
the
way
of
the
well
Lahairoi;
for
he
dwelt
in
the
south
country.
024:063
And
Isaac
went
out
to
meditate
in
the
field
at
the
eventide:
and
he
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
saw,
and,
behold,
the
camels
were
coming.
024:064
And
Rebekah
lifted
up
her
eyes,
and
when
she
saw
Isaac,
she
lighted
off
the
camel.
024:065
For
she
had
said
unto
the
servant,
What
man
is
this
that
walketh
in
the
field
to
meet
us?
And
the
servant
had
said,
It
is
my
master:
therefore
she
took
a
vail,
and
covered
herself.
024:066
And
the
servant
told
Isaac
all
things
that
he
had
done.
024:067
And
Isaac
brought
her
into
his
mother
Sarah's
tent,
and
took
Rebekah,
and
she
became
his
wife;
and
he
loved
her:
and
Isaac
was
comforted
after
his
mother's
death.
025:001
Then
again
Abraham
took
a
wife,
and
her
name
was
Keturah.
025:002
And
she
bare
him
Zimran,
and
Jokshan,
and
Medan,
and
Midian,
and
Ishbak,
and
Shuah.
025:003
And
Jokshan
begat
Sheba,
and
Dedan.
And
the
sons
of
Dedan
were
Asshurim,
and
Letushim,
and
Leummim.
025:004
And
the
sons
of
Midian;
Ephah,
and
Epher,
and
Hanoch,
and
Abidah,
and
Eldaah.
All
these
were
the
children
of
Keturah.
025:005
And
Abraham
gave
all
that
he
had
unto
Isaac.
025:006
But
unto
the
sons
of
the
concubines,
which
Abraham
had,
Abraham
gave
gifts,
and
sent
them
away
from
Isaac
his
son,
while
he
yet
lived,
eastward,
unto
the
east
country.
025:007
And
these
are
the
days
of
the
years
of
Abraham's
life
which
he
lived,
an
hundred
threescore
and
fifteen
years.
025:008
Then
Abraham
gave
up
the
ghost,
and
died
in
a
good
old
age,
an
old
man,
and
full
of
years;
and
was
gathered
to
his
people.
025:009
And
his
sons
Isaac
and
Ishmael
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
Machpelah,
in
the
field
of
Ephron
the
son
of
Zohar
the
Hittite,
which
is
before
Mamre;
025:010
The
field
which
Abraham
purchased
of
the
sons
of
Heth:
there
was
Abraham
buried,
and
Sarah
his
wife.
025:011
And
it
came
to
pass
after
the
death
of
Abraham,
that
God
blessed
his
son
Isaac;
and
Isaac
dwelt
by
the
well
Lahairoi.
025:012
Now
these
are
the
generations
of
Ishmael,
Abraham's
son,
whom
Hagar
the
Egyptian,
Sarah's
handmaid,
bare
unto
Abraham:
025:013
And
these
are
the
names
of
the
sons
of
Ishmael,
by
their
names,
according
to
their
generations:
the
firstborn
of
Ishmael,
Nebajoth;
and
Kedar,
and
Adbeel,
and
Mibsam,
025:014
And
Mishma,
and
Dumah,
and
Massa,
025:015
Hadar,
and
Tema,
Jetur,
Naphish,
and
Kedemah:
025:016
These
are
the
sons
of
Ishmael,
and
these
are
their
names,
by
their
towns,
and
by
their
castles;
twelve
princes
according
to
their
nations.
025:017
And
these
are
the
years
of
the
life
of
Ishmael,
an
hundred
and
thirty
and
seven
years:
and
he
gave
up
the
ghost
and
died;
and
was
gathered
unto
his
people.
025:018
And
they
dwelt
from
Havilah
unto
Shur,
that
is
before
Egypt,
as
thou
goest
toward
Assyria:
and
he
died
in
the
presence
of
all
his
brethren.
025:019
And
these
are
the
generations
of
Isaac,
Abraham's
son:
Abraham
begat
Isaac:
025:020
And
Isaac
was
forty
years
old
when
he
took
Rebekah
to
wife,
the
daughter
of
Bethuel
the
Syrian
of
Padanaram,
the
sister
to
Laban
the
Syrian.
025:021
And
Isaac
intreated
the
LORD
for
his
wife,
because
she
was
barren:
and
the
LORD
was
intreated
of
him,
and
Rebekah
his
wife
conceived.
025:022
And
the
children
struggled
together
within
her;
and
she
said,
If
it
be
so,
why
am
I
thus?
And
she
went
to
enquire
of
the
LORD.
025:023
And
the
LORD
said
unto
her,
Two
nations
are
in
thy
womb,
and
two
manner
of
people
shall
be
separated
from
thy
bowels;
and
the
one
people
shall
be
stronger
than
the
other
people;
and
the
elder
shall
serve
the
younger.
025:024
And
when
her
days
to
be
delivered
were
fulfilled,
behold,
there
were
twins
in
her
womb.
025:025
And
the
first
came
out
red,
all
over
like
an
hairy
garment;
and
they
called
his
name
Esau.
025:026
And
after
that
came
his
brother
out,
and
his
hand
took
hold
on
Esau's
heel;
and
his
name
was
called
Jacob:
and
Isaac
was
threescore
years
old
when
she
bare
them.
025:027
And
the
boys
grew:
and
Esau
was
a
cunning
hunter,
a
man
of
the
field;
and
Jacob
was
a
plain
man,
dwelling
in
tents.
025:028
And
Isaac
loved
Esau,
because
he
did
eat
of
his
venison:
but
Rebekah
loved
Jacob.
025:029
And
Jacob
sod
pottage:
and
Esau
came
from
the
field,
and
he
was
faint:
025:030
And
Esau
said
to
Jacob,
Feed
me,
I
pray
thee,
with
that
same
red
pottage;
for
I
am
faint:
therefore
was
his
name
called
Edom.
025:031
And
Jacob
said,
Sell
me
this
day
thy
birthright.
025:032
And
Esau
said,
Behold,
I
am
at
the
point
to
die:
and
what
profit
shall
this
birthright
do
to
me?
025:033
And
Jacob
said,
Swear
to
me
this
day;
and
he
sware
unto
him:
and
he
sold
his
birthright
unto
Jacob.
025:034
Then
Jacob
gave
Esau
bread
and
pottage
of
lentiles;
and
he
did
eat
and
drink,
and
rose
up,
and
went
his
way:
thus
Esau
despised
his
birthright.
026:001
And
there
was
a
famine
in
the
land,
beside
the
first
famine
that
was
in
the
days
of
Abraham.
And
Isaac
went
unto
Abimelech
king
of
the
Philistines
unto
Gerar.
026:002
And
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him,
and
said,
Go
not
down
into
Egypt;
dwell
in
the
land
which
I
shall
tell
thee
of:
026:003
Sojourn
in
this
land,
and
I
will
be
with
thee,
and
will
bless
thee;
for
unto
thee,
and
unto
thy
seed,
I
will
give
all
these
countries,
and
I
will
perform
the
oath
which
I
sware
unto
Abraham
thy
father;
026:004
And
I
will
make
thy
seed
to
multiply
as
the
stars
of
heaven,
and
will
give
unto
thy
seed
all
these
countries;
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed;
026:005
Because
that
Abraham
obeyed
my
voice,
and
kept
my
charge,
my
commandments,
my
statutes,
and
my
laws.
026:006
And
Isaac
dwelt
in
Gerar:
026:007
And
the
men
of
the
place
asked
him
of
his
wife;
and
he
said,
She
is
my
sister:
for
he
feared
to
say,
She
is
my
wife;
lest,
said
he,
the
men
of
the
place
should
kill
me
for
Rebekah;
because
she
was
fair
to
look
upon.
026:008
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
had
been
there
a
long
time,
that
Abimelech
king
of
the
Philistines
looked
out
at
a
window,
and
saw,
and,
behold,
Isaac
was
sporting
with
Rebekah
his
wife.
026:009
And
Abimelech
called
Isaac,
and
said,
Behold,
of
a
surety
she
is
thy
wife;
and
how
saidst
thou,
She
is
my
sister?
And
Isaac
said
unto
him,
Because
I
said,
Lest
I
die
for
her.
026:010
And
Abimelech
said,
What
is
this
thou
hast
done
unto
us?
one
of
the
people
might
lightly
have
lien
with
thy
wife,
and
thou
shouldest
have
brought
guiltiness
upon
us.
026:011
And
Abimelech
charged
all
his
people,
saying,
He
that
toucheth
this
man
or
his
wife
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
026:012
Then
Isaac
sowed
in
that
land,
and
received
in
the
same
year
an
hundredfold:
and
the
LORD
blessed
him.
026:013
And
the
man
waxed
great,
and
went
forward,
and
grew
until
he
became
very
great:
026:014
For
he
had
possession
of
flocks,
and
possession
of
herds,
and
great
store
of
servants:
and
the
Philistines
envied
him.
026:015
For
all
the
wells
which
his
father's
servants
had
digged
in
the
days
of
Abraham
his
father,
the
Philistines
had
stopped
them,
and
filled
them
with
earth.
026:016
And
Abimelech
said
unto
Isaac,
Go
from
us;
for
thou
art
much
mightier
than
we.
026:017
And
Isaac
departed
thence,
and
pitched
his
tent
in
the
valley
of
Gerar,
and
dwelt
there.
026:018
And
Isaac
digged
again
the
wells
of
water,
which
they
had
digged
in
the
days
of
Abraham
his
father;
for
the
Philistines
had
stopped
them
after
the
death
of
Abraham:
and
he
called
their
names
after
the
names
by
which
his
father
had
called
them.
026:019
And
Isaac's
servants
digged
in
the
valley,
and
found
there
a
well
of
springing
water.
026:020
And
the
herdmen
of
Gerar
did
strive
with
Isaac's
herdmen,
saying,
The
water
is
ours:
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
well
Esek;
because
they
strove
with
him.
026:021
And
they
digged
another
well,
and
strove
for
that
also:
and
he
called
the
name
of
it
Sitnah.
026:022
And
he
removed
from
thence,
and
digged
another
well;
and
for
that
they
strove
not:
and
he
called
the
name
of
it
Rehoboth;
and
he
said,
For
now
the
LORD
hath
made
room
for
us,
and
we
shall
be
fruitful
in
the
land.
026:023
And
he
went
up
from
thence
to
Beersheba.
026:024
And
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him
the
same
night,
and
said,
I
am
the
God
of
Abraham
thy
father:
fear
not,
for
I
am
with
thee,
and
will
bless
thee,
and
multiply
thy
seed
for
my
servant
Abraham's
sake.
026:025
And
he
builded
an
altar
there,
and
called
upon
the
name
of
the
LORD,
and
pitched
his
tent
there:
and
there
Isaac's
servants
digged
a
well.
026:026
Then
Abimelech
went
to
him
from
Gerar,
and
Ahuzzath
one
of
his
friends,
and
Phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
army.
026:027
And
Isaac
said
unto
them,
Wherefore
come
ye
to
me,
seeing
ye
hate
me,
and
have
sent
me
away
from
you?
026:028
And
they
said,
We
saw
certainly
that
the
LORD
was
with
thee:
and
we
said,
Let
there
be
now
an
oath
betwixt
us,
even
betwixt
us
and
thee,
and
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
thee;
026:029
That
thou
wilt
do
us
no
hurt,
as
we
have
not
touched
thee,
and
as
we
have
done
unto
thee
nothing
but
good,
and
have
sent
thee
away
in
peace:
thou
art
now
the
blessed
of
the
LORD.
026:030
And
he
made
them
a
feast,
and
they
did
eat
and
drink.
026:031
And
they
rose
up
betimes
in
the
morning,
and
sware
one
to
another:
and
Isaac
sent
them
away,
and
they
departed
from
him
in
peace.
026:032
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
day,
that
Isaac's
servants
came,
and
told
him
concerning
the
well
which
they
had
digged,
and
said
unto
him,
We
have
found
water.
026:033
And
he
called
it
Shebah:
therefore
the
name
of
the
city
is
Beersheba
unto
this
day.
026:034
And
Esau
was
forty
years
old
when
he
took
to
wife
Judith
the
daughter
of
Beeri
the
Hittite,
and
Bashemath
the
daughter
of
Elon
the
Hittite:
026:035
Which
were
a
grief
of
mind
unto
Isaac
and
to
Rebekah.
027:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
Isaac
was
old,
and
his
eyes
were
dim,
so
that
he
could
not
see,
he
called
Esau
his
eldest
son,
and
said
unto
him,
My
son:
and
he
said
unto
him,
Behold,
here
am
I.
027:002
And
he
said,
Behold
now,
I
am
old,
I
know
not
the
day
of
my
death:
027:003
Now
therefore
take,
I
pray
thee,
thy
weapons,
thy
quiver
and
thy
bow,
and
go
out
to
the
field,
and
take
me
some
venison;
027:004
And
make
me
savoury
meat,
such
as
I
love,
and
bring
it
to
me,
that
I
may
eat;
that
my
soul
may
bless
thee
before
I
die.
027:005
And
Rebekah
heard
when
Isaac
spake
to
Esau
his
son.
And
Esau
went
to
the
field
to
hunt
for
venison,
and
to
bring
it.
027:006
And
Rebekah
spake
unto
Jacob
her
son,
saying,
Behold,
I
heard
thy
father
speak
unto
Esau
thy
brother,
saying,
027:007
Bring
me
venison,
and
make
me
savoury
meat,
that
I
may
eat,
and
bless
thee
before
the
LORD
before
my
death.
027:008
Now
therefore,
my
son,
obey
my
voice
according
to
that
which
I
command
thee.
027:009
Go
now
to
the
flock,
and
fetch
me
from
thence
two
good
kids
of
the
goats;
and
I
will
make
them
savoury
meat
for
thy
father,
such
as
he
loveth:
027:010
And
thou
shalt
bring
it
to
thy
father,
that
he
may
eat,
and
that
he
may
bless
thee
before
his
death.
027:011
And
Jacob
said
to
Rebekah
his
mother,
Behold,
Esau
my
brother
is
a
hairy
man,
and
I
am
a
smooth
man:
027:012
My
father
peradventure
will
feel
me,
and
I
shall
seem
to
him
as
a
deceiver;
and
I
shall
bring
a
curse
upon
me,
and
not
a
blessing.
027:013
And
his
mother
said
unto
him,
Upon
me
be
thy
curse,
my
son:
only
obey
my
voice,
and
go
fetch
me
them.
027:014
And
he
went,
and
fetched,
and
brought
them
to
his
mother:
and
his
mother
made
savoury
meat,
such
as
his
father
loved.
027:015
And
Rebekah
took
goodly
raiment
of
her
eldest
son
Esau,
which
were
with
her
in
the
house,
and
put
them
upon
Jacob
her
younger
son:
027:016
And
she
put
the
skins
of
the
kids
of
the
goats
upon
his
hands,
and
upon
the
smooth
of
his
neck:
027:017
And
she
gave
the
savoury
meat
and
the
bread,
which
she
had
prepared,
into
the
hand
of
her
son
Jacob.
027:018
And
he
came
unto
his
father,
and
said,
My
father:
and
he
said,
Here
am
I;
who
art
thou,
my
son?
027:019
And
Jacob
said
unto
his
father,
I
am
Esau
thy
first
born;
I
have
done
according
as
thou
badest
me:
arise,
I
pray
thee,
sit
and
eat
of
my
venison,
that
thy
soul
may
bless
me.
027:020
And
Isaac
said
unto
his
son,
How
is
it
that
thou
hast
found
it
so
quickly,
my
son?
And
he
said,
Because
the
LORD
thy
God
brought
it
to
me.
027:021
And
Isaac
said
unto
Jacob,
Come
near,
I
pray
thee,
that
I
may
feel
thee,
my
son,
whether
thou
be
my
very
son
Esau
or
not.
027:022
And
Jacob
went
near
unto
Isaac
his
father;
and
he
felt
him,
and
said,
The
voice
is
Jacob's
voice,
but
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
Esau.
027:023
And
he
discerned
him
not,
because
his
hands
were
hairy,
as
his
brother
Esau's
hands:
so
he
blessed
him.
027:024
And
he
said,
Art
thou
my
very
son
Esau?
And
he
said,
I
am.
027:025
And
he
said,
Bring
it
near
to
me,
and
I
will
eat
of
my
son's
venison,
that
my
soul
may
bless
thee.
And
he
brought
it
near
to
him,
and
he
did
eat:
and
he
brought
him
wine
and
he
drank.
027:026
And
his
father
Isaac
said
unto
him,
Come
near
now,
and
kiss
me,
my
son.
027:027
And
he
came
near,
and
kissed
him:
and
he
smelled
the
smell
of
his
raiment,
and
blessed
him,
and
said,
See,
the
smell
of
my
son
is
as
the
smell
of
a
field
which
the
LORD
hath
blessed:
027:028
Therefore
God
give
thee
of
the
dew
of
heaven,
and
the
fatness
of
the
earth,
and
plenty
of
corn
and
wine:
027:029
Let
people
serve
thee,
and
nations
bow
down
to
thee:
be
lord
over
thy
brethren,
and
let
thy
mother's
sons
bow
down
to
thee:
cursed
be
every
one
that
curseth
thee,
and
blessed
be
he
that
blesseth
thee.
027:030
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
soon
as
Isaac
had
made
an
end
of
blessing
Jacob,
and
Jacob
was
yet
scarce
gone
out
from
the
presence
of
Isaac
his
father,
that
Esau
his
brother
came
in
from
his
hunting.
027:031
And
he
also
had
made
savoury
meat,
and
brought
it
unto
his
father,
and
said
unto
his
father,
Let
my
father
arise,
and
eat
of
his
son's
venison,
that
thy
soul
may
bless
me.
027:032
And
Isaac
his
father
said
unto
him,
Who
art
thou?
And
he
said,
I
am
thy
son,
thy
firstborn
Esau.
027:033
And
Isaac
trembled
very
exceedingly,
and
said,
Who?
where
is
he
that
hath
taken
venison,
and
brought
it
me,
and
I
have
eaten
of
all
before
thou
camest,
and
have
blessed
him?
yea,
and
he
shall
be
blessed.
027:034
And
when
Esau
heard
the
words
of
his
father,
he
cried
with
a
great
and
exceeding
bitter
cry,
and
said
unto
his
father,
Bless
me,
even
me
also,
O
my
father.
027:035
And
he
said,
Thy
brother
came
with
subtilty,
and
hath
taken
away
thy
blessing.
027:036
And
he
said,
Is
not
he
rightly
named
Jacob?
for
he
hath
supplanted
me
these
two
times:
he
took
away
my
birthright;
and,
behold,
now
he
hath
taken
away
my
blessing.
And
he
said,
Hast
thou
not
reserved
a
blessing
for
me?
027:037
And
Isaac
answered
and
said
unto
Esau,
Behold,
I
have
made
him
thy
lord,
and
all
his
brethren
have
I
given
to
him
for
servants;
and
with
corn
and
wine
have
I
sustained
him:
and
what
shall
I
do
now
unto
thee,
my
son?
027:038
And
Esau
said
unto
his
father,
Hast
thou
but
one
blessing,
my
father?
bless
me,
even
me
also,
O
my
father.
And
Esau
lifted
up
his
voice,
and
wept.
027:039
And
Isaac
his
father
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thy
dwelling
shall
be
the
fatness
of
the
earth,
and
of
the
dew
of
heaven
from
above;
027:040
And
by
thy
sword
shalt
thou
live,
and
shalt
serve
thy
brother;
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
thou
shalt
have
the
dominion,
that
thou
shalt
break
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck.
027:041
And
Esau
hated
Jacob
because
of
the
blessing
wherewith
his
father
blessed
him:
and
Esau
said
in
his
heart,
The
days
of
mourning
for
my
father
are
at
hand;
then
will
I
slay
my
brother
Jacob.
027:042
And
these
words
of
Esau
her
elder
son
were
told
to
Rebekah:
and
she
sent
and
called
Jacob
her
younger
son,
and
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thy
brother
Esau,
as
touching
thee,
doth
comfort
himself,
purposing
to
kill
thee.
027:043
Now
therefore,
my
son,
obey
my
voice;
arise,
flee
thou
to
Laban
my
brother
to
Haran;
027:044
And
tarry
with
him
a
few
days,
until
thy
brother's
fury
turn
away;
027:045
Until
thy
brother's
anger
turn
away
from
thee,
and
he
forget
that
which
thou
hast
done
to
him:
then
I
will
send,
and
fetch
thee
from
thence:
why
should
I
be
deprived
also
of
you
both
in
one
day?
027:046
And
Rebekah
said
to
Isaac,
I
am
weary
of
my
life
because
of
the
daughters
of
Heth:
if
Jacob
take
a
wife
of
the
daughters
of
Heth,
such
as
these
which
are
of
the
daughters
of
the
land,
what
good
shall
my
life
do
me?
028:001
And
Isaac
called
Jacob,
and
blessed
him,
and
charged
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
of
the
daughters
of
Canaan.
028:002
Arise,
go
to
Padanaram,
to
the
house
of
Bethuel
thy
mother's
father;
and
take
thee
a
wife
from
thence
of
the
daughers
of
Laban
thy
mother's
brother.
028:003
And
God
Almighty
bless
thee,
and
make
thee
fruitful,
and
multiply
thee,
that
thou
mayest
be
a
multitude
of
people;
028:004
And
give
thee
the
blessing
of
Abraham,
to
thee,
and
to
thy
seed
with
thee;
that
thou
mayest
inherit
the
land
wherein
thou
art
a
stranger,
which
God
gave
unto
Abraham.
028:005
And
Isaac
sent
away
Jacob:
and
he
went
to
Padanaram
unto
Laban,
son
of
Bethuel
the
Syrian,
the
brother
of
Rebekah,
Jacob's
and
Esau's
mother.
028:006
When
Esau
saw
that
Isaac
had
blessed
Jacob,
and
sent
him
away
to
Padanaram,
to
take
him
a
wife
from
thence;
and
that
as
he
blessed
him
he
gave
him
a
charge,
saying,
Thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
of
the
daughers
of
Canaan;
028:007
And
that
Jacob
obeyed
his
father
and
his
mother,
and
was
gone
to
Padanaram;
028:008
And
Esau
seeing
that
the
daughters
of
Canaan
pleased
not
Isaac
his
father;
028:009
Then
went
Esau
unto
Ishmael,
and
took
unto
the
wives
which
he
had
Mahalath
the
daughter
of
Ishmael
Abraham's
son,
the
sister
of
Nebajoth,
to
be
his
wife.
028:010
And
Jacob
went
out
from
Beersheba,
and
went
toward
Haran.
028:011
And
he
lighted
upon
a
certain
place,
and
tarried
there
all
night,
because
the
sun
was
set;
and
he
took
of
the
stones
of
that
place,
and
put
them
for
his
pillows,
and
lay
down
in
that
place
to
sleep.
028:012
And
he
dreamed,
and
behold
a
ladder
set
up
on
the
earth,
and
the
top
of
it
reached
to
heaven:
and
behold
the
angels
of
God
ascending
and
descending
on
it.
028:013
And,
behold,
the
LORD
stood
above
it,
and
said,
I
am
the
LORD
God
of
Abraham
thy
father,
and
the
God
of
Isaac:
the
land
whereon
thou
liest,
to
thee
will
I
give
it,
and
to
thy
seed;
028:014
And
thy
seed
shall
be
as
the
dust
of
the
earth,
and
thou
shalt
spread
abroad
to
the
west,
and
to
the
east,
and
to
the
north,
and
to
the
south:
and
in
thee
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
families
of
the
earth
be
blessed.
028:015
And,
behold,
I
am
with
thee,
and
will
keep
thee
in
all
places
whither
thou
goest,
and
will
bring
thee
again
into
this
land;
for
I
will
not
leave
thee,
until
I
have
done
that
which
I
have
spoken
to
thee
of.
028:016
And
Jacob
awaked
out
of
his
sleep,
and
he
said,
Surely
the
LORD
is
in
this
place;
and
I
knew
it
not.
028:017
And
he
was
afraid,
and
said,
How
dreadful
