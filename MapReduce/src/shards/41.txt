of
Achor,
unto
this
day.
008:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Joshua,
Fear
not,
neither
be
thou
dismayed:
take
all
the
people
of
war
with
thee,
and
arise,
go
up
to
Ai:
see,
I
have
given
into
thy
hand
the
king
of
Ai,
and
his
people,
and
his
city,
and
his
land:
008:002
And
thou
shalt
do
to
Ai
and
her
king
as
thou
didst
unto
Jericho
and
her
king:
only
the
spoil
thereof,
and
the
cattle
thereof,
shall
ye
take
for
a
prey
unto
yourselves:
lay
thee
an
ambush
for
the
city
behind
it.
008:003
So
Joshua
arose,
and
all
the
people
of
war,
to
go
up
against
Ai:
and
Joshua
chose
out
thirty
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour,
and
sent
them
away
by
night.
008:004
And
he
commanded
them,
saying,
Behold,
ye
shall
lie
in
wait
against
the
city,
even
behind
the
city:
go
not
very
far
from
the
city,
but
be
ye
all
ready:
008:005
And
I,
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
me,
will
approach
unto
the
city:
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
they
come
out
against
us,
as
at
the
first,
that
we
will
flee
before
them,
008:006
(For
they
will
come
out
after
us)
till
we
have
drawn
them
from
the
city;
for
they
will
say,
They
flee
before
us,
as
at
the
first:
therefore
we
will
flee
before
them.
008:007
Then
ye
shall
rise
up
from
the
ambush,
and
seize
upon
the
city:
for
the
LORD
your
God
will
deliver
it
into
your
hand.
008:008
And
it
shall
be,
when
ye
have
taken
the
city,
that
ye
shall
set
the
city
on
fire:
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
shall
ye
do.
See,
I
have
commanded
you.
008:009
Joshua
therefore
sent
them
forth:
and
they
went
to
lie
in
ambush,
and
abode
between
Bethel
and
Ai,
on
the
west
side
of
Ai:
but
Joshua
lodged
that
night
among
the
people.
008:010
And
Joshua
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
numbered
the
people,
and
went
up,
he
and
the
elders
of
Israel,
before
the
people
to
Ai.
008:011
And
all
the
people,
even
the
people
of
war
that
were
with
him,
went
up,
and
drew
nigh,
and
came
before
the
city,
and
pitched
on
the
north
side
of
Ai:
now
there
was
a
valley
between
them
and
Ai.
008:012
And
he
took
about
five
thousand
men,
and
set
them
to
lie
in
ambush
between
Bethel
and
Ai,
on
the
west
side
of
the
city.
008:013
And
when
they
had
set
the
people,
even
all
the
host
that
was
on
the
north
of
the
city,
and
their
liers
in
wait
on
the
west
of
the
city,
Joshua
went
that
night
into
the
midst
of
the
valley.
008:014
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
king
of
Ai
saw
it,
that
they
hasted
and
rose
up
early,
and
the
men
of
the
city
went
out
against
Israel
to
battle,
he
and
all
his
people,
at
a
time
appointed,
before
the
plain;
but
he
wist
not
that
there
were
liers
in
ambush
against
him
behind
the
city.
008:015
And
Joshua
and
all
Israel
made
as
if
they
were
beaten
before
them,
and
fled
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness.
008:016
And
all
the
people
that
were
in
Ai
were
called
together
to
pursue
after
them:
and
they
pursued
after
Joshua,
and
were
drawn
away
from
the
city.
008:017
And
there
was
not
a
man
left
in
Ai
or
Bethel,
that
went
not
out
after
Israel:
and
they
left
the
city
open,
and
pursued
after
Israel.
008:018
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Joshua,
Stretch
out
the
spear
that
is
in
thy
hand
toward
Ai;
for
I
will
give
it
into
thine
hand.
And
Joshua
stretched
out
the
spear
that
he
had
in
his
hand
toward
the
city.
008:019
And
the
ambush
arose
quickly
out
of
their
place,
and
they
ran
as
soon
as
he
had
stretched
out
his
hand:
and
they
entered
into
the
city,
and
took
it,
and
hasted
and
set
the
city
on
fire.
008:020
And
when
the
men
of
Ai
looked
behind
them,
they
saw,
and,
behold,
the
smoke
of
the
city
ascended
up
to
heaven,
and
they
had
no
power
to
flee
this
way
or
that
way:
and
the
people
that
fled
to
the
wilderness
turned
back
upon
the
pursuers.
008:021
And
when
Joshua
and
all
Israel
saw
that
the
ambush
had
taken
the
city,
and
that
the
smoke
of
the
city
ascended,
then
they
turned
again,
and
slew
the
men
of
Ai.
008:022
And
the
other
issued
out
of
the
city
against
them;
so
they
were
in
the
midst
of
Israel,
some
on
this
side,
and
some
on
that
side:
and
they
smote
them,
so
that
they
let
none
of
them
remain
or
escape.
008:023
And
the
king
of
Ai
they
took
alive,
and
brought
him
to
Joshua.
008:024
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Israel
had
made
an
end
of
slaying
all
the
inhabitants
of
Ai
in
the
field,
in
the
wilderness
wherein
they
chased
them,
and
when
they
were
all
fallen
on
the
edge
of
the
sword,
until
they
were
consumed,
that
all
the
Israelites
returned
unto
Ai,
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword.
008:025
And
so
it
was,
that
all
that
fell
that
day,
both
of
men
and
women,
were
twelve
thousand,
even
all
the
men
of
Ai.
008:026
For
Joshua
drew
not
his
hand
back,
wherewith
he
stretched
out
the
spear,
until
he
had
utterly
destroyed
all
the
inhabitants
of
Ai.
008:027
Only
the
cattle
and
the
spoil
of
that
city
Israel
took
for
a
prey
unto
themselves,
according
unto
the
word
of
the
LORD
which
he
commanded
Joshua.
008:028
And
Joshua
burnt
Ai,
and
made
it
an
heap
for
ever,
even
a
desolation
unto
this
day.
008:029
And
the
king
of
Ai
he
hanged
on
a
tree
until
eventide:
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
down,
Joshua
commanded
that
they
should
take
his
carcase
down
from
the
tree,
and
cast
it
at
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city,
and
raise
thereon
a
great
heap
of
stones,
that
remaineth
unto
this
day.
008:030
Then
Joshua
built
an
altar
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
in
mount
Ebal,
008:031
As
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
commanded
the
children
of
Israel,
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
Moses,
an
altar
of
whole
stones,
over
which
no
man
hath
lift
up
any
iron:
and
they
offered
thereon
burnt
offerings
unto
the
LORD,
and
sacrificed
peace
offerings.
008:032
And
he
wrote
there
upon
the
stones
a
copy
of
the
law
of
Moses,
which
he
wrote
in
the
presence
of
the
children
of
Israel.
008:033
And
all
Israel,
and
their
elders,
and
officers,
and
their
judges,
stood
on
this
side
the
ark
and
on
that
side
before
the
priests
the
Levites,
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
as
well
the
stranger,
as
he
that
was
born
among
them;
half
of
them
over
against
mount
Gerizim,
and
half
of
them
over
against
mount
Ebal;
as
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
had
commanded
before,
that
they
should
bless
the
people
of
Israel.
008:034
And
afterward
he
read
all
the
words
of
the
law,
the
blessings
and
cursings,
according
to
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law.
008:035
There
was
not
a
word
of
all
that
Moses
commanded,
which
Joshua
read
not
before
all
the
congregation
of
Israel,
with
the
women,
and
the
little
ones,
and
the
strangers
that
were
conversant
among
them.
009:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
all
the
kings
which
were
on
this
side
Jordan,
in
the
hills,
and
in
the
valleys,
and
in
all
the
coasts
of
the
great
sea
over
against
Lebanon,
the
Hittite,
and
the
Amorite,
the
Canaanite,
the
Perizzite,
the
Hivite,
and
the
Jebusite,
heard
thereof;
009:002
That
they
gathered
themselves
together,
to
fight
with
Joshua
and
with
Israel,
with
one
accord.
009:003
And
when
the
inhabitants
of
Gibeon
heard
what
Joshua
had
done
unto
Jericho
and
to
Ai,
009:004
They
did
work
wilily,
and
went
and
made
as
if
they
had
been
ambassadors,
and
took
old
sacks
upon
their
asses,
and
wine
bottles,
old,
and
rent,
and
bound
up;
009:005
And
old
shoes
and
clouted
upon
their
feet,
and
old
garments
upon
them;
and
all
the
bread
of
their
provision
was
dry
and
mouldy.
009:006
And
they
went
to
Joshua
unto
the
camp
at
Gilgal,
and
said
unto
him,
and
to
the
men
of
Israel,
We
be
come
from
a
far
country:
now
therefore
make
ye
a
league
with
us.
009:007
And
the
men
of
Israel
said
unto
the
Hivites,
Peradventure
ye
dwell
among
us;
and
how
shall
we
make
a
league
with
you?
009:008
And
they
said
unto
Joshua,
We
are
thy
servants.
And
Joshua
said
unto
them,
Who
are
ye?
and
from
whence
come
ye?
009:009
And
they
said
unto
him,
From
a
very
far
country
thy
servants
are
come
because
of
the
name
of
the
LORD
thy
God:
for
we
have
heard
the
fame
of
him,
and
all
that
he
did
in
Egypt,
009:010
And
all
that
he
did
to
the
two
kings
of
the
Amorites,
that
were
beyond
Jordan,
to
Sihon
king
of
Heshbon,
and
to
Og
king
of
Bashan,
which
was
at
Ashtaroth.
009:011
Wherefore
our
elders
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
our
country
spake
to
us,
saying,
Take
victuals
with
you
for
the
journey,
and
go
to
meet
them,
and
say
unto
them,
We
are
your
servants:
therefore
now
make
ye
a
league
with
us.
009:012
This
our
bread
we
took
hot
for
our
provision
out
of
our
houses
on
the
day
we
came
forth
to
go
unto
you;
but
now,
behold,
it
is
dry,
and
it
is
mouldy:
009:013
And
these
bottles
of
wine,
which
we
filled,
were
new;
and,
behold,
they
be
rent:
and
these
our
garments
and
our
shoes
are
become
old
by
reason
of
the
very
long
journey.
009:014
And
the
men
took
of
their
victuals,
and
asked
not
counsel
at
the
mouth
of
the
LORD.
009:015
And
Joshua
made
peace
with
them,
and
made
a
league
with
them,
to
let
them
live:
and
the
princes
of
the
congregation
sware
unto
them.
009:016
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
three
days
after
they
had
made
a
league
with
them,
that
they
heard
that
they
were
their
neighbours,
and
that
they
dwelt
among
them.
009:017
And
the
children
of
Israel
journeyed,
and
came
unto
their
cities
on
the
third
day.
Now
their
cities
were
Gibeon,
and
Chephirah,
and
Beeroth,
and
Kirjathjearim.
009:018
And
the
children
of
Israel
smote
them
not,
because
the
princes
of
the
congregation
had
sworn
unto
them
by
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
And
all
the
congregation
murmured
against
the
princes.
009:019
But
all
the
princes
said
unto
all
the
congregation,
We
have
sworn
unto
them
by
the
LORD
God
of
Israel:
now
therefore
we
may
not
touch
them.
009:020
This
we
will
do
to
them;
we
will
even
let
them
live,
lest
wrath
be
upon
us,
because
of
the
oath
which
we
sware
unto
them.
009:021
And
the
princes
said
unto
them,
Let
them
live;
but
let
them
be
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
unto
all
the
congregation;
as
the
princes
had
promised
them.
009:022
And
Joshua
called
for
them,
and
he
spake
unto
them,
saying,
Wherefore
have
ye
beguiled
us,
saying,
We
are
very
far
from
you;
when
ye
dwell
among
us?
009:023
Now
therefore
ye
are
cursed,
and
there
shall
none
of
you
be
freed
from
being
bondmen,
and
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
house
of
my
God.
009:024
And
they
answered
Joshua,
and
said,
Because
it
was
certainly
told
thy
servants,
how
that
the
LORD
thy
God
commanded
his
servant
Moses
to
give
you
all
the
land,
and
to
destroy
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
from
before
you,
therefore
we
were
sore
afraid
of
our
lives
because
of
you,
and
have
done
this
thing.
009:025
And
now,
behold,
we
are
in
thine
hand:
as
it
seemeth
good
and
right
unto
thee
to
do
unto
us,
do.
009:026
And
so
did
he
unto
them,
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
children
of
Israel,
that
they
slew
them
not.
009:027
And
Joshua
made
them
that
day
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
congregation,
and
for
the
altar
of
the
LORD,
even
unto
this
day,
in
the
place
which
he
should
choose.
010:001
Now
it
came
to
pass,
when
Adonizedec
king
of
Jerusalem
had
heard
how
Joshua
had
taken
Ai,
and
had
utterly
destroyed
it;
as
he
had
done
to
Jericho
and
her
king,
so
he
had
done
to
Ai
and
her
king;
and
how
the
inhabitants
of
Gibeon
had
made
peace
with
Israel,
and
were
among
them;
010:002
That
they
feared
greatly,
because
Gibeon
was
a
great
city,
as
one
of
the
royal
cities,
and
because
it
was
greater
than
Ai,
and
all
the
men
thereof
were
mighty.
010:003
Wherefore
Adonizedec
king
of
Jerusalem,
sent
unto
Hoham
king
of
Hebron,
and
unto
Piram
king
of
Jarmuth,
and
unto
Japhia
king
of
Lachish,
and
unto
Debir
king
of
Eglon,
saying,
010:004
Come
up
unto
me,
and
help
me,
that
we
may
smite
Gibeon:
for
it
hath
made
peace
with
Joshua
and
with
the
children
of
Israel.
010:005
Therefore
the
five
kings
of
the
Amorites,
the
king
of
Jerusalem,
the
king
of
Hebron,
the
king
of
Jarmuth,
the
king
of
Lachish,
the
king
of
Eglon,
gathered
themselves
together,
and
went
up,
they
and
all
their
hosts,
and
encamped
before
Gibeon,
and
made
war
against
it.
010:006
And
the
men
of
Gibeon
sent
unto
Joshua
to
the
camp
to
Gilgal,
saying,
Slack
not
thy
hand
from
thy
servants;
come
up
to
us
quickly,
and
save
us,
and
help
us:
for
all
the
kings
of
the
Amorites
that
dwell
in
the
mountains
are
gathered
together
against
us.
010:007
So
Joshua
ascended
from
Gilgal,
he,
and
all
the
people
of
war
with
him,
and
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour.
010:008
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Joshua,
Fear
them
not:
for
I
have
delivered
them
into
thine
hand;
there
shall
not
a
man
of
them
stand
before
thee.
010:009
Joshua
therefore
came
unto
them
suddenly,
and
went
up
from
Gilgal
all
night.
010:010
And
the
LORD
discomfited
them
before
Israel,
and
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
at
Gibeon,
and
chased
them
along
the
way
that
goeth
up
to
Bethhoron,
and
smote
them
to
Azekah,
and
unto
Makkedah.
010:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
fled
from
before
Israel,
and
were
in
the
going
down
to
Bethhoron,
that
the
LORD
cast
down
great
stones
from
heaven
upon
them
unto
Azekah,
and
they
died:
they
were
more
which
died
with
hailstones
than
they
whom
the
children
of
Israel
slew
with
the
sword.
010:012
Then
spake
Joshua
to
the
LORD
in
the
day
when
the
LORD
delivered
up
the
Amorites
before
the
children
of
Israel,
and
he
said
in
the
sight
of
Israel,
Sun,
stand
thou
still
upon
Gibeon;
and
thou,
Moon,
in
the
valley
of
Ajalon.
010:013
And
the
sun
stood
still,
and
the
moon
stayed,
until
the
people
had
avenged
themselves
upon
their
enemies.
Is
not
this
written
in
the
book
of
Jasher?
So
the
sun
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
heaven,
and
hasted
not
to
go
down
about
a
whole
day.
010:014
And
there
was
no
day
like
that
before
it
or
after
it,
that
the
LORD
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
a
man:
for
the
LORD
fought
for
Israel.
010:015
And
Joshua
returned,
and
all
Israel
with
him,
unto
the
camp
to
Gilgal.
010:016
But
these
five
kings
fled,
and
hid
themselves
in
a
cave
at
Makkedah.
010:017
And
it
was
told
Joshua,
saying,
The
five
kings
are
found
hid
in
a
cave
at
Makkedah.
010:018
And
Joshua
said,
Roll
great
stones
upon
the
mouth
of
the
cave,
and
set
men
by
it
for
to
keep
them:
010:019
And
stay
ye
not,
but
pursue
after
your
enemies,
and
smite
the
hindmost
of
them;
suffer
them
not
to
enter
into
their
cities:
for
the
LORD
your
God
hath
delivered
them
into
your
hand.
010:020
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Joshua
and
the
children
of
Israel
had
made
an
end
of
slaying
them
with
a
very
great
slaughter,
till
they
were
consumed,
that
the
rest
which
remained
of
them
entered
into
fenced
cities.
010:021
And
all
the
people
returned
to
the
camp
to
Joshua
at
Makkedah
in
peace:
none
moved
his
tongue
against
any
of
the
children
of
Israel.
010:022
Then
said
Joshua,
Open
the
mouth
of
the
cave,
and
bring
out
those
five
kings
unto
me
out
of
the
cave.
010:023
And
they
did
so,
and
brought
forth
those
five
kings
unto
him
out
of
the
cave,
the
king
of
Jerusalem,
the
king
of
Hebron,
the
king
of
Jarmuth,
the
king
of
Lachish,
and
the
king
of
Eglon.
010:024
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
brought
out
those
kings
unto
Joshua,
that
Joshua
called
for
all
the
men
of
Israel,
and
said
unto
the
captains
of
the
men
of
war
which
went
with
him,
Come
near,
put
your
feet
upon
the
necks
of
these
kings.
And
they
came
near,
and
put
their
feet
upon
the
necks
of
them.
010:025
And
Joshua
said
unto
them,
Fear
not,
nor
be
dismayed,
be
strong
and
of
good
courage:
for
thus
shall
the
LORD
do
to
all
your
enemies
against
whom
ye
fight.
010:026
And
afterward
Joshua
smote
them,
and
slew
them,
and
hanged
them
on
five
trees:
and
they
were
hanging
upon
the
trees
until
the
evening.
010:027
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
of
the
going
down
of
the
sun,
that
Joshua
commanded,
and
they
took
them
down
off
the
trees,
and
cast
them
into
the
cave
wherein
they
had
been
hid,
and
laid
great
stones
in
the
cave's
mouth,
which
remain
until
this
very
day.
010:028
And
that
day
Joshua
took
Makkedah,
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
the
king
thereof
he
utterly
destroyed,
them,
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein;
he
let
none
remain:
and
he
did
to
the
king
of
Makkedah
as
he
did
unto
the
king
of
Jericho.
010:029
Then
Joshua
passed
from
Makkedah,
and
all
Israel
with
him,
unto
Libnah,
and
fought
against
Libnah:
010:030
And
the
LORD
delivered
it
also,
and
the
king
thereof,
into
the
hand
of
Israel;
and
he
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein;
he
let
none
remain
in
it;
but
did
unto
the
king
thereof
as
he
did
unto
the
king
of
Jericho.
010:031
And
Joshua
passed
from
Libnah,
and
all
Israel
with
him,
unto
Lachish,
and
encamped
against
it,
and
fought
against
it:
010:032
And
the
LORD
delivered
Lachish
into
the
hand
of
Israel,
which
took
it
on
the
second
day,
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein,
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
Libnah.
010:033
Then
Horam
king
of
Gezer
came
up
to
help
Lachish;
and
Joshua
smote
him
and
his
people,
until
he
had
left
him
none
remaining.
010:034
And
from
Lachish
Joshua
passed
unto
Eglon,
and
all
Israel
with
him;
and
they
encamped
against
it,
and
fought
against
it:
010:035
And
they
took
it
on
that
day,
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
utterly
destroyed
that
day,
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
Lachish.
010:036
And
Joshua
went
up
from
Eglon,
and
all
Israel
with
him,
unto
Hebron;
and
they
fought
against
it:
010:037
And
they
took
it,
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
the
king
thereof,
and
all
the
cities
thereof,
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein;
he
left
none
remaining,
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
Eglon;
but
destroyed
it
utterly,
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein.
010:038
And
Joshua
returned,
and
all
Israel
with
him,
to
Debir;
and
fought
against
it:
010:039
And
he
took
it,
and
the
king
thereof,
and
all
the
cities
thereof;
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
souls
that
were
therein;
he
left
none
remaining:
as
he
had
done
to
Hebron,
so
he
did
to
Debir,
and
to
the
king
thereof;
as
he
had
done
also
to
Libnah,
and
to
her
king.
010:040
So
Joshua
smote
all
the
country
of
the
hills,
and
of
the
south,
and
of
the
vale,
and
of
the
springs,
and
all
their
kings:
he
left
none
remaining,
but
utterly
destroyed
all
that
breathed,
as
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
commanded.
010:041
And
Joshua
smote
them
from
Kadeshbarnea
even
unto
Gaza,
and
all
the
country
of
Goshen,
even
unto
Gibeon.
010:042
And
all
these
kings
and
their
land
did
Joshua
take
at
one
time,
because
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
fought
for
Israel.
010:043
And
Joshua
returned,
and
all
Israel
with
him,
unto
the
camp
to
Gilgal.
011:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Jabin
king
of
Hazor
had
heard
those
things,
that
he
sent
to
Jobab
king
of
Madon,
and
to
the
king
of
Shimron,
and
to
the
king
of
Achshaph,
011:002
And
to
the
kings
that
were
on
the
north
of
the
mountains,
and
of
the
plains
south
of
Chinneroth,
and
in
the
valley,
and
in
the
borders
of
Dor
on
the
west,
011:003
And
to
the
Canaanite
on
the
east
and
on
the
west,
and
to
the
Amorite,
and
the
Hittite,
and
the
Perizzite,
and
the
Jebusite
in
the
mountains,
and
to
the
Hivite
under
Hermon
in
the
land
of
Mizpeh.
011:004
And
they
went
out,
they
and
all
their
hosts
with
them,
much
people,
even
as
the
sand
that
is
upon
the
sea
shore
in
multitude,
with
horses
and
chariots
very
many.
011:005
And
when
all
these
kings
were
met
together,
they
came
and
pitched
together
at
the
waters
of
Merom,
to
fight
against
Israel.
011:006
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Joshua,
Be
not
afraid
because
of
them:
for
to
morrow
about
this
time
will
I
deliver
them
up
all
slain
before
Israel:
thou
shalt
hough
their
horses,
and
burn
their
chariots
with
fire.
011:007
So
Joshua
came,
and
all
the
people
of
war
with
him,
against
them
by
the
waters
of
Merom
suddenly;
and
they
fell
upon
them.
011:008
And
the
LORD
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
Israel,
who
smote
them,
and
chased
them
unto
great
Zidon,
and
unto
Misrephothmaim,
and
unto
the
valley
of
Mizpeh
eastward;
and
they
smote
them,
until
they
left
them
none
remaining.
011:009
And
Joshua
did
unto
them
as
the
LORD
bade
him:
he
houghed
their
horses,
and
burnt
their
chariots
with
fire.
011:010
And
Joshua
at
that
time
turned
back,
and
took
Hazor,
and
smote
the
king
thereof
with
the
sword:
for
Hazor
beforetime
was
the
head
of
all
those
kingdoms.
011:011
And
they
smote
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
utterly
destroying
them:
there
was
not
any
left
to
breathe:
and
he
burnt
Hazor
with
fire.
011:012
And
all
the
cities
of
those
kings,
and
all
the
kings
of
them,
did
Joshua
take,
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
he
utterly
destroyed
them,
as
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
commanded.
011:013
But
as
for
the
cities
that
stood
still
in
their
strength,
Israel
burned
none
of
them,
save
Hazor
only;
that
did
Joshua
burn.
011:014
And
all
the
spoil
of
these
cities,
and
the
cattle,
the
children
of
Israel
took
for
a
prey
unto
themselves;
but
every
man
they
smote
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
until
they
had
destroyed
them,
neither
left
they
any
to
breathe.
011:015
As
the
LORD
commanded
Moses
his
servant,
so
did
Moses
command
Joshua,
and
so
did
Joshua;
he
left
nothing
undone
of
all
that
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
011:016
So
Joshua
took
all
that
land,
the
hills,
and
all
the
south
country,
and
all
the
land
of
Goshen,
and
the
valley,
and
the
plain,
and
the
mountain
of
Israel,
and
the
valley
of
the
same;
011:017
Even
from
the
mount
Halak,
that
goeth
up
to
Seir,
even
unto
Baalgad
in
the
valley
of
Lebanon
under
mount
Hermon:
and
all
their
kings
he
took,
and
smote
them,
and
slew
them.
011:018
Joshua
made
war
a
long
time
with
all
those
kings.
011:019
There
was
not
a
city
that
made
