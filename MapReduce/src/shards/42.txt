peace
with
the
children
of
Israel,
save
the
Hivites
the
inhabitants
of
Gibeon:
all
other
they
took
in
battle.
011:020
For
it
was
of
the
LORD
to
harden
their
hearts,
that
they
should
come
against
Israel
in
battle,
that
he
might
destroy
them
utterly,
and
that
they
might
have
no
favour,
but
that
he
might
destroy
them,
as
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
011:021
And
at
that
time
came
Joshua,
and
cut
off
the
Anakims
from
the
mountains,
from
Hebron,
from
Debir,
from
Anab,
and
from
all
the
mountains
of
Judah,
and
from
all
the
mountains
of
Israel:
Joshua
destroyed
them
utterly
with
their
cities.
011:022
There
was
none
of
the
Anakims
left
in
the
land
of
the
children
of
Israel:
only
in
Gaza,
in
Gath,
and
in
Ashdod,
there
remained.
011:023
So
Joshua
took
the
whole
land,
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses;
and
Joshua
gave
it
for
an
inheritance
unto
Israel
according
to
their
divisions
by
their
tribes.
And
the
land
rested
from
war.
012:001
Now
these
are
the
kings
of
the
land,
which
the
children
of
Israel
smote,
and
possessed
their
land
on
the
other
side
Jordan
toward
the
rising
of
the
sun,
from
the
river
Arnon
unto
mount
Hermon,
and
all
the
plain
on
the
east:
012:002
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
who
dwelt
in
Heshbon,
and
ruled
from
Aroer,
which
is
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
Arnon,
and
from
the
middle
of
the
river,
and
from
half
Gilead,
even
unto
the
river
Jabbok,
which
is
the
border
of
the
children
of
Ammon;
012:003
And
from
the
plain
to
the
sea
of
Chinneroth
on
the
east,
and
unto
the
sea
of
the
plain,
even
the
salt
sea
on
the
east,
the
way
to
Bethjeshimoth;
and
from
the
south,
under
Ashdothpisgah:
012:004
And
the
coast
of
Og
king
of
Bashan,
which
was
of
the
remnant
of
the
giants,
that
dwelt
at
Ashtaroth
and
at
Edrei,
012:005
And
reigned
in
mount
Hermon,
and
in
Salcah,
and
in
all
Bashan,
unto
the
border
of
the
Geshurites
and
the
Maachathites,
and
half
Gilead,
the
border
of
Sihon
king
of
Heshbon.
012:006
Them
did
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
and
the
children
of
Israel
smite:
and
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
gave
it
for
a
possession
unto
the
Reubenites,
and
the
Gadites,
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh.
012:007
And
these
are
the
kings
of
the
country
which
Joshua
and
the
children
of
Israel
smote
on
this
side
Jordan
on
the
west,
from
Baalgad
in
the
valley
of
Lebanon
even
unto
the
mount
Halak,
that
goeth
up
to
Seir;
which
Joshua
gave
unto
the
tribes
of
Israel
for
a
possession
according
to
their
divisions;
012:008
In
the
mountains,
and
in
the
valleys,
and
in
the
plains,
and
in
the
springs,
and
in
the
wilderness,
and
in
the
south
country;
the
Hittites,
the
Amorites,
and
the
Canaanites,
the
Perizzites,
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites:
012:009
The
king
of
Jericho,
one;
the
king
of
Ai,
which
is
beside
Bethel,
one;
012:010
The
king
of
Jerusalem,
one;
the
king
of
Hebron,
one;
012:011
The
king
of
Jarmuth,
one;
the
king
of
Lachish,
one;
012:012
The
king
of
Eglon,
one;
the
king
of
Gezer,
one;
012:013
The
king
of
Debir,
one;
the
king
of
Geder,
one;
012:014
The
king
of
Hormah,
one;
the
king
of
Arad,
one;
012:015
The
king
of
Libnah,
one;
the
king
of
Adullam,
one;
012:016
The
king
of
Makkedah,
one;
the
king
of
Bethel,
one;
012:017
The
king
of
Tappuah,
one;
the
king
of
Hepher,
one;
012:018
The
king
of
Aphek,
one;
the
king
of
Lasharon,
one;
012:019
The
king
of
Madon,
one;
the
king
of
Hazor,
one;
012:020
The
king
of
Shimronmeron,
one;
the
king
of
Achshaph,
one;
012:021
The
king
of
Taanach,
one;
the
king
of
Megiddo,
one;
012:022
The
king
of
Kedesh,
one;
the
king
of
Jokneam
of
Carmel,
one;
012:023
The
king
of
Dor
in
the
coast
of
Dor,
one;
the
king
of
the
nations
of
Gilgal,
one;
012:024
The
king
of
Tirzah,
one:
all
the
kings
thirty
and
one.
013:001
Now
Joshua
was
old
and
stricken
in
years;
and
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Thou
art
old
and
stricken
in
years,
and
there
remaineth
yet
very
much
land
to
be
possessed.
013:002
This
is
the
land
that
yet
remaineth:
all
the
borders
of
the
Philistines,
and
all
Geshuri,
013:003
From
Sihor,
which
is
before
Egypt,
even
unto
the
borders
of
Ekron
northward,
which
is
counted
to
the
Canaanite:
five
lords
of
the
Philistines;
the
Gazathites,
and
the
Ashdothites,
the
Eshkalonites,
the
Gittites,
and
the
Ekronites;
also
the
Avites:
013:004
From
the
south,
all
the
land
of
the
Canaanites,
and
Mearah
that
is
beside
the
Sidonians
unto
Aphek,
to
the
borders
of
the
Amorites:
013:005
And
the
land
of
the
Giblites,
and
all
Lebanon,
toward
the
sunrising,
from
Baalgad
under
mount
Hermon
unto
the
entering
into
Hamath.
013:006
All
the
inhabitants
of
the
hill
country
from
Lebanon
unto
Misrephothmaim,
and
all
the
Sidonians,
them
will
I
drive
out
from
before
the
children
of
Israel:
only
divide
thou
it
by
lot
unto
the
Israelites
for
an
inheritance,
as
I
have
commanded
thee.
013:007
Now
therefore
divide
this
land
for
an
inheritance
unto
the
nine
tribes,
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh,
013:008
With
whom
the
Reubenites
and
the
Gadites
have
received
their
inheritance,
which
Moses
gave
them,
beyond
Jordan
eastward,
even
as
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
gave
them;
013:009
From
Aroer,
that
is
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
Arnon,
and
the
city
that
is
in
the
midst
of
the
river,
and
all
the
plain
of
Medeba
unto
Dibon;
013:010
And
all
the
cities
of
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
which
reigned
in
Heshbon,
unto
the
border
of
the
children
of
Ammon;
013:011
And
Gilead,
and
the
border
of
the
Geshurites
and
Maachathites,
and
all
mount
Hermon,
and
all
Bashan
unto
Salcah;
013:012
All
the
kingdom
of
Og
in
Bashan,
which
reigned
in
Ashtaroth
and
in
Edrei,
who
remained
of
the
remnant
of
the
giants:
for
these
did
Moses
smite,
and
cast
them
out.
013:013
Nevertheless
the
children
of
Israel
expelled
not
the
Geshurites,
nor
the
Maachathites:
but
the
Geshurites
and
the
Maachathites
dwell
among
the
Israelites
until
this
day.
013:014
Only
unto
the
tribes
of
Levi
he
gave
none
inheritance;
the
sacrifices
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
made
by
fire
are
their
inheritance,
as
he
said
unto
them.
013:015
And
Moses
gave
unto
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Reuben
inheritance
according
to
their
families.
013:016
And
their
coast
was
from
Aroer,
that
is
on
the
bank
of
the
river
Arnon,
and
the
city
that
is
in
the
midst
of
the
river,
and
all
the
plain
by
Medeba;
013:017
Heshbon,
and
all
her
cities
that
are
in
the
plain;
Dibon,
and
Bamothbaal,
and
Bethbaalmeon,
013:018
And
Jahaza,
and
Kedemoth,
and
Mephaath,
013:019
And
Kirjathaim,
and
Sibmah,
and
Zarethshahar
in
the
mount
of
the
valley,
013:020
And
Bethpeor,
and
Ashdothpisgah,
and
Bethjeshimoth,
013:021
And
all
the
cities
of
the
plain,
and
all
the
kingdom
of
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
which
reigned
in
Heshbon,
whom
Moses
smote
with
the
princes
of
Midian,
Evi,
and
Rekem,
and
Zur,
and
Hur,
and
Reba,
which
were
dukes
of
Sihon,
dwelling
in
the
country.
013:022
Balaam
also
the
son
of
Beor,
the
soothsayer,
did
the
children
of
Israel
slay
with
the
sword
among
them
that
were
slain
by
them.
013:023
And
the
border
of
the
children
of
Reuben
was
Jordan,
and
the
border
thereof.
This
was
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Reuben
after
their
families,
the
cities
and
the
villages
thereof.
013:024
And
Moses
gave
inheritance
unto
the
tribe
of
Gad,
even
unto
the
children
of
Gad
according
to
their
families.
013:025
And
their
coast
was
Jazer,
and
all
the
cities
of
Gilead,
and
half
the
land
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
unto
Aroer
that
is
before
Rabbah;
013:026
And
from
Heshbon
unto
Ramathmizpeh,
and
Betonim;
and
from
Mahanaim
unto
the
border
of
Debir;
013:027
And
in
the
valley,
Betharam,
and
Bethnimrah,
and
Succoth,
and
Zaphon,
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
of
Sihon
king
of
Heshbon,
Jordan
and
his
border,
even
unto
the
edge
of
the
sea
of
Chinnereth
on
the
other
side
Jordan
eastward.
013:028
This
is
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Gad
after
their
families,
the
cities,
and
their
villages.
013:029
And
Moses
gave
inheritance
unto
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh:
and
this
was
the
possession
of
the
half
tribe
of
the
children
of
Manasseh
by
their
families.
013:030
And
their
coast
was
from
Mahanaim,
all
Bashan,
all
the
kingdom
of
Og
king
of
Bashan,
and
all
the
towns
of
Jair,
which
are
in
Bashan,
threescore
cities:
013:031
And
half
Gilead,
and
Ashtaroth,
and
Edrei,
cities
of
the
kingdom
of
Og
in
Bashan,
were
pertaining
unto
the
children
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh,
even
to
the
one
half
of
the
children
of
Machir
by
their
families.
013:032
These
are
the
countries
which
Moses
did
distribute
for
inheritance
in
the
plains
of
Moab,
on
the
other
side
Jordan,
by
Jericho,
eastward.
013:033
But
unto
the
tribe
of
Levi
Moses
gave
not
any
inheritance:
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
was
their
inheritance,
as
he
said
unto
them.
014:001
And
these
are
the
countries
which
the
children
of
Israel
inherited
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
which
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
and
the
heads
of
the
fathers
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
Israel,
distributed
for
inheritance
to
them.
014:002
By
lot
was
their
inheritance,
as
the
LORD
commanded
by
the
hand
of
Moses,
for
the
nine
tribes,
and
for
the
half
tribe.
014:003
For
Moses
had
given
the
inheritance
of
two
tribes
and
an
half
tribe
on
the
other
side
Jordan:
but
unto
the
Levites
he
gave
none
inheritance
among
them.
014:004
For
the
children
of
Joseph
were
two
tribes,
Manasseh
and
Ephraim:
therefore
they
gave
no
part
unto
the
Levites
in
the
land,
save
cities
to
dwell
in,
with
their
suburbs
for
their
cattle
and
for
their
substance.
014:005
As
the
LORD
commanded
Moses,
so
the
children
of
Israel
did,
and
they
divided
the
land.
014:006
Then
the
children
of
Judah
came
unto
Joshua
in
Gilgal:
and
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
the
Kenezite
said
unto
him,
Thou
knowest
the
thing
that
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses
the
man
of
God
concerning
me
and
thee
in
Kadeshbarnea.
014:007
Forty
years
old
was
I
when
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
sent
me
from
Kadeshbarnea
to
espy
out
the
land;
and
I
brought
him
word
again
as
it
was
in
mine
heart.
014:008
Nevertheless
my
brethren
that
went
up
with
me
made
the
heart
of
the
people
melt:
but
I
wholly
followed
the
LORD
my
God.
014:009
And
Moses
sware
on
that
day,
saying,
Surely
the
land
whereon
thy
feet
have
trodden
shall
be
thine
inheritance,
and
thy
children's
for
ever,
because
thou
hast
wholly
followed
the
LORD
my
God.
014:010
And
now,
behold,
the
LORD
hath
kept
me
alive,
as
he
said,
these
forty
and
five
years,
even
since
the
LORD
spake
this
word
unto
Moses,
while
the
children
of
Israel
wandered
in
the
wilderness:
and
now,
lo,
I
am
this
day
fourscore
and
five
years
old.
014:011
As
yet
I
am
as
strong
this
day
as
I
was
in
the
day
that
Moses
sent
me:
as
my
strength
was
then,
even
so
is
my
strength
now,
for
war,
both
to
go
out,
and
to
come
in.
014:012
Now
therefore
give
me
this
mountain,
whereof
the
LORD
spake
in
that
day;
for
thou
heardest
in
that
day
how
the
Anakims
were
there,
and
that
the
cities
were
great
and
fenced:
if
so
be
the
LORD
will
be
with
me,
then
I
shall
be
able
to
drive
them
out,
as
the
LORD
said.
014:013
And
Joshua
blessed
him,
and
gave
unto
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
Hebron
for
an
inheritance.
014:014
Hebron
therefore
became
the
inheritance
of
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
the
Kenezite
unto
this
day,
because
that
he
wholly
followed
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
014:015
And
the
name
of
Hebron
before
was
Kirjatharba;
which
Arba
was
a
great
man
among
the
Anakims.
And
the
land
had
rest
from
war.
015:001
This
then
was
the
lot
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Judah
by
their
families;
even
to
the
border
of
Edom
the
wilderness
of
Zin
southward
was
the
uttermost
part
of
the
south
coast.
015:002
And
their
south
border
was
from
the
shore
of
the
salt
sea,
from
the
bay
that
looketh
southward:
015:003
And
it
went
out
to
the
south
side
to
Maalehacrabbim,
and
passed
along
to
Zin,
and
ascended
up
on
the
south
side
unto
Kadeshbarnea,
and
passed
along
to
Hezron,
and
went
up
to
Adar,
and
fetched
a
compass
to
Karkaa:
015:004
From
thence
it
passed
toward
Azmon,
and
went
out
unto
the
river
of
Egypt;
and
the
goings
out
of
that
coast
were
at
the
sea:
this
shall
be
your
south
coast.
015:005
And
the
east
border
was
the
salt
sea,
even
unto
the
end
of
Jordan.
And
their
border
in
the
north
quarter
was
from
the
bay
of
the
sea
at
the
uttermost
part
of
Jordan:
015:006
And
the
border
went
up
to
Bethhogla,
and
passed
along
by
the
north
of
Betharabah;
and
the
border
went
up
to
the
stone
of
Bohan
the
son
of
Reuben:
015:007
And
the
border
went
up
toward
Debir
from
the
valley
of
Achor,
and
so
northward,
looking
toward
Gilgal,
that
is
before
the
going
up
to
Adummim,
which
is
on
the
south
side
of
the
river:
and
the
border
passed
toward
the
waters
of
Enshemesh,
and
the
goings
out
thereof
were
at
Enrogel:
015:008
And
the
border
went
up
by
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom
unto
the
south
side
of
the
Jebusite;
the
same
is
Jerusalem:
and
the
border
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
that
lieth
before
the
valley
of
Hinnom
westward,
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
valley
of
the
giants
northward:
015:009
And
the
border
was
drawn
from
the
top
of
the
hill
unto
the
fountain
of
the
water
of
Nephtoah,
and
went
out
to
the
cities
of
mount
Ephron;
and
the
border
was
drawn
to
Baalah,
which
is
Kirjathjearim:
015:010
And
the
border
compassed
from
Baalah
westward
unto
mount
Seir,
and
passed
along
unto
the
side
of
mount
Jearim,
which
is
Chesalon,
on
the
north
side,
and
went
down
to
Bethshemesh,
and
passed
on
to
Timnah:
015:011
And
the
border
went
out
unto
the
side
of
Ekron
northward:
and
the
border
was
drawn
to
Shicron,
and
passed
along
to
mount
Baalah,
and
went
out
unto
Jabneel;
and
the
goings
out
of
the
border
were
at
the
sea.
015:012
And
the
west
border
was
to
the
great
sea,
and
the
coast
thereof.
This
is
the
coast
of
the
children
of
Judah
round
about
according
to
their
families.
015:013
And
unto
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
he
gave
a
part
among
the
children
of
Judah,
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
to
Joshua,
even
the
city
of
Arba
the
father
of
Anak,
which
city
is
Hebron.
015:014
And
Caleb
drove
thence
the
three
sons
of
Anak,
Sheshai,
and
Ahiman,
and
Talmai,
the
children
of
Anak.
015:015
And
he
went
up
thence
to
the
inhabitants
of
Debir:
and
the
name
of
Debir
before
was
Kirjathsepher.
015:016
And
Caleb
said,
He
that
smiteth
Kirjathsepher,
and
taketh
it,
to
him
will
I
give
Achsah
my
daughter
to
wife.
015:017
And
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz,
the
brother
of
Caleb,
took
it:
and
he
gave
him
Achsah
his
daughter
to
wife.
015:018
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
she
came
unto
him,
that
she
moved
him
to
ask
of
her
father
a
field:
and
she
lighted
off
her
ass;
and
Caleb
said
unto
her,
What
wouldest
thou?
015:019
Who
answered,
Give
me
a
blessing;
for
thou
hast
given
me
a
south
land;
give
me
also
springs
of
water.
And
he
gave
her
the
upper
springs,
and
the
nether
springs.
015:020
This
is
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Judah
according
to
their
families.
015:021
And
the
uttermost
cities
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Judah
toward

And

and
the
city

and

six
cities
with

015:063
As
for
the
Jebusites
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
the
children
of
Judah
could
not
drive
them
out;
but
the
Jebusites
dwell
with
the
children
of
Judah
at
Jerusalem
unto
this
day.
016:001
And
the
lot
of
the
children
of
Joseph
fell
from
Jordan
by
Jericho,
unto
the
water
of
Jericho
on
the
east,
to
the
wilderness
that
goeth
up
from
Jericho
throughout
mount
Bethel,
016:002
And
goeth
out
from
Bethel
to
Luz,
and
passeth
along
unto
the
borders
of
Archi
to
Ataroth,
016:003
And
goeth
down
westward
to
the
coast
of
Japhleti,
unto
the
coast
of
Bethhoron
the
nether,
and
to
Gezer;
and
the
goings
out
thereof
are
at
the
sea.
016:004
So
the
children
of
Joseph,
Manasseh
and
Ephraim,
took
their
inheritance.
016:005
And
the
border
of
the
children
of
Ephraim
according
to
their
families
was
thus:
even
the
border
of
their
inheritance
on
the
east
side
was
Atarothaddar,
unto
Bethhoron
the
upper;
016:006
And
the
border
went
out
toward
the
sea
to
Michmethah
on
the
north
side;
and
the
border
went
about
eastward
unto
Taanathshiloh,
and
passed
by
it
on
the
east
to
Janohah;
016:007
And
it
went
down
from
Janohah
to
Ataroth,
and
to
Naarath,
and
came
to
Jericho,
and
went
out
at
Jordan.
016:008
The
border
went
out
from
Tappuah
westward
unto
the
river
Kanah;
and
the
goings
out
thereof
were
at
the
sea.
This
is
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Ephraim
by
their
families.
016:009
And
the
separate
cities
for
the
children
of
Ephraim
were
among
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Manasseh,
all
the
cities
with
their
villages.
016:010
And
they
drave
not
out
the
Canaanites
that
dwelt
in
Gezer:
but
the
Canaanites
dwell
among
the
Ephraimites
unto
this
day,
and
serve
under
tribute.
017:001
There
was
also
a
lot
for
the
tribe
of
Manasseh;
for
he
was
the
firstborn
of
Joseph;
to
wit,
for
Machir
the
firstborn
of
Manasseh,
the
father
of
Gilead:
because
he
was
a
man
of
war,
therefore
he
had
Gilead
and
Bashan.
017:002
There
was
also
a
lot
for
the
rest
of
the
children
of
Manasseh
by
their
families;
for
the
children
of
Abiezer,
and
for
the
children
of
Helek,
and
for
the
children
of
Asriel,
and
for
the
children
of
Shechem,
and
for
the
children
of
Hepher,
and
for
the
children
of
Shemida:
these
were
the
male
children
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Joseph
by
their
families.
017:003
But
Zelophehad,
the
son
of
Hepher,
the
son
of
Gilead,
the
son
of
Machir,
the
son
of
Manasseh,
had
no
sons,
but
daughters:
and
these
are
the
names
of
his
daughters,
Mahlah,
and
Noah,
Hoglah,
Milcah,
and
Tirzah.
017:004
And
they
came
near
before
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
before
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
and
before
the
princes,
saying,
The
LORD
commanded
Moses
to
give
us
an
inheritance
among
our
brethren.
Therefore
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
he
gave
them
an
inheritance
among
the
brethren
of
their
father.
017:005
And
there
fell
ten
portions
to
Manasseh,
beside
the
land
of
Gilead
and
Bashan,
which
were
on
the
other
side
Jordan;
017:006
Because
the
daughters
of
Manasseh
had
an
inheritance
among
his
sons:
and
the
rest
of
Manasseh's
sons
had
the
land
of
Gilead.
017:007
And
the
coast
of
Manasseh
was
from
Asher
to
Michmethah,
that
lieth
before
Shechem;
and
the
border
went
along
on
the
right
hand
unto
the
inhabitants
of
Entappuah.
017:008
Now
Manasseh
had
the
land
of
Tappuah:
but
Tappuah
on
the
border
of
Manasseh
belonged
to
the
children
of
Ephraim;
017:009
And
the
coast
descended
unto
the
river
Kanah,
southward
of
the
river:
these
cities
of
Ephraim
are
among
the
cities
of
Manasseh:
the
coast
of
Manasseh
also
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
river,
and
the
outgoings
of
it
were
at
the
sea:
017:010
Southward
it
was
Ephraim's,
and
northward
it
was
Manasseh's,
and
the
sea
is
his
border;
and
they
met
together
in
Asher
on
the
north,
and
in
Issachar
on
the
east.
017:011
And
Manasseh
had
in
Issachar
and
in
Asher
Bethshean
and
her
towns,
and
Ibleam
and
her
towns,
and
the
inhabitants
of
Dor
and
her
towns,
and
the
inhabitants
of
Endor
and
her
towns,
and
the
inhabitants
of
Taanach
and
her
towns,
and
the
inhabitants
of
Megiddo
and
her
towns,
even
three
countries.
017:012
Yet
the
children
of
Manasseh
could
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
those
cities;
but
the
Canaanites
would
dwell
in
that
land.
017:013
Yet
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
children
of
Israel
were
waxen
strong,
that
they
put
the
Canaanites
to
tribute,
but
did
not
utterly
drive
them
out.
017:014
And
the
children
of
Joseph
spake
unto
Joshua,
saying,
Why
hast
thou
given
me
but
one
lot
and
one
portion
to
inherit,
seeing
I
am
a
great
people,
forasmuch
as
the
LORD
hath
blessed
me
hitherto?
017:015
And
Joshua
answered
them,
If
thou
be
a
great
people,
then
get
thee
up
to
the
wood
country,
and
cut
down
for
thyself
there
in
the
land
of
the
Perizzites
and
of
the
giants,
if
mount
Ephraim
be
too
narrow
for
thee.
017:016
And
the
children
of
Joseph
said,
The
hill
is
not
enough
for
us:
and
all
the
Canaanites
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
valley
have
chariots
of
iron,
both
they
who
are
of
Bethshean
and
her
towns,
and
they
who
are
of
the
valley
of
Jezreel.
017:017
And
Joshua
spake
unto
the
house
of
Joseph,
even
to
Ephraim
and
to
Manasseh,
saying,
Thou
art
a
great
people,
and
hast
great
power:
thou
shalt
not
have
one
lot
only:
017:018
But
the
mountain
shall
be
thine;
for
it
is
a
wood,
and
thou
shalt
cut
it
down:
and
the
outgoings
of
it
shall
be
thine:
for
thou
shalt
drive
out
the
Canaanites,
though
they
have
iron
chariots,
and
though
they
be
strong.
018:001
And
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
assembled
together
at
Shiloh,
and
set
up
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
there.
And
