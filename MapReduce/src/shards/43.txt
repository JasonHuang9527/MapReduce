the
land
was
subdued
before
them.
018:002
And
there
remained
among
the
children
of
Israel
seven
tribes,
which
had
not
yet
received
their
inheritance.
018:003
And
Joshua
said
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
How
long
are
ye
slack
to
go
to
possess
the
land,
which
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers
hath
given
you?
018:004
Give
out
from
among
you
three
men
for
each
tribe:
and
I
will
send
them,
and
they
shall
rise,
and
go
through
the
land,
and
describe
it
according
to
the
inheritance
of
them;
and
they
shall
come
again
to
me.
018:005
And
they
shall
divide
it
into
seven
parts:
Judah
shall
abide
in
their
coast
on
the
south,
and
the
house
of
Joseph
shall
abide
in
their
coasts
on
the
north.
018:006
Ye
shall
therefore
describe
the
land
into
seven
parts,
and
bring
the
description
hither
to
me,
that
I
may
cast
lots
for
you
here
before
the
LORD
our
God.
018:007
But
the
Levites
have
no
part
among
you;
for
the
priesthood
of
the
LORD
is
their
inheritance:
and
Gad,
and
Reuben,
and
half
the
tribe
of
Manasseh,
have
received
their
inheritance
beyond
Jordan
on
the
east,
which
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
gave
them.
018:008
And
the
men
arose,
and
went
away:
and
Joshua
charged
them
that
went
to
describe
the
land,
saying,
Go
and
walk
through
the
land,
and
describe
it,
and
come
again
to
me,
that
I
may
here
cast
lots
for
you
before
the
LORD
in
Shiloh.
018:009
And
the
men
went
and
passed
through
the
land,
and
described
it
by
cities
into
seven
parts
in
a
book,
and
came
again
to
Joshua
to
the
host
at
Shiloh.
018:010
And
Joshua
cast
lots
for
them
in
Shiloh
before
the
LORD:
and
there
Joshua
divided
the
land
unto
the
children
of
Israel
according
to
their
divisions.
018:011
And
the
lot
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Benjamin
came
up
according
to
their
families:
and
the
coast
of
their
lot
came
forth
between
the
children
of
Judah
and
the
children
of
Joseph.
018:012
And
their
border
on
the
north
side
was
from
Jordan;
and
the
border
went
up
to
the
side
of
Jericho
on
the
north
side,
and
went
up
through
the
mountains
westward;
and
the
goings
out
thereof
were
at
the
wilderness
of
Bethaven.
018:013
And
the
border
went
over
from
thence
toward
Luz,
to
the
side
of
Luz,
which
is
Bethel,
southward;
and
the
border
descended
to
Atarothadar,
near
the
hill
that
lieth
on
the
south
side
of
the
nether
Bethhoron.
018:014
And
the
border
was
drawn
thence,
and
compassed
the
corner
of
the
sea
southward,
from
the
hill
that
lieth
before
Bethhoron
southward;
and
the
goings
out
thereof
were
at
Kirjathbaal,
which
is
Kirjathjearim,
a
city
of
the
children
of
Judah:
this
was
the
west
quarter.
018:015
And
the
south
quarter
was
from
the
end
of
Kirjathjearim,
and
the
border
went
out
on
the
west,
and
went
out
to
the
well
of
waters
of
Nephtoah:
018:016
And
the
border
came
down
to
the
end
of
the
mountain
that
lieth
before
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
and
which
is
in
the
valley
of
the
giants
on
the
north,
and
descended
to
the
valley
of
Hinnom,
to
the
side
of
Jebusi
on
the
south,
and
descended
to
Enrogel,
018:017
And
was
drawn
from
the
north,
and
went
forth
to
Enshemesh,
and
went
forth
toward
Geliloth,
which
is
over
against
the
going
up
of
Adummim,
and
descended
to
the
stone
of
Bohan
the
son
of
Reuben,
018:018
And
passed
along
toward
the
side
over
against
Arabah
northward,
and
went
down
unto
Arabah:
018:019
And
the
border
passed
along
to
the
side
of
Bethhoglah
northward:
and
the
outgoings
of
the
border
were
at
the
north
bay
of
the
salt
sea
at
the
south
end
of
Jordan:
this
was
the
south
coast.
018:020
And
Jordan
was
the
border
of
it
on
the
east
side.
This
was
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Benjamin,
by
the
coasts
thereof
round
about,
according
to
their
families.
018:021
Now
the
cities
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Benjamin
according
to
their
families
were
Jericho,
and
Bethhoglah,
and
the

of
Keziz,
018:022
And
Betharabah,

And

cities
with
their

This
is
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Benjamin
according
to
their
families.
019:001
And
the
second
lot
came
forth
to
Simeon,
even
for
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Simeon
according
to
their
families:
and
their
inheritance
was
within
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Judah.
019:002
And
they
had
in
their
inheritance
Beersheba,
and

019:008
And
all
the

that
were
round
about
these
cities
to
Baalathbeer,
Ramath
of
the
south.
This
is
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
Simeon
according
to
their
families.
019:009
Out
of
the
portion
of
the
children
of
Judah
was
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Simeon:
for
the
part
of
the
children
of
Judah
was
too
much
for
them:
therefore
the
children
of
Simeon
had
their
inheritance
within
the
inheritance
of
them.
019:010
And
the
third
lot
came
up
for
the
children
of
Zebulun
according
to
their
families:
and
the

of
their

was

019:011
And
their

and
reached
to

and

And

And

And

019:016
This

according

019:017
And

And

This

And

And

019:047
And
the
coast
of
the
children
of
Dan
went
out
too
little
for
them:
therefore
the
children
of
Dan
went
up
to
fight
against
Leshem,
and
took
it,
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
possessed
it,
and
dwelt

and
called
Leshem,
Dan,
after
the

of

019:048
This
is
the

of
the
tribe
of
the

according

019:049
When
they
had
made
an
end
of
dividing
the
land
for
inheritance
by
their
coasts,
the
children
of
Israel
gave
an
inheritance
to
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
among
them:
019:050
According
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
they
gave
him
the
city
which
he
asked,
even
Timnathserah
in
mount
Ephraim:
and
he
built
the
city,
and
dwelt
therein.
019:051
These
are
the
inheritances,
which
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
and
the
heads
of
the
fathers
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
Israel,
divided
for
an
inheritance
by
lot
in
Shiloh
before
the
LORD,
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
So
they
made
an
end
of
dividing
the
country.
020:001
The
LORD
also
spake
unto
Joshua,
saying,
020:002
Speak
to
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
Appoint
out
for
you
cities
of
refuge,
whereof
I
spake
unto
you
by
the
hand
of
Moses:
020:003
That
the
slayer
that
killeth
any
person
unawares
and
unwittingly
may
flee
thither:
and
they
shall
be
your
refuge
from
the
avenger
of
blood.
020:004
And
when
he
that
doth
flee
unto
one
of
those
cities
shall
stand
at
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city,
and
shall
declare
his
cause
in
the
ears
of
the
elders
of
that
city,
they
shall
take
him
into
the
city
unto
them,
and
give
him
a
place,
that
he
may
dwell
among
them.
020:005
And
if
the
avenger
of
blood
pursue
after
him,
then
they
shall
not
deliver
the
slayer
up
into
his
hand;
because
he
smote
his
neighbour
unwittingly,
and
hated
him
not
beforetime.
020:006
And
he
shall
dwell
in
that
city,
until
he
stand
before
the
congregation
for
judgment,
and
until
the
death
of
the
high
priest
that
shall
be
in
those
days:
then
shall
the
slayer
return,
and
come
unto
his
own
city,
and
unto
his
own
house,
unto
the
city
from
whence
he
fled.
020:007
And
they
appointed
Kedesh
in
Galilee
in
mount
Naphtali,
and
Shechem
in
mount
Ephraim,
and
Kirjatharba,
which
is
Hebron,
in
the
mountain
of
Judah.
020:008
And
on
the
other
side
Jordan
by
Jericho
eastward,
they
assigned
Bezer
in
the
wilderness
upon
the
plain
out
of
the
tribe
of
Reuben,
and
Ramoth
in
Gilead
out
of
the
tribe
of
Gad,
and
Golan
in
Bashan
out
of
the
tribe
of
Manasseh.
020:009
These
were
the
cities
appointed
for
all
the
children
of
Israel,
and
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
them,
that
whosoever
killeth
any
person
at
unawares
might
flee
thither,
and
not
die
by
the
hand
of
the
avenger
of
blood,
until
he
stood
before
the
congregation.
021:001
Then
came
near
the
heads
of
the
fathers
of
the
Levites
unto
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
unto
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
and
unto
the
heads
of
the
fathers
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
Israel;
021:002
And
they
spake
unto
them
at
Shiloh
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
saying,
The
LORD
commanded
by
the
hand
of
Moses
to
give
us
cities
to
dwell
in,
with
the
suburbs
thereof
for
our
cattle.
021:003
And
the
children
of
Israel
gave
unto
the
Levites
out
of
their
inheritance,
at
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
these
cities
and
their
suburbs.
021:004
And
the
lot
came
out
for
the
families
of
the
Kohathites:
and
the
children
of
Aaron
the
priest,
which
were
of
the
Levites,
had
by
lot
out
of
the
tribe
of
Judah,
and
out
of
the
tribe
of
Simeon,
and
out
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin,
thirteen
cities.
021:005
And
the
rest
of
the
children
of
Kohath
had
by
lot
out
of
the
families
of
the
tribe
of
Ephraim,
and
out
of
the
tribe
of
Dan,
and
out
of
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh,

021:040
So
all
the

for
the
children
of
Merari
by
their
families,
which
were
remaining
of
the
families
of
the
Levites,
were
by
their
lot
twelve
cities.
021:041
All
the
cities
of
the
Levites
within
the
possession
of
the
children
of
Israel
were
forty
and
eight
cities
with
their
suburbs.
021:042
These
cities
were
every
one
with
their
suburbs
round
about
them:
thus
were
all
these
cities.
021:043
And
the
LORD
gave
unto
Israel
all
the
land
which
he
sware
to
give
unto
their
fathers;
and
they
possessed
it,
and
dwelt
therein.
021:044
And
the
LORD
gave
them
rest
round
about,
according
to
all
that
he
sware
unto
their
fathers:
and
there
stood
not
a
man
of
all
their
enemies
before
them;
the
LORD
delivered
all
their
enemies
into
their
hand.
021:045
There
failed
not
ought
of
any
good
thing
which
the
LORD
had
spoken
unto
the
house
of
Israel;
all
came
to
pass.
022:001
Then
Joshua
called
the
Reubenites,
and
the
Gadites,
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh,
022:002
And
said
unto
them,
Ye
have
kept
all
that
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
commanded
you,
and
have
obeyed
my
voice
in
all
that
I
commanded
you:
022:003
Ye
have
not
left
your
brethren
these
many
days
unto
this
day,
but
have
kept
the
charge
of
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
your
God.
022:004
And
now
the
LORD
your
God
hath
given
rest
unto
your
brethren,
as
he
promised
them:
therefore
now
return
ye,
and
get
you
unto
your
tents,
and
unto
the
land
of
your
possession,
which
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
gave
you
on
the
other
side
Jordan.
022:005
But
take
diligent
heed
to
do
the
commandment
and
the
law,
which
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
charged
you,
to
love
the
LORD
your
God,
and
to
walk
in
all
his
ways,
and
to
keep
his
commandments,
and
to
cleave
unto
him,
and
to
serve
him
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul.
022:006
So
Joshua
blessed
them,
and
sent
them
away:
and
they
went
unto
their
tents.
022:007
Now
to
the
one
half
of
the
tribe
of
Manasseh
Moses
had
given
possession
in
Bashan:
but
unto
the
other
half
thereof
gave
Joshua
among
their
brethren
on
this
side
Jordan
westward.
And
when
Joshua
sent
them
away
also
unto
their
tents,
then
he
blessed
them,
022:008
And
he
spake
unto
them,
saying,
Return
with
much
riches
unto
your
tents,
and
with
very
much
cattle,
with
silver,
and
with
gold,
and
with
brass,
and
with
iron,
and
with
very
much
raiment:
divide
the
spoil
of
your
enemies
with
your
brethren.
022:009
And
the
children
of
Reuben
and
the
children
of
Gad
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
returned,
and
departed
from
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
Shiloh,
which
is
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
to
go
unto
the
country
of
Gilead,
to
the
land
of
their
possession,
whereof
they
were
possessed,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
022:010
And
when
they
came
unto
the
borders
of
Jordan,
that
are
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
the
children
of
Reuben
and
the
children
of
Gad
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
built
there
an
altar
by
Jordan,
a
great
altar
to
see
to.
022:011
And
the
children
of
Israel
heard
say,
Behold,
the
children
of
Reuben
and
the
children
of
Gad
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
have
built
an
altar
over
against
the
land
of
Canaan,
in
the
borders
of
Jordan,
at
the
passage
of
the
children
of
Israel.
022:012
And
when
the
children
of
Israel
heard
of
it,
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
gathered
themselves
together
at
Shiloh,
to
go
up
to
war
against
them.
022:013
And
the
children
of
Israel
sent
unto
the
children
of
Reuben,
and
to
the
children
of
Gad,
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh,
into
the
land
of
Gilead,
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
priest,
022:014
And
with
him
ten
princes,
of
each
chief
house
a
prince
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
Israel;
and
each
one
was
an
head
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
among
the
thousands
of
Israel.
022:015
And
they
came
unto
the
children
of
Reuben,
and
to
the
children
of
Gad,
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh,
unto
the
land
of
Gilead,
and
they
spake
with
them,
saying,
022:016
Thus
saith
the
whole
congregation
of
the
LORD,
What
trespass
is
this
that
ye
have
committed
against
the
God
of
Israel,
to
turn
away
this
day
from
following
the
LORD,
in
that
ye
have
builded
you
an
altar,
that
ye
might
rebel
this
day
against
the
LORD?
022:017
Is
the
iniquity
of
Peor
too
little
for
us,
from
which
we
are
not
cleansed
until
this
day,
although
there
was
a
plague
in
the
congregation
of
the
LORD,
022:018
But
that
ye
must
turn
away
this
day
from
following
the
LORD?
and
it
will
be,
seeing
ye
rebel
to
day
against
the
LORD,
that
to
morrow
he
will
be
wroth
with
the
whole
congregation
of
Israel.
022:019
Notwithstanding,
if
the
land
of
your
possession
be
unclean,
then
pass
ye
over
unto
the
land
of
the
possession
of
the
LORD,
wherein
the
LORD's
tabernacle
dwelleth,
and
take
possession
among
us:
but
rebel
not
against
the
LORD,
nor
rebel
against
us,
in
building
you
an
altar
beside
the
altar
of
the
LORD
our
God.
022:020
Did
not
Achan
the
son
of
Zerah
commit
a
trespass
in
the
accursed
thing,
and
wrath
fell
on
all
the
congregation
of
Israel?
and
that
man
perished
not
alone
in
his
iniquity.
022:021
Then
the
children
of
Reuben
and
the
children
of
Gad
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
answered,
and
said
unto
the
heads
of
the
thousands
of
Israel,
022:022
The
LORD
God
of
gods,
the
LORD
God
of
gods,
he
knoweth,
and
Israel
he
shall
know;
if
it
be
in
rebellion,
or
if
in
transgression
against
the
LORD,
(save
us
not
this
day,)
022:023
That
we
have
built
us
an
altar
to
turn
from
following
the
LORD,
or
if
to
offer
thereon
burnt
offering
or
meat
offering,
or
if
to
offer
peace
offerings
thereon,
let
the
LORD
himself
require
it;
022:024
And
if
we
have
not
rather
done
it
for
fear
of
this
thing,
saying,
In
time
to
come
your
children
might
speak
unto
our
children,
saying,
What
have
ye
to
do
with
the
LORD
God
of
Israel?
022:025
For
the
LORD
hath
made
Jordan
a
border
between
us
and
you,
ye
children
of
Reuben
and
children
of
Gad;
ye
have
no
part
