in
the
LORD:
so
shall
your
children
make
our
children
cease
from
fearing
the
LORD.
022:026
Therefore
we
said,
Let
us
now
prepare
to
build
us
an
altar,
not
for
burnt
offering,
nor
for
sacrifice:
022:027
But
that
it
may
be
a
witness
between
us,
and
you,
and
our
generations
after
us,
that
we
might
do
the
service
of
the
LORD
before
him
with
our
burnt
offerings,
and
with
our
sacrifices,
and
with
our
peace
offerings;
that
your
children
may
not
say
to
our
children
in
time
to
come,
Ye
have
no
part
in
the
LORD.
022:028
Therefore
said
we,
that
it
shall
be,
when
they
should
so
say
to
us
or
to
our
generations
in
time
to
come,
that
we
may
say
again,
Behold
the
pattern
of
the
altar
of
the
LORD,
which
our
fathers
made,
not
for
burnt
offerings,
nor
for
sacrifices;
but
it
is
a
witness
between
us
and
you.
022:029
God
forbid
that
we
should
rebel
against
the
LORD,
and
turn
this
day
from
following
the
LORD,
to
build
an
altar
for
burnt
offerings,
for
meat
offerings,
or
for
sacrifices,
beside
the
altar
of
the
LORD
our
God
that
is
before
his
tabernacle.
022:030
And
when
Phinehas
the
priest,
and
the
princes
of
the
congregation
and
heads
of
the
thousands
of
Israel
which
were
with
him,
heard
the
words
that
the
children
of
Reuben
and
the
children
of
Gad
and
the
children
of
Manasseh
spake,
it
pleased
them.
022:031
And
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
priest
said
unto
the
children
of
Reuben,
and
to
the
children
of
Gad,
and
to
the
children
of
Manasseh,
This
day
we
perceive
that
the
LORD
is
among
us,
because
ye
have
not
committed
this
trespass
against
the
LORD:
now
ye
have
delivered
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
LORD.
022:032
And
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
priest,
and
the
princes,
returned
from
the
children
of
Reuben,
and
from
the
children
of
Gad,
out
of
the
land
of
Gilead,
unto
the
land
of
Canaan,
to
the
children
of
Israel,
and
brought
them
word
again.
022:033
And
the
thing
pleased
the
children
of
Israel;
and
the
children
of
Israel
blessed
God,
and
did
not
intend
to
go
up
against
them
in
battle,
to
destroy
the
land
wherein
the
children
of
Reuben
and
Gad
dwelt.
022:034
And
the
children
of
Reuben
and
the
children
of
Gad
called
the
altar
Ed:
for
it
shall
be
a
witness
between
us
that
the
LORD
is
God.
023:001
And
it
came
to
pass
a
long
time
after
that
the
LORD
had
given
rest
unto
Israel
from
all
their
enemies
round
about,
that
Joshua
waxed
old
and
stricken
in
age.
023:002
And
Joshua
called
for
all
Israel,
and
for
their
elders,
and
for
their
heads,
and
for
their
judges,
and
for
their
officers,
and
said
unto
them,
I
am
old
and
stricken
in
age:
023:003
And
ye
have
seen
all
that
the
LORD
your
God
hath
done
unto
all
these
nations
because
of
you;
for
the
LORD
your
God
is
he
that
hath
fought
for
you.
023:004
Behold,
I
have
divided
unto
you
by
lot
these
nations
that
remain,
to
be
an
inheritance
for
your
tribes,
from
Jordan,
with
all
the
nations
that
I
have
cut
off,
even
unto
the
great
sea
westward.
023:005
And
the
LORD
your
God,
he
shall
expel
them
from
before
you,
and
drive
them
from
out
of
your
sight;
and
ye
shall
possess
their
land,
as
the
LORD
your
God
hath
promised
unto
you.
023:006
Be
ye
therefore
very
courageous
to
keep
and
to
do
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
Moses,
that
ye
turn
not
aside
therefrom
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left;
023:007
That
ye
come
not
among
these
nations,
these
that
remain
among
you;
neither
make
mention
of
the
name
of
their
gods,
nor
cause
to
swear
by
them,
neither
serve
them,
nor
bow
yourselves
unto
them:
023:008
But
cleave
unto
the
LORD
your
God,
as
ye
have
done
unto
this
day.
023:009
For
the
LORD
hath
driven
out
from
before
you
great
nations
and
strong:
but
as
for
you,
no
man
hath
been
able
to
stand
before
you
unto
this
day.
023:010
One
man
of
you
shall
chase
a
thousand:
for
the
LORD
your
God,
he
it
is
that
fighteth
for
you,
as
he
hath
promised
you.
023:011
Take
good
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves,
that
ye
love
the
LORD
your
God.
023:012
Else
if
ye
do
in
any
wise
go
back,
and
cleave
unto
the
remnant
of
these
nations,
even
these
that
remain
among
you,
and
shall
make
marriages
with
them,
and
go
in
unto
them,
and
they
to
you:
023:013
Know
for
a
certainty
that
the
LORD
your
God
will
no
more
drive
out
any
of
these
nations
from
before
you;
but
they
shall
be
snares
and
traps
unto
you,
and
scourges
in
your
sides,
and
thorns
in
your
eyes,
until
ye
perish
from
off
this
good
land
which
the
LORD
your
God
hath
given
you.
023:014
And,
behold,
this
day
I
am
going
the
way
of
all
the
earth:
and
ye
know
in
all
your
hearts
and
in
all
your
souls,
that
not
one
thing
hath
failed
of
all
the
good
things
which
the
LORD
your
God
spake
concerning
you;
all
are
come
to
pass
unto
you,
and
not
one
thing
hath
failed
thereof.
023:015
Therefore
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
as
all
good
things
are
come
upon
you,
which
the
LORD
your
God
promised
you;
so
shall
the
LORD
bring
upon
you
all
evil
things,
until
he
have
destroyed
you
from
off
this
good
land
which
the
LORD
your
God
hath
given
you.
023:016
When
ye
have
transgressed
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
your
God,
which
he
commanded
you,
and
have
gone
and
served
other
gods,
and
bowed
yourselves
to
them;
then
shall
the
anger
of
the
LORD
be
kindled
against
you,
and
ye
shall
perish
quickly
from
off
the
good
land
which
he
hath
given
unto
you.
024:001
And
Joshua
gathered
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
Shechem,
and
called
for
the
elders
of
Israel,
and
for
their
heads,
and
for
their
judges,
and
for
their
officers;
and
they
presented
themselves
before
God.
024:002
And
Joshua
said
unto
all
the
people,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Your
fathers
dwelt
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
in
old
time,
even
Terah,
the
father
of
Abraham,
and
the
father
of
Nachor:
and
they
served
other
gods.
024:003
And
I
took
your
father
Abraham
from
the
other
side
of
the
flood,
and
led
him
throughout
all
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
multiplied
his
seed,
and
gave
him
Isaac.
024:004
And
I
gave
unto
Isaac
Jacob
and
Esau:
and
I
gave
unto
Esau
mount
Seir,
to
possess
it;
but
Jacob
and
his
children
went
down
into
Egypt.
024:005
I
sent
Moses
also
and
Aaron,
and
I
plagued
Egypt,
according
to
that
which
I
did
among
them:
and
afterward
I
brought
you
out.
024:006
And
I
brought
your
fathers
out
of
Egypt:
and
ye
came
unto
the
sea;
and
the
Egyptians
pursued
after
your
fathers
with
chariots
and
horsemen
unto
the
Red
sea.
024:007
And
when
they
cried
unto
the
LORD,
he
put
darkness
between
you
and
the
Egyptians,
and
brought
the
sea
upon
them,
and
covered
them;
and
your
eyes
have
seen
what
I
have
done
in
Egypt:
and
ye
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
a
long
season.
024:008
And
I
brought
you
into
the
land
of
the
Amorites,
which
dwelt
on
the
other
side
Jordan;
and
they
fought
with
you:
and
I
gave
them
into
your
hand,
that
ye
might
possess
their
land;
and
I
destroyed
them
from
before
you.
024:009
Then
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor,
king
of
Moab,
arose
and
warred
against
Israel,
and
sent
and
called
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
to
curse
you:
024:010
But
I
would
not
hearken
unto
Balaam;
therefore
he
blessed
you
still:
so
I
delivered
you
out
of
his
hand.
024:011
And
you
went
over
Jordan,
and
came
unto
Jericho:
and
the
men
of
Jericho
fought
against
you,
the
Amorites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Hittites,
and
the
Girgashites,
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites;
and
I
delivered
them
into
your
hand.
024:012
And
I
sent
the
hornet
before
you,
which
drave
them
out
from
before
you,
even
the
two
kings
of
the
Amorites;
but
not
with
thy
sword,
nor
with
thy
bow.
024:013
And
I
have
given
you
a
land
for
which
ye
did
not
labour,
and
cities
which
ye
built
not,
and
ye
dwell
in
them;
of
the
vineyards
and
oliveyards
which
ye
planted
not
do
ye
eat.
024:014
Now
therefore
fear
the
LORD,
and
serve
him
in
sincerity
and
in
truth:
and
put
away
the
gods
which
your
fathers
served
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood,
and
in
Egypt;
and
serve
ye
the
LORD.
024:015
And
if
it
seem
evil
unto
you
to
serve
the
LORD,
choose
you
this
day
whom
ye
will
serve;
whether
the
gods
which
your
fathers
served
that
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood,
or
the
gods
of
the
Amorites,
in
whose
land
ye
dwell:
but
as
for
me
and
my
house,
we
will
serve
the
LORD.
024:016
And
the
people
answered
and
said,
God
forbid
that
we
should
forsake
the
LORD,
to
serve
other
gods;
024:017
For
the
LORD
our
God,
he
it
is
that
brought
us
up
and
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
from
the
house
of
bondage,
and
which
did
those
great
signs
in
our
sight,
and
preserved
us
in
all
the
way
wherein
we
went,
and
among
all
the
people
through
whom
we
passed:
024:018
And
the
LORD
drave
out
from
before
us
all
the
people,
even
the
Amorites
which
dwelt
in
the
land:
therefore
will
we
also
serve
the
LORD;
for
he
is
our
God.
024:019
And
Joshua
said
unto
the
people,
Ye
cannot
serve
the
LORD:
for
he
is
an
holy
God;
he
is
a
jealous
God;
he
will
not
forgive
your
transgressions
nor
your
sins.
024:020
If
ye
forsake
the
LORD,
and
serve
strange
gods,
then
he
will
turn
and
do
you
hurt,
and
consume
you,
after
that
he
hath
done
you
good.
024:021
And
the
people
said
unto
Joshua,
Nay;
but
we
will
serve
the
LORD.
024:022
And
Joshua
said
unto
the
people,
Ye
are
witnesses
against
yourselves
that
ye
have
chosen
you
the
LORD,
to
serve
him.
And
they
said,
We
are
witnesses.
024:023
Now
therefore
put
away,
said
he,
the
strange
gods
which
are
among
you,
and
incline
your
heart
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
024:024
And
the
people
said
unto
Joshua,
The
LORD
our
God
will
we
serve,
and
his
voice
will
we
obey.
024:025
So
Joshua
made
a
covenant
with
the
people
that
day,
and
set
them
a
statute
and
an
ordinance
in
Shechem.
024:026
And
Joshua
wrote
these
words
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
God,
and
took
a
great
stone,
and
set
it
up
there
under
an
oak,
that
was
by
the
sanctuary
of
the
LORD.
024:027
And
Joshua
said
unto
all
the
people,
Behold,
this
stone
shall
be
a
witness
unto
us;
for
it
hath
heard
all
the
words
of
the
LORD
which
he
spake
unto
us:
it
shall
be
therefore
a
witness
unto
you,
lest
ye
deny
your
God.
024:028
So
Joshua
let
the
people
depart,
every
man
unto
his
inheritance.
024:029
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things,
that
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
the
servant
of
the
LORD,
died,
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
old.
024:030
And
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
Timnathserah,
which
is
in
mount
Ephraim,
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
of
Gaash.
024:031
And
Israel
served
the
LORD
all
the
days
of
Joshua,
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
overlived
Joshua,
and
which
had
known
all
the
works
of
the
LORD,
that
he
had
done
for
Israel.
024:032
And
the
bones
of
Joseph,
which
the
children
of
Israel
brought
up
out
of
Egypt,
buried
they
in
Shechem,
in
a
parcel
of
ground
which
Jacob
bought
of
the
sons
of
Hamor
the
father
of
Shechem
for
an
hundred
pieces
of
silver:
and
it
became
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
Joseph.
024:033
And
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
died;
and
they
buried
him
in
a
hill
that
pertained
to
Phinehas
his
son,
which
was
given
him
in
mount
Ephraim.
Book
07	Judges
001:001
Now
after
the
death
of
Joshua
it
came
to
pass,
that
the
children
of
Israel
asked
the
LORD,
saying,
Who
shall
go
up
for
us
against
the
Canaanites
first,
to
fight
against
them?
001:002
And
the
LORD
said,
Judah
shall
go
up:
behold,
I
have
delivered
the
land
into
his
hand.
001:003
And
Judah
said
unto
Simeon
his
brother,
Come
up
with
me
into
my
lot,
that
we
may
fight
against
the
Canaanites;
and
I
likewise
will
go
with
thee
into
thy
lot.
So
Simeon
went
with
him.
001:004
And
Judah
went
up;
and
the
LORD
delivered
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites
into
their
hand:
and
they
slew
of
them
in
Bezek
ten
thousand
men.
001:005
And
they
found
Adonibezek
in
Bezek:
and
they
fought
against
him,
and
they
slew
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites.
001:006
But
Adonibezek
fled;
and
they
pursued
after
him,
and
caught
him,
and
cut
off
his
thumbs
and
his
great
toes.
001:007
And
Adonibezek
said,
Threescore
and
ten
kings,
having
their
thumbs
and
their
great
toes
cut
off,
gathered
their
meat
under
my
table:
as
I
have
done,
so
God
hath
requited
me.
And
they
brought
him
to
Jerusalem,
and
there
he
died.
001:008
Now
the
children
of
Judah
had
fought
against
Jerusalem,
and
had
taken
it,
and
smitten
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
set
the
city
on
fire.
001:009
And
afterward
the
children
of
Judah
went
down
to
fight
against
the
Canaanites,
that
dwelt
in
the
mountain,
and
in
the
south,
and
in
the
valley.
001:010
And
Judah
went
against
the
Canaanites
that
dwelt
in
Hebron:
(now
the
name
of
Hebron
before
was
Kirjatharba:)
and
they
slew
Sheshai,
and
Ahiman,
and
Talmai.
001:011
And
from
thence
he
went
against
the
inhabitants
of
Debir:
and
the
name
of
Debir
before
was
Kirjathsepher:
001:012
And
Caleb
said,
He
that
smiteth
Kirjathsepher,
and
taketh
it,
to
him
will
I
give
Achsah
my
daughter
to
wife.
001:013
And
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz,
Caleb's
younger
brother,
took
it:
and
he
gave
him
Achsah
his
daughter
to
wife.
001:014
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
she
came
to
him,
that
she
moved
him
to
ask
of
her
father
a
field:
and
she
lighted
from
off
her
ass;
and
Caleb
said
unto
her,
What
wilt
thou?
001:015
And
she
said
unto
him,
Give
me
a
blessing:
for
thou
hast
given
me
a
south
land;
give
me
also
springs
of
water.
And
Caleb
gave
her
the
upper
springs
and
the
nether
springs.
001:016
And
the
children
of
the
Kenite,
Moses'
father
in
law,
went
up
out
of
the
city
of
palm
trees
with
the
children
of
Judah
into
the
wilderness
of
Judah,
which
lieth
in
the
south
of
Arad;
and
they
went
and
dwelt
among
the
people.
001:017
And
Judah
went
with
Simeon
his
brother,
and
they
slew
the
Canaanites
that
inhabited
Zephath,
and
utterly
destroyed
it.
And
the
name
of
the
city
was
called
Hormah.
001:018
Also
Judah
took
Gaza
with
the
coast
thereof,
and
Askelon
with
the
coast
thereof,
and
Ekron
with
the
coast
thereof.
001:019
And
the
LORD
was
with
Judah;
and
he
drave
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountain;
but
could
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley,
because
they
had
chariots
of
iron.
001:020
And
they
gave
Hebron
unto
Caleb,
as
Moses
said:
and
he
expelled
thence
the
three
sons
of
Anak.
001:021
And
the
children
of
Benjamin
did
not
drive
out
the
Jebusites
that
inhabited
Jerusalem;
but
the
Jebusites
dwell
with
the
children
of
Benjamin
in
Jerusalem
unto
this
day.
001:022
And
the
house
of
Joseph,
they
also
went
up
against
Bethel:
and
the
LORD
was
with
them.
001:023
And
the
house
of
Joseph
sent
to
descry
Bethel.
(Now
the
name
of
the
city
before
was
Luz.)
001:024
And
the
spies
saw
a
man
come
forth
out
of
the
city,
and
they
said
unto
him,
Shew
us,
we
pray
thee,
the
entrance
into
the
city,
and
we
will
shew
thee
mercy.
001:025
And
when
he
shewed
them
the
entrance
into
the
city,
they
smote
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword;
but
they
let
go
the
man
and
all
his
family.
001:026
And
the
man
went
into
the
land
of
the
Hittites,
and
built
a
city,
and
called
the
name
thereof
Luz:
which
is
the
name
thereof
unto
this
day.
001:027
Neither
did
Manasseh
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Bethshean
and
her
towns,
nor
Taanach
and
her
towns,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Dor
and
her
towns,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Ibleam
and
her
towns,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Megiddo
and
her
towns:
but
the
Canaanites
would
dwell
in
that
land.
001:028
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Israel
was
strong,
that
they
put
the
Canaanites
to
tribute,
and
did
not
utterly
drive
them
out.
001:029
Neither
did
Ephraim
drive
out
the
Canaanites
that
dwelt
in
Gezer;
but
the
Canaanites
dwelt
in
Gezer
among
them.
001:030
Neither
did
Zebulun
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Kitron,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Nahalol;
but
the
Canaanites
dwelt
among
them,
and
became
tributaries.
001:031
Neither
did
Asher
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Accho,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Zidon,
nor
of
Ahlab,
nor
of
Achzib,
nor
of
Helbah,
nor
of
Aphik,
nor
of
Rehob:
001:032
But
the
Asherites
dwelt
among
the
Canaanites,
the
inhabitants
of
the
land:
for
they
did
not
drive
them
out.
001:033
Neither
did
Naphtali
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Bethshemesh,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Bethanath;
but
he
dwelt
among
the
Canaanites,
the
inhabitants
of
the
land:
nevertheless
the
inhabitants
of
Bethshemesh
and
of
Bethanath
became
tributaries
unto
them.
001:034
And
the
Amorites
forced
the
children
of
Dan
into
the
mountain:
for
they
would
not
suffer
them
to
come
down
to
the
valley:
001:035
But
the
Amorites
would
dwell
in
mount
Heres
in
Aijalon,
and
in
Shaalbim:
yet
the
hand
of
the
house
of
Joseph
prevailed,
so
that
they
became
tributaries.
001:036
And
the
coast
of
the
Amorites
was
from
the
going
up
to
Akrabbim,
from
the
rock,
and
upward.
002:001
And
an
angel
of
the
LORD
came
up
from
Gilgal
to
Bochim,
and
said,
I
made
you
to
go
up
out
of
Egypt,
and
have
brought
you
unto
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
your
fathers;
and
I
said,
I
will
never
break
my
covenant
with
you.
002:002
And
ye
shall
make
no
league
with
the
inhabitants
of
this
land;
ye
shall
throw
down
their
altars:
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice:
why
have
ye
done
this?
002:003
Wherefore
I
also
said,
I
will
not
drive
them
out
from
before
you;
but
they
shall
be
as
thorns
in
your
sides,
and
their
gods
shall
be
a
snare
unto
you.
002:004
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
angel
of
the
LORD
spake
these
words
unto
all
the
children
of
Israel,
that
the
people
lifted
up
their
voice,
and
wept.
002:005
And
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
Bochim:
and
they
sacrificed
there
unto
the
LORD.
002:006
And
when
Joshua
had
let
the
people
go,
the
children
of
Israel
went
every
man
unto
his
inheritance
to
possess
the
land.
002:007
And
the
people
served
the
LORD
all
the
days
of
Joshua,
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
outlived
Joshua,
who
had
seen
all
the
great
works
of
the
LORD,
that
he
did
for
Israel.
002:008
And
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun,
the
servant
of
the
LORD,
died,
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
old.
002:009
And
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
Timnathheres,
in
the
mount
of
Ephraim,
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
Gaash.
002:010
And
also
all
that
generation
were
gathered
unto
their
fathers:
and
there
arose
another
generation
after
them,
which
knew
not
the
LORD,
nor
yet
the
works
which
he
had
done
for
Israel.
002:011
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
served
Baalim:
002:012
And
they
forsook
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers,
which
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
followed
other
gods,
of
the
gods
of
the
people
that
were
round
about
them,
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them,
and
provoked
the
LORD
to
anger.
002:013
And
they
forsook
the
LORD,
and
served
Baal
and
Ashtaroth.
002:014
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
hot
against
Israel,
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
spoilers
that
spoiled
them,
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
round
about,
so
that
they
could
not
any
longer
stand
before
their
enemies.
002:015
Whithersoever
they
went
out,
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
against
them
for
evil,
as
the
LORD
had
said,
and
as
the
LORD
had
sworn
unto
them:
and
they
were
greatly
distressed.
002:016
Nevertheless
the
LORD
raised
up
judges,
which
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
those
that
spoiled
them.
002:017
And
yet
they
would
not
hearken
unto
their
judges,
but
they
went
a
whoring
after
other
gods,
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them:
they
turned
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
their
fathers
walked
in,
obeying
the
commandments
of
the
LORD;
but
they
did
not
so.
002:018
And
when
the
LORD
raised
them
up
judges,
then
the
LORD
was
with
the
judge,
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
enemies
all
the
days
of
the
judge:
for
it
repented
the
LORD
because
of
their
groanings
by
reason
of
them
that
oppressed
them
and
vexed
them.
002:019
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
judge
was
dead,
that
they
returned,
and
corrupted
themselves
more
than
their
fathers,
in
following
other
gods
to
serve
them,
and
to
bow
down
unto
them;
they
ceased
not
from
their
own
doings,
nor
from
their
stubborn
way.
002:020
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
hot
against
Israel;
and
he
said,
Because
that
this
people
hath
transgressed
my
covenant
which
I
commanded
their
fathers,
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
my
voice;
002:021
I
also
will
not
henceforth
drive
out
any
from
before
them
of
the
nations
which
Joshua
left
when
he
died:
002:022
That
through
them
I
may
prove
Israel,
whether
they
will
keep
the
way
of
the
LORD
to
walk
therein,
as
their
fathers
did
keep
it,
or
not.
002:023
Therefore
the
LORD
left
those
nations,
without
driving
them
out
hastily;
neither
delivered
he
them
into
the
hand
of
Joshua.
003:001
Now
these
are
the
nations
which
the
LORD
left,
to
prove
Israel
by
them,
even
as
many
of
Israel
as
had
not
known
all
the
wars
of
Canaan;
003:002
Only
that
the
generations
of
the
children
of
Israel
might
know,
to
teach
them
war,
at
the
least
such
as
before
knew
nothing
thereof;
003:003
Namely,
five
lords
of
the
Philistines,
and
all
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Sidonians,
and
the
Hivites
that
dwelt
in
mount
Lebanon,
from
mount
Baalhermon
unto
the
entering
in
of
Hamath.
003:004
And
they
were
to
prove
Israel
by
them,
to
know
whether
they
would
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
LORD,
which
he
commanded
their
fathers
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
003:005
And
the
children
of
Israel
dwelt
among
the
Canaanites,
Hittites,
and
Amorites,
and
Perizzites,
and
Hivites,
and
Jebusites:
003:006
And
they
took
their
daughters
to
be
their
wives,
and
gave
their
daughters
to
their
sons,
and
served
their
gods.
003:007
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
forgat
the
LORD
their
God,
and
served
Baalim
and
the
groves.
003:008
Therefore
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
hot
against
Israel,
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
Chushanrishathaim
king
of
Mesopotamia:
and
the
children
of
Israel
served
Chushanrishathaim
eight
years.
003:009
And
when
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
LORD,
the
LORD
raised
up
a
deliverer
to
the
children
of
Israel,
who
delivered
them,
even
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz,
Caleb's
younger
brother.
003:010
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
him,
and
he
judged
Israel,
and
went
out
to
war:
and
the
LORD
delivered
Chushanrishathaim
king
of
Mesopotamia
into
his
hand;
and
his
hand
prevailed
against
Chushanrishathaim.
003:011
And
the
land
had
rest
forty
years.
And
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz
