died.
003:012
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
and
the
LORD
strengthened
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab
against
Israel,
because
they
had
done
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD.
003:013
And
he
gathered
unto
him
the
children
of
Ammon
and
Amalek,
and
went
and
smote
Israel,
and
possessed
the
city
of
palm
trees.
003:014
So
the
children
of
Israel
served
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab
eighteen
years.
003:015
But
when
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
LORD,
the
LORD
raised
them
up
a
deliverer,
Ehud
the
son
of
Gera,
a
Benjamite,
a
man
lefthanded:
and
by
him
the
children
of
Israel
sent
a
present
unto
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab.
003:016
But
Ehud
made
him
a
dagger
which
had
two
edges,
of
a
cubit
length;
and
he
did
gird
it
under
his
raiment
upon
his
right
thigh.
003:017
And
he
brought
the
present
unto
Eglon
king
of
Moab:
and
Eglon
was
a
very
fat
man.
003:018
And
when
he
had
made
an
end
to
offer
the
present,
he
sent
away
the
people
that
bare
the
present.
003:019
But
he
himself
turned
again
from
the
quarries
that
were
by
Gilgal,
and
said,
I
have
a
secret
errand
unto
thee,
O
king:
who
said,
Keep
silence.
And
all
that
stood
by
him
went
out
from
him.
003:020
And
Ehud
came
unto
him;
and
he
was
sitting
in
a
summer
parlour,
which
he
had
for
himself
alone.
And
Ehud
said,
I
have
a
message
from
God
unto
thee.
And
he
arose
out
of
his
seat.
003:021
And
Ehud
put
forth
his
left
hand,
and
took
the
dagger
from
his
right
thigh,
and
thrust
it
into
his
belly:
003:022
And
the
haft
also
went
in
after
the
blade;
and
the
fat
closed
upon
the
blade,
so
that
he
could
not
draw
the
dagger
out
of
his
belly;
and
the
dirt
came
out.
003:023
Then
Ehud
went
forth
through
the
porch,
and
shut
the
doors
of
the
parlour
upon
him,
and
locked
them.
003:024
When
he
was
gone
out,
his
servants
came;
and
when
they
saw
that,
behold,
the
doors
of
the
parlour
were
locked,
they
said,
Surely
he
covereth
his
feet
in
his
summer
chamber.
003:025
And
they
tarried
till
they
were
ashamed:
and,
behold,
he
opened
not
the
doors
of
the
parlour;
therefore
they
took
a
key,
and
opened
them:
and,
behold,
their
lord
was
fallen
down
dead
on
the
earth.
003:026
And
Ehud
escaped
while
they
tarried,
and
passed
beyond
the
quarries,
and
escaped
unto
Seirath.
003:027
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
was
come,
that
he
blew
a
trumpet
in
the
mountain
of
Ephraim,
and
the
children
of
Israel
went
down
with
him
from
the
mount,
and
he
before
them.
003:028
And
he
said
unto
them,
Follow
after
me:
for
the
LORD
hath
delivered
your
enemies
the
Moabites
into
your
hand.
And
they
went
down
after
him,
and
took
the
fords
of
Jordan
toward
Moab,
and
suffered
not
a
man
to
pass
over.
003:029
And
they
slew
of
Moab
at
that
time
about
ten
thousand
men,
all
lusty,
and
all
men
of
valour;
and
there
escaped
not
a
man.
003:030
So
Moab
was
subdued
that
day
under
the
hand
of
Israel.
And
the
land
had
rest
fourscore
years.
003:031
And
after
him
was
Shamgar
the
son
of
Anath,
which
slew
of
the
Philistines
six
hundred
men
with
an
ox
goad:
and
he
also
delivered
Israel.
004:001
And
the
children
of
Israel
again
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
when
Ehud
was
dead.
004:002
And
the
LORD
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
Jabin
king
of
Canaan,
that
reigned
in
Hazor;
the
captain
of
whose
host
was
Sisera,
which
dwelt
in
Harosheth
of
the
Gentiles.
004:003
And
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
LORD:
for
he
had
nine
hundred
chariots
of
iron;
and
twenty
years
he
mightily
oppressed
the
children
of
Israel.
004:004
And
Deborah,
a
prophetess,
the
wife
of
Lapidoth,
she
judged
Israel
at
that
time.
004:005
And
she
dwelt
under
the
palm
tree
of
Deborah
between
Ramah
and
Bethel
in
mount
Ephraim:
and
the
children
of
Israel
came
up
to
her
for
judgment.
004:006
And
she
sent
and
called
Barak
the
son
of
Abinoam
out
of
Kedeshnaphtali,
and
said
unto
him,
Hath
not
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
commanded,
saying,
Go
and
draw
toward
mount
Tabor,
and
take
with
thee
ten
thousand
men
of
the
children
of
Naphtali
and
of
the
children
of
Zebulun?
004:007
And
I
will
draw
unto
thee
to
the
river
Kishon
Sisera,
the
captain
of
Jabin's
army,
with
his
chariots
and
his
multitude;
and
I
will
deliver
him
into
thine
hand.
004:008
And
Barak
said
unto
her,
If
thou
wilt
go
with
me,
then
I
will
go:
but
if
thou
wilt
not
go
with
me,
then
I
will
not
go.
004:009
And
she
said,
I
will
surely
go
with
thee:
notwithstanding
the
journey
that
thou
takest
shall
not
be
for
thine
honour;
for
the
LORD
shall
sell
Sisera
into
the
hand
of
a
woman.
And
Deborah
arose,
and
went
with
Barak
to
Kedesh.
004:010
And
Barak
called
Zebulun
and
Naphtali
to
Kedesh;
and
he
went
up
with
ten
thousand
men
at
his
feet:
and
Deborah
went
up
with
him.
004:011
Now
Heber
the
Kenite,
which
was
of
the
children
of
Hobab
the
father
in
law
of
Moses,
had
severed
himself
from
the
Kenites,
and
pitched
his
tent
unto
the
plain
of
Zaanaim,
which
is
by
Kedesh.
004:012
And
they
shewed
Sisera
that
Barak
the
son
of
Abinoam
was
gone
up
to
mount
Tabor.
004:013
And
Sisera
gathered
together
all
his
chariots,
even
nine
hundred
chariots
of
iron,
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him,
from
Harosheth
of
the
Gentiles
unto
the
river
of
Kishon.
004:014
And
Deborah
said
unto
Barak,
Up;
for
this
is
the
day
in
which
the
LORD
hath
delivered
Sisera
into
thine
hand:
is
not
the
LORD
gone
out
before
thee?
So
Barak
went
down
from
mount
Tabor,
and
ten
thousand
men
after
him.
004:015
And
the
LORD
discomfited
Sisera,
and
all
his
chariots,
and
all
his
host,
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
before
Barak;
so
that
Sisera
lighted
down
off
his
chariot,
and
fled
away
on
his
feet.
004:016
But
Barak
pursued
after
the
chariots,
and
after
the
host,
unto
Harosheth
of
the
Gentiles:
and
all
the
host
of
Sisera
fell
upon
the
edge
of
the
sword;
and
there
was
not
a
man
left.
004:017
Howbeit
Sisera
fled
away
on
his
feet
to
the
tent
of
Jael
the
wife
of
Heber
the
Kenite:
for
there
was
peace
between
Jabin
the
king
of
Hazor
and
the
house
of
Heber
the
Kenite.
004:018
And
Jael
went
out
to
meet
Sisera,
and
said
unto
him,
Turn
in,
my
lord,
turn
in
to
me;
fear
not.
And
when
he
had
turned
in
unto
her
into
the
tent,
she
covered
him
with
a
mantle.
004:019
And
he
said
unto
her,
Give
me,
I
pray
thee,
a
little
water
to
drink;
for
I
am
thirsty.
And
she
opened
a
bottle
of
milk,
and
gave
him
drink,
and
covered
him.
004:020
Again
he
said
unto
her,
Stand
in
the
door
of
the
tent,
and
it
shall
be,
when
any
man
doth
come
and
enquire
of
thee,
and
say,
Is
there
any
man
here?
that
thou
shalt
say,
No.
004:021
Then
Jael
Heber's
wife
took
a
nail
of
the
tent,
and
took
an
hammer
in
her
hand,
and
went
softly
unto
him,
and
smote
the
nail
into
his
temples,
and
fastened
it
into
the
ground:
for
he
was
fast
asleep
and
weary.
So
he
died.
004:022
And,
behold,
as
Barak
pursued
Sisera,
Jael
came
out
to
meet
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Come,
and
I
will
shew
thee
the
man
whom
thou
seekest.
And
when
he
came
into
her
tent,
behold,
Sisera
lay
dead,
and
the
nail
was
in
his
temples.
004:023
So
God
subdued
on
that
day
Jabin
the
king
of
Canaan
before
the
children
of
Israel.
004:024
And
the
hand
of
the
children
of
Israel
prospered,
and
prevailed
against
Jabin
the
king
of
Canaan,
until
they
had
destroyed
Jabin
king
of
Canaan.
005:001
Then
sang
Deborah
and
Barak
the
son
of
Abinoam
on
that
day,
saying,
005:002
Praise
ye
the
LORD
for
the
avenging
of
Israel,
when
the
people
willingly
offered
themselves.
005:003
Hear,
O
ye
kings;
give
ear,
O
ye
princes;
I,
even
I,
will
sing
unto
the
LORD;
I
will
sing
praise
to
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
005:004
LORD,
when
thou
wentest
out
of
Seir,
when
thou
marchedst
out
of
the
field
of
Edom,
the
earth
trembled,
and
the
heavens
dropped,
the
clouds
also
dropped
water.
005:005
The
mountains
melted
from
before
the
LORD,
even
that
Sinai
from
before
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
005:006
In
the
days
of
Shamgar
the
son
of
Anath,
in
the
days
of
Jael,
the
highways
were
unoccupied,
and
the
travellers
walked
through
byways.
005:007
The
inhabitants
of
the
villages
ceased,
they
ceased
in
Israel,
until
that
I
Deborah
arose,
that
I
arose
a
mother
in
Israel.
005:008
They
chose
new
gods;
then
was
war
in
the
gates:
was
there
a
shield
or
spear
seen
among
forty
thousand
in
Israel?
005:009
My
heart
is
toward
the
governors
of
Israel,
that
offered
themselves
willingly
among
the
people.
Bless
ye
the
LORD.
005:010
Speak,
ye
that
ride
on
white
asses,
ye
that
sit
in
judgment,
and
walk
by
the
way.
005:011
They
that
are
delivered
from
the
noise
of
archers
in
the
places
of
drawing
water,
there
shall
they
rehearse
the
righteous
acts
of
the
LORD,
even
the
righteous
acts
toward
the
inhabitants
of
his
villages
in
Israel:
then
shall
the
people
of
the
LORD
go
down
to
the
gates.
005:012
Awake,
awake,
Deborah:
awake,
awake,
utter
a
song:
arise,
Barak,
and
lead
thy
captivity
captive,
thou
son
of
Abinoam.
005:013
Then
he
made
him
that
remaineth
have
dominion
over
the
nobles
among
the
people:
the
LORD
made
me
have
dominion
over
the
mighty.
005:014
Out
of
Ephraim
was
there
a
root
of
them
against
Amalek;
after
thee,
Benjamin,
among
thy
people;
out
of
Machir
came
down
governors,
and
out
of
Zebulun
they
that
handle
the
pen
of
the
writer.
005:015
And
the
princes
of
Issachar
were
with
Deborah;
even
Issachar,
and
also
Barak:
he
was
sent
on
foot
into
the
valley.
For
the
divisions
of
Reuben
there
were
great
thoughts
of
heart.
005:016
Why
abodest
thou
among
the
sheepfolds,
to
hear
the
bleatings
of
the
flocks?
For
the
divisions
of
Reuben
there
were
great
searchings
of
heart.
005:017
Gilead
abode
beyond
Jordan:
and
why
did
Dan
remain
in
ships?
Asher
continued
on
the
sea
shore,
and
abode
in
his
breaches.
005:018
Zebulun
and
Naphtali
were
a
people
that
jeoparded
their
lives
unto
the
death
in
the
high
places
of
the
field.
005:019
The
kings
came
and
fought,
then
fought
the
kings
of
Canaan
in
Taanach
by
the
waters
of
Megiddo;
they
took
no
gain
of
money.
005:020
They
fought
from
heaven;
the
stars
in
their
courses
fought
against
Sisera.
005:021
The
river
of
Kishon
swept
them
away,
that
ancient
river,
the
river
Kishon.
O
my
soul,
thou
hast
trodden
down
strength.
005:022
Then
were
the
horsehoofs
broken
by
the
means
of
the
pransings,
the
pransings
of
their
mighty
ones.
005:023
Curse
ye
Meroz,
said
the
angel
of
the
LORD,
curse
ye
bitterly
the
inhabitants
thereof;
because
they
came
not
to
the
help
of
the
LORD,
to
the
help
of
the
LORD
against
the
mighty.
005:024
Blessed
above
women
shall
Jael
the
wife
of
Heber
the
Kenite
be,
blessed
shall
she
be
above
women
in
the
tent.
005:025
He
asked
water,
and
she
gave
him
milk;
she
brought
forth
butter
in
a
lordly
dish.
005:026
She
put
her
hand
to
the
nail,
and
her
right
hand
to
the
workmen's
hammer;
and
with
the
hammer
she
smote
Sisera,
she
smote
off
his
head,
when
she
had
pierced
and
stricken
through
his
temples.
005:027
At
her
feet
he
bowed,
he
fell,
he
lay
down:
at
her
feet
he
bowed,
he
fell:
where
he
bowed,
there
he
fell
down
dead.
005:028
The
mother
of
Sisera
looked
out
at
a
window,
and
cried
through
the
lattice,
Why
is
his
chariot
so
long
in
coming?
why
tarry
the
wheels
of
his
chariots?
005:029
Her
wise
ladies
answered
her,
yea,
she
returned
answer
to
herself,
005:030
Have
they
not
sped?
have
they
not
divided
the
prey;
to
every
man
a
damsel
or
two;
to
Sisera
a
prey
of
divers
colours,
a
prey
of
divers
colours
of
needlework,
of
divers
colours
of
needlework
on
both
sides,
meet
for
the
necks
of
them
that
take
the
spoil?
005:031
So
let
all
thine
enemies
perish,
O
LORD:
but
let
them
that
love
him
be
as
the
sun
when
he
goeth
forth
in
his
might.
And
the
land
had
rest
forty
years.
006:001
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
and
the
LORD
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
Midian
seven
years.
006:002
And
the
hand
of
Midian
prevailed
against
Israel:
and
because
of
the
Midianites
the
children
of
Israel
made
them
the
dens
which
are
in
the
mountains,
and
caves,
and
strong
holds.
006:003
And
so
it
was,
when
Israel
had
sown,
that
the
Midianites
came
up,
and
the
Amalekites,
and
the
children
of
the
east,
even
they
came
up
against
them;
006:004
And
they
encamped
against
them,
and
destroyed
the
increase
of
the
earth,
till
thou
come
unto
Gaza,
and
left
no
sustenance
for
Israel,
neither
sheep,
nor
ox,
nor
ass.
006:005
For
they
came
up
with
their
cattle
and
their
tents,
and
they
came
as
grasshoppers
for
multitude;
for
both
they
and
their
camels
were
without
number:
and
they
entered
into
the
land
to
destroy
it.
006:006
And
Israel
was
greatly
impoverished
because
of
the
Midianites;
and
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
LORD.
006:007
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
LORD
because
of
the
Midianites,
006:008
That
the
LORD
sent
a
prophet
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
which
said
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
I
brought
you
up
from
Egypt,
and
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
house
of
bondage;
006:009
And
I
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians,
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
that
oppressed
you,
and
drave
them
out
from
before
you,
and
gave
you
their
land;
006:010
And
I
said
unto
you,
I
am
the
LORD
your
God;
fear
not
the
gods
of
the
Amorites,
in
whose
land
ye
dwell:
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice.
006:011
And
there
came
an
angel
of
the
LORD,
and
sat
under
an
oak
which
was
in
Ophrah,
that
pertained
unto
Joash
the
Abiezrite:
and
his
son
Gideon
threshed
wheat
by
the
winepress,
to
hide
it
from
the
Midianites.
006:012
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him,
and
said
unto
him,
The
LORD
is
with
thee,
thou
mighty
man
of
valour.
006:013
And
Gideon
said
unto
him,
Oh
my
Lord,
if
the
LORD
be
with
us,
why
then
is
all
this
befallen
us?
and
where
be
all
his
miracles
which
our
fathers
told
us
of,
saying,
Did
not
the
LORD
bring
us
up
from
Egypt?
but
now
the
LORD
hath
forsaken
us,
and
delivered
us
into
the
hands
of
the
Midianites.
006:014
And
the
LORD
looked
upon
him,
and
said,
Go
in
this
thy
might,
and
thou
shalt
save
Israel
from
the
hand
of
the
Midianites:
have
not
I
sent
thee?
006:015
And
he
said
unto
him,
Oh
my
Lord,
wherewith
shall
I
save
Israel?
behold,
my
family
is
poor
in
Manasseh,
and
I
am
the
least
in
my
father's
house.
006:016
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Surely
I
will
be
with
thee,
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
Midianites
as
one
man.
006:017
And
he
said
unto
him,
If
now
I
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight,
then
shew
me
a
sign
that
thou
talkest
with
me.
006:018
Depart
not
hence,
I
pray
thee,
until
I
come
unto
thee,
and
bring
forth
my
present,
and
set
it
before
thee.
And
he
said,
I
will
tarry
until
thou
come
again.
006:019
And
Gideon
went
in,
and
made
ready
a
kid,
and
unleavened
cakes
of
an
ephah
of
flour:
the
flesh
he
put
in
a
basket,
and
he
put
the
broth
in
a
pot,
and
brought
it
out
unto
him
under
the
oak,
and
presented
it.
006:020
And
the
angel
of
God
said
unto
him,
Take
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes,
and
lay
them
upon
this
rock,
and
pour
out
the
broth.
And
he
did
so.
006:021
Then
the
angel
of
the
LORD
put
forth
the
end
of
the
staff
that
was
in
his
hand,
and
touched
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes;
and
there
rose
up
fire
out
of
the
rock,
and
consumed
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes.
Then
the
angel
of
the
LORD
departed
out
of
his
sight.
006:022
And
when
Gideon
perceived
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
LORD,
Gideon
said,
Alas,
O
LORD
God!
for
because
I
have
seen
an
angel
of
the
LORD
face
to
face.
006:023
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Peace
be
unto
thee;
fear
not:
thou
shalt
not
die.
006:024
Then
Gideon
built
an
altar
there
unto
the
LORD,
and
called
it
Jehovahshalom:
unto
this
day
it
is
yet
in
Ophrah
of
the
Abiezrites.
006:025
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night,
that
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Take
thy
father's
young
bullock,
even
the
second
bullock
of
seven
years
old,
and
throw
down
the
altar
of
Baal
that
thy
father
hath,
and
cut
down
the
grove
that
is
by
it:
006:026
And
build
an
altar
unto
the
LORD
thy
God
upon
the
top
of
this
rock,
in
the
ordered
place,
and
take
the
second
bullock,
and
offer
a
burnt
sacrifice
with
the
wood
of
the
grove
which
thou
shalt
cut
down.
006:027
Then
Gideon
took
ten
men
of
his
servants,
and
did
as
the
LORD
had
said
unto
him:
and
so
it
was,
because
he
feared
his
father's
household,
and
the
men
of
the
city,
that
he
could
not
do
it
by
day,
that
he
did
it
by
night.
006:028
And
when
the
men
of
the
city
arose
early
in
the
morning,
behold,
the
altar
of
Baal
was
cast
down,
and
the
grove
was
cut
down
that
was
by
it,
and
the
second
bullock
was
offered
upon
the
altar
that
was
built.
006:029
And
they
said
one
to
another,
Who
hath
done
this
thing?
And
when
they
enquired
and
asked,
they
said,
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
hath
done
this
thing.
006:030
Then
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
Joash,
Bring
out
thy
son,
that
he
may
die:
because
he
hath
cast
down
the
altar
of
Baal,
and
because
he
hath
cut
down
the
grove
that
was
by
it.
006:031
And
Joash
said
unto
all
that
stood
against
him,
Will
ye
plead
for
Baal?
will
ye
save
him?
he
that
will
plead
for
him,
let
him
be
put
to
death
whilst
it
is
yet
morning:
if
he
be
a
god,
let
him
plead
for
himself,
because
one
hath
cast
down
his
altar.
006:032
Therefore
on
that
day
he
called
him
Jerubbaal,
saying,
Let
Baal
plead
against
him,
because
he
hath
thrown
down
his
altar.
006:033
Then
all
the
Midianites
and
the
Amalekites
and
the
children
of
the
east
were
gathered
together,
and
went
over,
and
pitched
in
the
valley
of
Jezreel.
006:034
But
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
Gideon,
and
he
blew
a
trumpet;
and
Abiezer
was
gathered
after
him.
006:035
And
he
sent
messengers
throughout
all
Manasseh;
who
also
was
gathered
after
him:
and
he
sent
messengers
unto
Asher,
and
unto
Zebulun,
and
unto
Naphtali;
and
they
came
up
to
meet
them.
006:036
And
Gideon
said
unto
God,
If
thou
wilt
save
Israel
by
mine
hand,
as
thou
hast
said,
006:037
Behold,
I
will
put
a
fleece
of
wool
in
the
floor;
and
if
the
dew
be
on
the
fleece
only,
and
it
be
dry
upon
all
the
earth
beside,
then
shall
I
know
that
thou
wilt
save
Israel
by
mine
hand,
as
thou
hast
said.
006:038
And
it
was
so:
for
he
rose
up
early
on
the
morrow,
and
thrust
the
fleece
together,
and
wringed
the
dew
out
of
the
fleece,
a
bowl
full
of
water.
006:039
And
Gideon
said
unto
God,
Let
not
thine
anger
be
hot
against
me,
and
I
will
speak
but
this
once:
let
me
prove,
I
pray
thee,
but
this
once
with
the
fleece;
let
it
now
be
dry
only
upon
the
fleece,
and
upon
all
the
ground
let
there
be
dew.
006:040
And
God
did
so
that
night:
for
it
was
dry
upon
the
fleece
only,
and
there
was
dew
on
all
the
ground.
007:001
Then
Jerubbaal,
who
is
Gideon,
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him,
rose
up
early,
and
pitched
beside
the
well
of
Harod:
so
that
the
host
of
the
Midianites
were
on
the
north
side
of
them,
by
the
hill
of
Moreh,
in
the
valley.
007:002
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Gideon,
The
people
that
are
with
thee
are
too
many
for
me
to
give
the
Midianites
into
their
hands,
lest
Israel
vaunt
themselves
against
me,
saying,
Mine
own
hand
hath
saved
me.
007:003
Now
therefore
go
to,
proclaim
in
the
ears
of
the
people,
saying,
Whosoever
is
fearful
and
afraid,
let
him
return
and
depart
early
from
mount
Gilead.
And
there
returned
of
the
people
twenty
and
two
thousand;
and
there
remained
ten
thousand.
007:004
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Gideon,
The
people
are
yet
too
many;
bring
them
down
unto
the
water,
and
I
will
try
them
for
thee
there:
and
it
shall
be,
that
of
whom
I
say
unto
thee,
This
shall
go
with
thee,
the
same
shall
go
with
thee;
and
of
whomsoever
I
say
unto
thee,
This
shall
not
go
with
thee,
the
same
shall
not
go.
007:005
So
he
brought
down
the
people
unto
the
water:
and
the
LORD
said
unto
Gideon,
Every
one
that
lappeth
of
the
water
with
his
tongue,
as
a
dog
lappeth,
him
shalt
thou
set
by
himself;
likewise
every
one
that
boweth
down
upon
his
knees
to
drink.
007:006
And
the
number
of
them
that
lapped,
putting
their
hand
to
their
mouth,
were
three
hundred
men:
but
all
the
rest
of
the
people
bowed
down
upon
their
knees
to
drink
water.
007:007
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Gideon,
By
the
three
hundred
men
that
lapped
will
I
save
you,
and
deliver
the
Midianites
into
thine
hand:
and
let
all
the
other
people
go
every
man
unto
his
place.
007:008
So
the
people
took
victuals
in
their
hand,
and
their
trumpets:
and
he
sent
all
the
rest
of
Israel
every
man
unto
his
tent,
and
retained
those
three
hundred
men:
and
the
host
of
Midian
was
beneath
him
in
the
valley.
007:009
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night,
that
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Arise,
get
thee
down
unto
the
host;
for
I
have
delivered
it
into
thine
hand.
007:010
But
if
thou
fear
to
go
down,
go
thou
with
Phurah
thy
servant
down
to
the
host:
007:011
And
thou
shalt
hear
what
they
say;
and
afterward
shall
thine
hands
be
strengthened
to
go
down
unto
the
host.
Then
went
he
down
with
Phurah
his
servant
unto
the
outside
of
the
armed
men
that
were
in
the
host.
007:012
And
the
Midianites
and
the
Amalekites
and
all
the
children
of
the
east
lay
along
in
the
valley
like
grasshoppers
for
multitude;
and
their
camels
were
without
number,
as
the
sand
by
the
sea
side
for
multitude.
007:013
And
when
Gideon
was
come,
behold,
there
was
a
man
that
told
a
dream
unto
his
fellow,
and
said,
Behold,
I
dreamed
a
dream,
and,
lo,
a
cake
of
barley
bread
tumbled
into
the
host
of
Midian,
and
came
unto
a
tent,
and
smote
it
that
it
fell,
and
overturned
it,
that
the
tent
lay
along.
007:014
And
his
fellow
answered
and
said,
This
is
nothing
else
save
the
sword
of
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash,
a
man
of
Israel:
for
into
his
hand
hath
God
delivered
Midian,
and
all
the
host.
007:015
And
it
was
so,
when
Gideon
heard
the
telling
of
the
dream,
and
the
interpretation
thereof,
that
he
worshipped,
and
returned
into
the
host
of
Israel,
and
said,
Arise;
for
the
LORD
hath
delivered
into
your
hand
the
host
of
Midian.
007:016
