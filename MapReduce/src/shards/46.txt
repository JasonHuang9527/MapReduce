And
he
divided
the
three
hundred
men
into
three
companies,
and
he
put
a
trumpet
in
every
man's
hand,
with
empty
pitchers,
and
lamps
within
the
pitchers.
007:017
And
he
said
unto
them,
Look
on
me,
and
do
likewise:
and,
behold,
when
I
come
to
the
outside
of
the
camp,
it
shall
be
that,
as
I
do,
so
shall
ye
do.
007:018
When
I
blow
with
a
trumpet,
I
and
all
that
are
with
me,
then
blow
ye
the
trumpets
also
on
every
side
of
all
the
camp,
and
say,
The
sword
of
the
LORD,
and
of
Gideon.
007:019
So
Gideon,
and
the
hundred
men
that
were
with
him,
came
unto
the
outside
of
the
camp
in
the
beginning
of
the
middle
watch;
and
they
had
but
newly
set
the
watch:
and
they
blew
the
trumpets,
and
brake
the
pitchers
that
were
in
their
hands.
007:020
And
the
three
companies
blew
the
trumpets,
and
brake
the
pitchers,
and
held
the
lamps
in
their
left
hands,
and
the
trumpets
in
their
right
hands
to
blow
withal:
and
they
cried,
The
sword
of
the
LORD,
and
of
Gideon.
007:021
And
they
stood
every
man
in
his
place
round
about
the
camp;
and
all
the
host
ran,
and
cried,
and
fled.
007:022
And
the
three
hundred
blew
the
trumpets,
and
the
LORD
set
every
man's
sword
against
his
fellow,
even
throughout
all
the
host:
and
the
host
fled
to
Bethshittah
in
Zererath,
and
to
the
border
of
Abelmeholah,
unto
Tabbath.
007:023
And
the
men
of
Israel
gathered
themselves
together
out
of
Naphtali,
and
out
of
Asher,
and
out
of
all
Manasseh,
and
pursued
after
the
Midianites.
007:024
And
Gideon
sent
messengers
throughout
all
mount
Ephraim,
saying,
come
down
against
the
Midianites,
and
take
before
them
the
waters
unto
Bethbarah
and
Jordan.
Then
all
the
men
of
Ephraim
gathered
themselves
together,
and
took
the
waters
unto
Bethbarah
and
Jordan.
007:025
And
they
took
two
princes
of
the
Midianites,
Oreb
and
Zeeb;
and
they
slew
Oreb
upon
the
rock
Oreb,
and
Zeeb
they
slew
at
the
winepress
of
Zeeb,
and
pursued
Midian,
and
brought
the
heads
of
Oreb
and
Zeeb
to
Gideon
on
the
other
side
Jordan.
008:001
And
the
men
of
Ephraim
said
unto
him,
Why
hast
thou
served
us
thus,
that
thou
calledst
us
not,
when
thou
wentest
to
fight
with
the
Midianites?
And
they
did
chide
with
him
sharply.
008:002
And
he
said
unto
them,
What
have
I
done
now
in
comparison
of
you?
Is
not
the
gleaning
of
the
grapes
of
Ephraim
better
than
the
vintage
of
Abiezer?
008:003
God
hath
delivered
into
your
hands
the
princes
of
Midian,
Oreb
and
Zeeb:
and
what
was
I
able
to
do
in
comparison
of
you?
Then
their
anger
was
abated
toward
him,
when
he
had
said
that.
008:004
And
Gideon
came
to
Jordan,
and
passed
over,
he,
and
the
three
hundred
men
that
were
with
him,
faint,
yet
pursuing
them.
008:005
And
he
said
unto
the
men
of
Succoth,
Give,
I
pray
you,
loaves
of
bread
unto
the
people
that
follow
me;
for
they
be
faint,
and
I
am
pursuing
after
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
kings
of
Midian.
008:006
And
the
princes
of
Succoth
said,
Are
the
hands
of
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
now
in
thine
hand,
that
we
should
give
bread
unto
thine
army?
008:007
And
Gideon
said,
Therefore
when
the
LORD
hath
delivered
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
into
mine
hand,
then
I
will
tear
your
flesh
with
the
thorns
of
the
wilderness
and
with
briers.
008:008
And
he
went
up
thence
to
Penuel,
and
spake
unto
them
likewise:
and
the
men
of
Penuel
answered
him
as
the
men
of
Succoth
had
answered
him.
008:009
And
he
spake
also
unto
the
men
of
Penuel,
saying,
When
I
come
again
in
peace,
I
will
break
down
this
tower.
008:010
Now
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
were
in
Karkor,
and
their
hosts
with
them,
about
fifteen
thousand
men,
all
that
were
left
of
all
the
hosts
of
the
children
of
the
east:
for
there
fell
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
that
drew
sword.
008:011
And
Gideon
went
up
by
the
way
of
them
that
dwelt
in
tents
on
the
east
of
Nobah
and
Jogbehah,
and
smote
the
host;
for
the
host
was
secure.
008:012
And
when
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
fled,
he
pursued
after
them,
and
took
the
two
kings
of
Midian,
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
and
discomfited
all
the
host.
008:013
And
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
returned
from
battle
before
the
sun
was
up,
008:014
And
caught
a
young
man
of
the
men
of
Succoth,
and
enquired
of
him:
and
he
described
unto
him
the
princes
of
Succoth,
and
the
elders
thereof,
even
threescore
and
seventeen
men.
008:015
And
he
came
unto
the
men
of
Succoth,
and
said,
Behold
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
with
whom
ye
did
upbraid
me,
saying,
Are
the
hands
of
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
now
in
thine
hand,
that
we
should
give
bread
unto
thy
men
that
are
weary?
008:016
And
he
took
the
elders
of
the
city,
and
thorns
of
the
wilderness
and
briers,
and
with
them
he
taught
the
men
of
Succoth.
008:017
And
he
beat
down
the
tower
of
Penuel,
and
slew
the
men
of
the
city.
008:018
Then
said
he
unto
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
What
manner
of
men
were
they
whom
ye
slew
at
Tabor?
And
they
answered,
As
thou
art,
so
were
they;
each
one
resembled
the
children
of
a
king.
008:019
And
he
said,
They
were
my
brethren,
even
the
sons
of
my
mother:
as
the
LORD
liveth,
if
ye
had
saved
them
alive,
I
would
not
slay
you.
008:020
And
he
said
unto
Jether
his
firstborn,
Up,
and
slay
them.
But
the
youth
drew
not
his
sword:
for
he
feared,
because
he
was
yet
a
youth.
008:021
Then
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
said,
Rise
thou,
and
fall
upon
us:
for
as
the
man
is,
so
is
his
strength.
And
Gideon
arose,
and
slew
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
and
took
away
the
ornaments
that
were
on
their
camels'
necks.
008:022
Then
the
men
of
Israel
said
unto
Gideon,
Rule
thou
over
us,
both
thou,
and
thy
son,
and
thy
son's
son
also:
for
thou
hast
delivered
us
from
the
hand
of
Midian.
008:023
And
Gideon
said
unto
them,
I
will
not
rule
over
you,
neither
shall
my
son
rule
over
you:
the
LORD
shall
rule
over
you.
008:024
And
Gideon
said
unto
them,
I
would
desire
a
request
of
you,
that
ye
would
give
me
every
man
the
earrings
of
his
prey.
(For
they
had
golden
earrings,
because
they
were
Ishmaelites.)
008:025
And
they
answered,
We
will
willingly
give
them.
And
they
spread
a
garment,
and
did
cast
therein
every
man
the
earrings
of
his
prey.
008:026
And
the
weight
of
the
golden
earrings
that
he
requested
was
a
thousand
and
seven
hundred
shekels
of
gold;
beside
ornaments,
and
collars,
and
purple
raiment
that
was
on
the
kings
of
Midian,
and
beside
the
chains
that
were
about
their
camels'
necks.
008:027
And
Gideon
made
an
ephod
thereof,
and
put
it
in
his
city,
even
in
Ophrah:
and
all
Israel
went
thither
a
whoring
after
it:
which
thing
became
a
snare
unto
Gideon,
and
to
his
house.
008:028
Thus
was
Midian
subdued
before
the
children
of
Israel,
so
that
they
lifted
up
their
heads
no
more.
And
the
country
was
in
quietness
forty
years
in
the
days
of
Gideon.
008:029
And
Jerubbaal
the
son
of
Joash
went
and
dwelt
in
his
own
house.
008:030
And
Gideon
had
threescore
and
ten
sons
of
his
body
begotten:
for
he
had
many
wives.
008:031
And
his
concubine
that
was
in
Shechem,
she
also
bare
him
a
son,
whose
name
he
called
Abimelech.
008:032
And
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
died
in
a
good
old
age,
and
was
buried
in
the
sepulchre
of
Joash
his
father,
in
Ophrah
of
the
Abiezrites.
008:033
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
soon
as
Gideon
was
dead,
that
the
children
of
Israel
turned
again,
and
went
a
whoring
after
Baalim,
and
made
Baalberith
their
god.
008:034
And
the
children
of
Israel
remembered
not
the
LORD
their
God,
who
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
all
their
enemies
on
every
side:
008:035
Neither
shewed
they
kindness
to
the
house
of
Jerubbaal,
namely,
Gideon,
according
to
all
the
goodness
which
he
had
shewed
unto
Israel.
009:001
And
Abimelech
the
son
of
Jerubbaal
went
to
Shechem
unto
his
mother's
brethren,
and
communed
with
them,
and
with
all
the
family
of
the
house
of
his
mother's
father,
saying,
009:002
Speak,
I
pray
you,
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
Shechem,
Whether
is
better
for
you,
either
that
all
the
sons
of
Jerubbaal,
which
are
threescore
and
ten
persons,
reign
over
you,
or
that
one
reign
over
you?
remember
also
that
I
am
your
bone
and
your
flesh.
009:003
And
his
mother's
brethren
spake
of
him
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
Shechem
all
these
words:
and
their
hearts
inclined
to
follow
Abimelech;
for
they
said,
He
is
our
brother.
009:004
And
they
gave
him
threescore
and
ten
pieces
of
silver
out
of
the
house
of
Baalberith,
wherewith
Abimelech
hired
vain
and
light
persons,
which
followed
him.
009:005
And
he
went
unto
his
father's
house
at
Ophrah,
and
slew
his
brethren
the
sons
of
Jerubbaal,
being
threescore
and
ten
persons,
upon
one
stone:
notwithstanding
yet
Jotham
the
youngest
son
of
Jerubbaal
was
left;
for
he
hid
himself.
009:006
And
all
the
men
of
Shechem
gathered
together,
and
all
the
house
of
Millo,
and
went,
and
made
Abimelech
king,
by
the
plain
of
the
pillar
that
was
in
Shechem.
009:007
And
when
they
told
it
to
Jotham,
he
went
and
stood
in
the
top
of
mount
Gerizim,
and
lifted
up
his
voice,
and
cried,
and
said
unto
them,
Hearken
unto
me,
ye
men
of
Shechem,
that
God
may
hearken
unto
you.
009:008
The
trees
went
forth
on
a
time
to
anoint
a
king
over
them;
and
they
said
unto
the
olive
tree,
Reign
thou
over
us.
009:009
But
the
olive
tree
said
unto
them,
Should
I
leave
my
fatness,
wherewith
by
me
they
honour
God
and
man,
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees?
009:010
And
the
trees
said
to
the
fig
tree,
Come
thou,
and
reign
over
us.
009:011
But
the
fig
tree
said
unto
them,
Should
I
forsake
my
sweetness,
and
my
good
fruit,
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees?
009:012
Then
said
the
trees
unto
the
vine,
Come
thou,
and
reign
over
us.
009:013
And
the
vine
said
unto
them,
Should
I
leave
my
wine,
which
cheereth
God
and
man,
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees?
009:014
Then
said
all
the
trees
unto
the
bramble,
Come
thou,
and
reign
over
us.
009:015
And
the
bramble
said
unto
the
trees,
If
in
truth
ye
anoint
me
king
over
you,
then
come
and
put
your
trust
in
my
shadow:
and
if
not,
let
fire
come
out
of
the
bramble,
and
devour
the
cedars
of
Lebanon.
009:016
Now
therefore,
if
ye
have
done
truly
and
sincerely,
in
that
ye
have
made
Abimelech
king,
and
if
ye
have
dealt
well
with
Jerubbaal
and
his
house,
and
have
done
unto
him
according
to
the
deserving
of
his
hands;
009:017
(For
my
father
fought
for
you,
and
adventured
his
life
far,
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
Midian:
009:018
And
ye
are
risen
up
against
my
father's
house
this
day,
and
have
slain
his
sons,
threescore
and
ten
persons,
upon
one
stone,
and
have
made
Abimelech,
the
son
of
his
maidservant,
king
over
the
men
of
Shechem,
because
he
is
your
brother;)
009:019
If
ye
then
have
dealt
truly
and
sincerely
with
Jerubbaal
and
with
his
house
this
day,
then
rejoice
ye
in
Abimelech,
and
let
him
also
rejoice
in
you:
009:020
But
if
not,
let
fire
come
out
from
Abimelech,
and
devour
the
men
of
Shechem,
and
the
house
of
Millo;
and
let
fire
come
out
from
the
men
of
Shechem,
and
from
the
house
of
Millo,
and
devour
Abimelech.
009:021
And
Jotham
ran
away,
and
fled,
and
went
to
Beer,
and
dwelt
there,
for
fear
of
Abimelech
his
brother.
009:022
When
Abimelech
had
reigned
three
years
over
Israel,
009:023
Then
God
sent
an
evil
spirit
between
Abimelech
and
the
men
of
Shechem;
and
the
men
of
Shechem
dealt
treacherously
with
Abimelech:
009:024
That
the
cruelty
done
to
the
threescore
and
ten
sons
of
Jerubbaal
might
come,
and
their
blood
be
laid
upon
Abimelech
their
brother,
which
slew
them;
and
upon
the
men
of
Shechem,
which
aided
him
in
the
killing
of
his
brethren.
009:025
And
the
men
of
Shechem
set
liers
in
wait
for
him
in
the
top
of
the
mountains,
and
they
robbed
all
that
came
along
that
way
by
them:
and
it
was
told
Abimelech.
009:026
And
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
came
with
his
brethren,
and
went
over
to
Shechem:
and
the
men
of
Shechem
put
their
confidence
in
him.
009:027
And
they
went
out
into
the
fields,
and
gathered
their
vineyards,
and
trode
the
grapes,
and
made
merry,
and
went
into
the
house
of
their
god,
and
did
eat
and
drink,
and
cursed
Abimelech.
009:028
And
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
said,
Who
is
Abimelech,
and
who
is
Shechem,
that
we
should
serve
him?
is
not
he
the
son
of
Jerubbaal?
and
Zebul
his
officer?
serve
the
men
of
Hamor
the
father
of
Shechem:
for
why
should
we
serve
him?
009:029
And
would
to
God
this
people
were
under
my
hand!
then
would
I
remove
Abimelech.
And
he
said
to
Abimelech,
Increase
thine
army,
and
come
out.
009:030
And
when
Zebul
the
ruler
of
the
city
heard
the
words
of
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed,
his
anger
was
kindled.
009:031
And
he
sent
messengers
unto
Abimelech
privily,
saying,
Behold,
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
and
his
brethren
be
come
to
Shechem;
and,
behold,
they
fortify
the
city
against
thee.
009:032
Now
therefore
up
by
night,
thou
and
the
people
that
is
with
thee,
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
field:
009:033
And
it
shall
be,
that
in
the
morning,
as
soon
as
the
sun
is
up,
thou
shalt
rise
early,
and
set
upon
the
city:
and,
behold,
when
he
and
the
people
that
is
with
him
come
out
against
thee,
then
mayest
thou
do
to
them
as
thou
shalt
find
occasion.
009:034
And
Abimelech
rose
up,
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him,
by
night,
and
they
laid
wait
against
Shechem
in
four
companies.
009:035
And
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
went
out,
and
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city:
and
Abimelech
rose
up,
and
the
people
that
were
with
him,
from
lying
in
wait.
009:036
And
when
Gaal
saw
the
people,
he
said
to
Zebul,
Behold,
there
come
people
down
from
the
top
of
the
mountains.
And
Zebul
said
unto
him,
Thou
seest
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
as
if
they
were
men.
009:037
And
Gaal
spake
again,
and
said,
See
there
come
people
down
by
the
middle
of
the
land,
and
another
company
come
along
by
the
plain
of
Meonenim.
009:038
Then
said
Zebul
unto
him,
Where
is
now
thy
mouth,
wherewith
thou
saidst,
Who
is
Abimelech,
that
we
should
serve
him?
is
not
this
the
people
that
thou
hast
despised?
go
out,
I
pray
now,
and
fight
with
them.
009:039
And
Gaal
went
out
before
the
men
of
Shechem,
and
fought
with
Abimelech.
009:040
And
Abimelech
chased
him,
and
he
fled
before
him,
and
many
were
overthrown
and
wounded,
even
unto
the
entering
of
the
gate.
009:041
And
Abimelech
dwelt
at
Arumah:
and
Zebul
thrust
out
Gaal
and
his
brethren,
that
they
should
not
dwell
in
Shechem.
009:042
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
the
people
went
out
into
the
field;
and
they
told
Abimelech.
009:043
And
he
took
the
people,
and
divided
them
into
three
companies,
and
laid
wait
in
the
field,
and
looked,
and,
behold,
the
people
were
come
forth
out
of
the
city;
and
he
rose
up
against
them,
and
smote
them.
009:044
And
Abimelech,
and
the
company
that
was
with
him,
rushed
forward,
and
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city:
and
the
two
other
companies
ran
upon
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
fields,
and
slew
them.
009:045
And
Abimelech
fought
against
the
city
all
that
day;
and
he
took
the
city,
and
slew
the
people
that
was
therein,
and
beat
down
the
city,
and
sowed
it
with
salt.
009:046
And
when
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
heard
that,
they
entered
into
an
hold
of
the
house
of
the
god
Berith.
009:047
And
it
was
told
Abimelech,
that
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
were
gathered
together.
009:048
And
Abimelech
gat
him
up
to
mount
Zalmon,
he
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him;
and
Abimelech
took
an
axe
in
his
hand,
and
cut
down
a
bough
from
the
trees,
and
took
it,
and
laid
it
on
his
shoulder,
and
said
unto
the
people
that
were
with
him,
What
ye
have
seen
me
do,
make
haste,
and
do
as
I
have
done.
009:049
And
all
the
people
likewise
cut
down
every
man
his
bough,
and
followed
Abimelech,
and
put
them
to
the
hold,
and
set
the
hold
on
fire
upon
them;
so
that
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
died
also,
about
a
thousand
men
and
women.
009:050
Then
went
Abimelech
to
Thebez,
and
encamped
against
Thebez,
and
took
it.
009:051
But
there
was
a
strong
tower
within
the
city,
and
thither
fled
all
the
men
and
women,
and
all
they
of
the
city,
and
shut
it
to
them,
and
gat
them
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower.
009:052
And
Abimelech
came
unto
the
tower,
and
fought
against
it,
and
went
hard
unto
the
door
of
the
tower
to
burn
it
with
fire.
009:053
And
a
certain
woman
cast
a
piece
of
a
millstone
upon
Abimelech's
head,
and
all
to
brake
his
skull.
009:054
Then
he
called
hastily
unto
the
young
man
his
armourbearer,
and
said
unto
him,
Draw
thy
sword,
and
slay
me,
that
men
say
not
of
me,
A
women
slew
him.
And
his
young
man
thrust
him
through,
and
he
died.
009:055
And
when
the
men
of
Israel
saw
that
Abimelech
was
dead,
they
departed
every
man
unto
his
place.
009:056
Thus
God
rendered
the
wickedness
of
Abimelech,
which
he
did
unto
his
father,
in
slaying
his
seventy
brethren:
009:057
And
all
the
evil
of
the
men
of
Shechem
did
God
render
upon
their
heads:
and
upon
them
came
the
curse
of
Jotham
the
son
of
Jerubbaal.
010:001
And
after
Abimelech
there
arose
to
defend
Israel
Tola
the
son
of
Puah,
the
son
of
Dodo,
a
man
of
Issachar;
and
he
dwelt
in
Shamir
in
mount
Ephraim.
010:002
And
he
judged
Israel
twenty
and
three
years,
and
died,
and
was
buried
in
Shamir.
010:003
And
after
him
arose
Jair,
a
Gileadite,
and
judged
Israel
twenty
and
two
years.
010:004
And
he
had
thirty
sons
that
rode
on
thirty
ass
colts,
and
they
had
thirty
cities,
which
are
called
Havothjair
unto
this
day,
which
are
in
the
land
of
Gilead.
010:005
And
Jair
died,
and
was
buried
in
Camon.
010:006
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
served
Baalim,
and
Ashtaroth,
and
the
gods
of
Syria,
and
the
gods
of
Zidon,
and
the
gods
of
Moab,
and
the
gods
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
the
gods
of
the
Philistines,
and
forsook
the
LORD,
and
served
not
him.
010:007
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
hot
against
Israel,
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
the
Philistines,
and
into
the
hands
of
the
children
of
Ammon.
010:008
And
that
year
they
vexed
and
oppressed
the
children
of
Israel:
eighteen
years,
all
the
children
of
Israel
that
were
on
the
other
side
Jordan
in
the
land
of
the
Amorites,
which
is
in
Gilead.
010:009
Moreover
the
children
of
Ammon
passed
over
Jordan
to
fight
also
against
Judah,
and
against
Benjamin,
and
against
the
house
of
Ephraim;
so
that
Israel
was
sore
distressed.
010:010
And
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
LORD,
saying,
We
have
sinned
against
thee,
both
because
we
have
forsaken
our
God,
and
also
served
Baalim.
010:011
And
the
LORD
said
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
Did
not
I
deliver
you
from
the
Egyptians,
and
from
the
Amorites,
from
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
from
the
Philistines?
010:012
The
Zidonians
also,
and
the
Amalekites,
and
the
Maonites,
did
oppress
you;
and
ye
cried
to
me,
and
I
delivered
you
out
of
their
hand.
010:013
Yet
ye
have
forsaken
me,
and
served
other
gods:
wherefore
I
will
deliver
you
no
more.
010:014
Go
and
cry
unto
the
gods
which
ye
have
chosen;
let
them
deliver
you
in
the
time
of
your
tribulation.
010:015
And
the
children
of
Israel
said
unto
the
LORD,
We
have
sinned:
do
thou
unto
us
whatsoever
seemeth
good
unto
thee;
deliver
us
only,
we
pray
thee,
this
day.
010:016
And
they
put
away
the
strange
gods
from
among
them,
and
served
the
LORD:
and
his
soul
was
grieved
for
the
misery
of
Israel.
010:017
Then
the
children
of
Ammon
were
gathered
together,
and
encamped
in
Gilead.
And
the
children
of
Israel
assembled
themselves
together,
and
encamped
in
Mizpeh.
010:018
And
the
people
and
princes
of
Gilead
said
one
to
another,
What
man
is
he
that
will
begin
to
fight
against
the
children
of
Ammon?
he
shall
be
head
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
Gilead.
011:001
Now
Jephthah
the
Gileadite
was
a
mighty
man
of
valour,
and
he
was
the
son
of
an
harlot:
and
Gilead
begat
Jephthah.
011:002
And
Gilead's
wife
bare
him
sons;
and
his
wife's
sons
grew
up,
and
they
thrust
out
Jephthah,
and
said
unto
him,
Thou
shalt
not
inherit
in
our
father's
house;
for
thou
art
the
son
of
a
strange
woman.
011:003
Then
Jephthah
fled
from
his
brethren,
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
Tob:
and
there
were
gathered
vain
men
to
Jephthah,
and
went
out
with
him.
011:004
And
it
came
to
pass
in
process
of
time,
that
the
children
of
Ammon
made
war
against
Israel.
011:005
And
it
was
so,
that
when
the
children
of
Ammon
made
war
against
Israel,
the
elders
of
Gilead
went
to
fetch
Jephthah
out
of
the
land
of
Tob:
011:006
And
they
said
unto
Jephthah,
Come,
and
be
our
captain,
that
we
may
fight
with
the
children
of
Ammon.
011:007
And
Jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
Gilead,
Did
not
ye
hate
me,
and
expel
me
out
of
my
father's
house?
and
why
are
ye
come
unto
me
now
when
ye
are
in
distress?
011:008
And
the
elders
of
Gilead
said
unto
Jephthah,
Therefore
we
turn
again
to
thee
now,
that
thou
mayest
go
with
us,
and
fight
against
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
be
our
head
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
Gilead.
011:009
And
Jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
Gilead,
If
ye
bring
me
home
again
to
fight
against
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
the
LORD
deliver
them
before
me,
shall
I
be
your
head?
011:010
And
the
elders
of
Gilead
said
unto
Jephthah,
The
LORD
be
witness
between
us,
if
we
do
not
so
according
to
thy
words.
011:011
Then
Jephthah
went
with
the
elders
of
Gilead,
and
the
people
made
him
head
and
captain
over
them:
and
Jephthah
uttered
all
his
words
before
the
LORD
in
Mizpeh.
011:012
And
Jephthah
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
saying,
What
hast
thou
to
do
with
me,
that
thou
art
come
against
me
to
fight
in
my
land?
011:013
And
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon
answered
unto
the
messengers
of
Jephthah,
Because
Israel
took
away
my
land,
when
they
came
up
out
of
Egypt,
from
Arnon
even
unto
Jabbok,
and
unto
Jordan:
now
therefore
restore
those
lands
again
peaceably.
011:014
And
Jephthah
sent
messengers
again
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon:
011:015
And
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
Jephthah,
Israel
took
not
away
the
land
of
Moab,
nor
the
land
of
the
children
of
Ammon:
011:016
But
when
Israel
came
up
from
Egypt,
and
walked
through
the
wilderness
unto
the
Red
sea,
and
came
to
Kadesh;
011:017
Then
Israel
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
Edom,
saying,
Let
me,
I
pray
thee,
pass
through
thy
land:
but
the
king
of
Edom
would
not
hearken
thereto.
And
in
like
manner
they
sent
unto
the
king
of
Moab:
but
he
would
not
