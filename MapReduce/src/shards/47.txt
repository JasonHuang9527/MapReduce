consent:
and
Israel
abode
in
Kadesh.
011:018
Then
they
went
along
through
the
wilderness,
and
compassed
the
land
of
Edom,
and
the
land
of
Moab,
and
came
by
the
east
side
of
the
land
of
Moab,
and
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
Arnon,
but
came
not
within
the
border
of
Moab:
for
Arnon
was
the
border
of
Moab.
011:019
And
Israel
sent
messengers
unto
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
the
king
of
Heshbon;
and
Israel
said
unto
him,
Let
us
pass,
we
pray
thee,
through
thy
land
into
my
place.
011:020
But
Sihon
trusted
not
Israel
to
pass
through
his
coast:
but
Sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together,
and
pitched
in
Jahaz,
and
fought
against
Israel.
011:021
And
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
delivered
Sihon
and
all
his
people
into
the
hand
of
Israel,
and
they
smote
them:
so
Israel
possessed
all
the
land
of
the
Amorites,
the
inhabitants
of
that
country.
011:022
And
they
possessed
all
the
coasts
of
the
Amorites,
from
Arnon
even
unto
Jabbok,
and
from
the
wilderness
even
unto
Jordan.
011:023
So
now
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
hath
dispossessed
the
Amorites
from
before
his
people
Israel,
and
shouldest
thou
possess
it?
011:024
Wilt
not
thou
possess
that
which
Chemosh
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess?
So
whomsoever
the
LORD
our
God
shall
drive
out
from
before
us,
them
will
we
possess.
011:025
And
now
art
thou
any
thing
better
than
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor,
king
of
Moab?
did
he
ever
strive
against
Israel,
or
did
he
ever
fight
against
them,
011:026
While
Israel
dwelt
in
Heshbon
and
her
towns,
and
in
Aroer
and
her
towns,
and
in
all
the
cities
that
be
along
by
the
coasts
of
Arnon,
three
hundred
years?
why
therefore
did
ye
not
recover
them
within
that
time?
011:027
Wherefore
I
have
not
sinned
against
thee,
but
thou
doest
me
wrong
to
war
against
me:
the
LORD
the
Judge
be
judge
this
day
between
the
children
of
Israel
and
the
children
of
Ammon.
011:028
Howbeit
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
of
Jephthah
which
he
sent
him.
011:029
Then
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
Jephthah,
and
he
passed
over
Gilead,
and
Manasseh,
and
passed
over
Mizpeh
of
Gilead,
and
from
Mizpeh
of
Gilead
he
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
Ammon.
011:030
And
Jephthah
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
LORD,
and
said,
If
thou
shalt
without
fail
deliver
the
children
of
Ammon
into
mine
hands,
011:031
Then
it
shall
be,
that
whatsoever
cometh
forth
of
the
doors
of
my
house
to
meet
me,
when
I
return
in
peace
from
the
children
of
Ammon,
shall
surely
be
the
LORD's,
and
I
will
offer
it
up
for
a
burnt
offering.
011:032
So
Jephthah
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
Ammon
to
fight
against
them;
and
the
LORD
delivered
them
into
his
hands.
011:033
And
he
smote
them
from
Aroer,
even
till
thou
come
to
Minnith,
even
twenty
cities,
and
unto
the
plain
of
the
vineyards,
with
a
very
great
slaughter.
Thus
the
children
of
Ammon
were
subdued
before
the
children
of
Israel.
011:034
And
Jephthah
came
to
Mizpeh
unto
his
house,
and,
behold,
his
daughter
came
out
to
meet
him
with
timbrels
and
with
dances:
and
she
was
his
only
child;
beside
her
he
had
neither
son
nor
daughter.
011:035
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
saw
her,
that
he
rent
his
clothes,
and
said,
Alas,
my
daughter!
thou
hast
brought
me
very
low,
and
thou
art
one
of
them
that
trouble
me:
for
I
have
opened
my
mouth
unto
the
LORD,
and
I
cannot
go
back.
011:036
And
she
said
unto
him,
My
father,
if
thou
hast
opened
thy
mouth
unto
the
LORD,
do
to
me
according
to
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
thy
mouth;
forasmuch
as
the
LORD
hath
taken
vengeance
for
thee
of
thine
enemies,
even
of
the
children
of
Ammon.
011:037
And
she
said
unto
her
father,
Let
this
thing
be
done
for
me:
let
me
alone
two
months,
that
I
may
go
up
and
down
upon
the
mountains,
and
bewail
my
virginity,
I
and
my
fellows.
011:038
And
he
said,
Go.
And
he
sent
her
away
for
two
months:
and
she
went
with
her
companions,
and
bewailed
her
virginity
upon
the
mountains.
011:039
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
months,
that
she
returned
unto
her
father,
who
did
with
her
according
to
his
vow
which
he
had
vowed:
and
she
knew
no
man.
And
it
was
a
custom
in
Israel,
011:040
That
the
daughters
of
Israel
went
yearly
to
lament
the
daughter
of
Jephthah
the
Gileadite
four
days
in
a
year.
012:001
And
the
men
of
Ephraim
gathered
themselves
together,
and
went
northward,
and
said
unto
Jephthah,
Wherefore
passedst
thou
over
to
fight
against
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
didst
not
call
us
to
go
with
thee?
we
will
burn
thine
house
upon
thee
with
fire.
012:002
And
Jephthah
said
unto
them,
I
and
my
people
were
at
great
strife
with
the
children
of
Ammon;
and
when
I
called
you,
ye
delivered
me
not
out
of
their
hands.
012:003
And
when
I
saw
that
ye
delivered
me
not,
I
put
my
life
in
my
hands,
and
passed
over
against
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
the
LORD
delivered
them
into
my
hand:
wherefore
then
are
ye
come
up
unto
me
this
day,
to
fight
against
me?
012:004
Then
Jephthah
gathered
together
all
the
men
of
Gilead,
and
fought
with
Ephraim:
and
the
men
of
Gilead
smote
Ephraim,
because
they
said,
Ye
Gileadites
are
fugitives
of
Ephraim
among
the
Ephraimites,
and
among
the
Manassites.
012:005
And
the
Gileadites
took
the
passages
of
Jordan
before
the
Ephraimites:
and
it
was
so,
that
when
those
Ephraimites
which
were
escaped
said,
Let
me
go
over;
that
the
men
of
Gilead
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
an
Ephraimite?
If
he
said,
Nay;
012:006
Then
said
they
unto
him,
Say
now
Shibboleth:
and
he
said
Sibboleth:
for
he
could
not
frame
to
pronounce
it
right.
Then
they
took
him,
and
slew
him
at
the
passages
of
Jordan:
and
there
fell
at
that
time
of
the
Ephraimites
forty
and
two
thousand.
012:007
And
Jephthah
judged
Israel
six
years.
Then
died
Jephthah
the
Gileadite,
and
was
buried
in
one
of
the
cities
of
Gilead.
012:008
And
after
him
Ibzan
of
Bethlehem
judged
Israel.
012:009
And
he
had
thirty
sons,
and
thirty
daughters,
whom
he
sent
abroad,
and
took
in
thirty
daughters
from
abroad
for
his
sons.
And
he
judged
Israel
seven
years.
012:010
Then
died
Ibzan,
and
was
buried
at
Bethlehem.
012:011
And
after
him
Elon,
a
Zebulonite,
judged
Israel;
and
he
judged
Israel
ten
years.
012:012
And
Elon
the
Zebulonite
died,
and
was
buried
in
Aijalon
in
the
country
of
Zebulun.
012:013
And
after
him
Abdon
the
son
of
Hillel,
a
Pirathonite,
judged
Israel.
012:014
And
he
had
forty
sons
and
thirty
nephews,
that
rode
on
threescore
and
ten
ass
colts:
and
he
judged
Israel
eight
years.
012:015
And
Abdon
the
son
of
Hillel
the
Pirathonite
died,
and
was
buried
in
Pirathon
in
the
land
of
Ephraim,
in
the
mount
of
the
Amalekites.
013:001
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD;
and
the
LORD
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
forty
years.
013:002
And
there
was
a
certain
man
of
Zorah,
of
the
family
of
the
Danites,
whose
name
was
Manoah;
and
his
wife
was
barren,
and
bare
not.
013:003
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
the
woman,
and
said
unto
her,
Behold
now,
thou
art
barren,
and
bearest
not:
but
thou
shalt
conceive,
and
bear
a
son.
013:004
Now
therefore
beware,
I
pray
thee,
and
drink
not
wine
nor
strong
drink,
and
eat
not
any
unclean
thing:
013:005
For,
lo,
thou
shalt
conceive,
and
bear
a
son;
and
no
razor
shall
come
on
his
head:
for
the
child
shall
be
a
Nazarite
unto
God
from
the
womb:
and
he
shall
begin
to
deliver
Israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines.
013:006
Then
the
woman
came
and
told
her
husband,
saying,
A
man
of
God
came
unto
me,
and
his
countenance
was
like
the
countenance
of
an
angel
of
God,
very
terrible:
but
I
asked
him
not
whence
he
was,
neither
told
he
me
his
name:
013:007
But
he
said
unto
me,
Behold,
thou
shalt
conceive,
and
bear
a
son;
and
now
drink
no
wine
nor
strong
drink,
neither
eat
any
unclean
thing:
for
the
child
shall
be
a
Nazarite
to
God
from
the
womb
to
the
day
of
his
death.
013:008
Then
Manoah
intreated
the
LORD,
and
said,
O
my
Lord,
let
the
man
of
God
which
thou
didst
send
come
again
unto
us,
and
teach
us
what
we
shall
do
unto
the
child
that
shall
be
born.
013:009
And
God
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
Manoah;
and
the
angel
of
God
came
again
unto
the
woman
as
she
sat
in
the
field:
but
Manoah
her
husband
was
not
with
her.
013:010
And
the
woman
made
haste,
and
ran,
and
shewed
her
husband,
and
said
unto
him,
Behold,
the
man
hath
appeared
unto
me,
that
came
unto
me
the
other
day.
013:011
And
Manoah
arose,
and
went
after
his
wife,
and
came
to
the
man,
and
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
the
man
that
spakest
unto
the
woman?
And
he
said,
I
am.
013:012
And
Manoah
said,
Now
let
thy
words
come
to
pass.
How
shall
we
order
the
child,
and
how
shall
we
do
unto
him?
013:013
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
Manoah,
Of
all
that
I
said
unto
the
woman
let
her
beware.
013:014
She
may
not
eat
of
any
thing
that
cometh
of
the
vine,
neither
let
her
drink
wine
or
strong
drink,
nor
eat
any
unclean
thing:
all
that
I
commanded
her
let
her
observe.
013:015
And
Manoah
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
LORD,
I
pray
thee,
let
us
detain
thee,
until
we
shall
have
made
ready
a
kid
for
thee.
013:016
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
Manoah,
Though
thou
detain
me,
I
will
not
eat
of
thy
bread:
and
if
thou
wilt
offer
a
burnt
offering,
thou
must
offer
it
unto
the
LORD.
For
Manoah
knew
not
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
LORD.
013:017
And
Manoah
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
LORD,
What
is
thy
name,
that
when
thy
sayings
come
to
pass
we
may
do
thee
honour?
013:018
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Why
askest
thou
thus
after
my
name,
seeing
it
is
secret?
013:019
So
Manoah
took
a
kid
with
a
meat
offering,
and
offered
it
upon
a
rock
unto
the
LORD:
and
the
angel
did
wonderously;
and
Manoah
and
his
wife
looked
on.
013:020
For
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
flame
went
up
toward
heaven
from
off
the
altar,
that
the
angel
of
the
LORD
ascended
in
the
flame
of
the
altar.
And
Manoah
and
his
wife
looked
on
it,
and
fell
on
their
faces
to
the
ground.
013:021
But
the
angel
of
the
LORD
did
no
more
appear
to
Manoah
and
to
his
wife.
Then
Manoah
knew
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
LORD.
013:022
And
Manoah
said
unto
his
wife,
We
shall
surely
die,
because
we
have
seen
God.
013:023
But
his
wife
said
unto
him,
If
the
LORD
were
pleased
to
kill
us,
he
would
not
have
received
a
burnt
offering
and
a
meat
offering
at
our
hands,
neither
would
he
have
shewed
us
all
these
things,
nor
would
as
at
this
time
have
told
us
such
things
as
these.
013:024
And
the
woman
bare
a
son,
and
called
his
name
Samson:
and
the
child
grew,
and
the
LORD
blessed
him.
013:025
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
began
to
move
him
at
times
in
the
camp
of
Dan
between
Zorah
and
Eshtaol.
014:001
And
Samson
went
down
to
Timnath,
and
saw
a
woman
in
Timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
Philistines.
014:002
And
he
came
up,
and
told
his
father
and
his
mother,
and
said,
I
have
seen
a
woman
in
Timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
Philistines:
now
therefore
get
her
for
me
to
wife.
014:003
Then
his
father
and
his
mother
said
unto
him,
Is
there
never
a
woman
among
the
daughters
of
thy
brethren,
or
among
all
my
people,
that
thou
goest
to
take
a
wife
of
the
uncircumcised
Philistines?
And
Samson
said
unto
his
father,
Get
her
for
me;
for
she
pleaseth
me
well.
014:004
But
his
father
and
his
mother
knew
not
that
it
was
of
the
LORD,
that
he
sought
an
occasion
against
the
Philistines:
for
at
that
time
the
Philistines
had
dominion
over
Israel.
014:005
Then
went
Samson
down,
and
his
father
and
his
mother,
to
Timnath,
and
came
to
the
vineyards
of
Timnath:
and,
behold,
a
young
lion
roared
against
him.
014:006
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
mightily
upon
him,
and
he
rent
him
as
he
would
have
rent
a
kid,
and
he
had
nothing
in
his
hand:
but
he
told
not
his
father
or
his
mother
what
he
had
done.
014:007
And
he
went
down,
and
talked
with
the
woman;
and
she
pleased
Samson
well.
014:008
And
after
a
time
he
returned
to
take
her,
and
he
turned
aside
to
see
the
carcase
of
the
lion:
and,
behold,
there
was
a
swarm
of
bees
and
honey
in
the
carcase
of
the
lion.
014:009
And
he
took
thereof
in
his
hands,
and
went
on
eating,
and
came
to
his
father
and
mother,
and
he
gave
them,
and
they
did
eat:
but
he
told
not
them
that
he
had
taken
the
honey
out
of
the
carcase
of
the
lion.
014:010
So
his
father
went
down
unto
the
woman:
and
Samson
made
there
a
feast;
for
so
used
the
young
men
to
do.
014:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
saw
him,
that
they
brought
thirty
companions
to
be
with
him.
014:012
And
Samson
said
unto
them,
I
will
now
put
forth
a
riddle
unto
you:
if
ye
can
certainly
declare
it
me
within
the
seven
days
of
the
feast,
and
find
it
out,
then
I
will
give
you
thirty
sheets
and
thirty
change
of
garments:
014:013
But
if
ye
cannot
declare
it
me,
then
shall
ye
give
me
thirty
sheets
and
thirty
change
of
garments.
And
they
said
unto
him,
Put
forth
thy
riddle,
that
we
may
hear
it.
014:014
And
he
said
unto
them,
Out
of
the
eater
came
forth
meat,
and
out
of
the
strong
came
forth
sweetness.
And
they
could
not
in
three
days
expound
the
riddle.
014:015
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day,
that
they
said
unto
Samson's
wife,
Entice
thy
husband,
that
he
may
declare
unto
us
the
riddle,
lest
we
burn
thee
and
thy
father's
house
with
fire:
have
ye
called
us
to
take
that
we
have?
is
it
not
so?
014:016
And
Samson's
wife
wept
before
him,
and
said,
Thou
dost
but
hate
me,
and
lovest
me
not:
thou
hast
put
forth
a
riddle
unto
the
children
of
my
people,
and
hast
not
told
it
me.
And
he
said
unto
her,
Behold,
I
have
not
told
it
my
father
nor
my
mother,
and
shall
I
tell
it
thee?
014:017
And
she
wept
before
him
the
seven
days,
while
their
feast
lasted:
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day,
that
he
told
her,
because
she
lay
sore
upon
him:
and
she
told
the
riddle
to
the
children
of
her
people.
014:018
And
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
him
on
the
seventh
day
before
the
sun
went
down,
What
is
sweeter
than
honey?
And
what
is
stronger
than
a
lion?
and
he
said
unto
them,
If
ye
had
not
plowed
with
my
heifer,
ye
had
not
found
out
my
riddle.
014:019
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
him,
and
he
went
down
to
Ashkelon,
and
slew
thirty
men
of
them,
and
took
their
spoil,
and
gave
change
of
garments
unto
them
which
expounded
the
riddle.
And
his
anger
was
kindled,
and
he
went
up
to
his
father's
house.
014:020
But
Samson's
wife
was
given
to
his
companion,
whom
he
had
used
as
his
friend.
015:001
But
it
came
to
pass
within
a
while
after,
in
the
time
of
wheat
harvest,
that
Samson
visited
his
wife
with
a
kid;
and
he
said,
I
will
go
in
to
my
wife
into
the
chamber.
But
her
father
would
not
suffer
him
to
go
in.
015:002
And
her
father
said,
I
verily
thought
that
thou
hadst
utterly
hated
her;
therefore
I
gave
her
to
thy
companion:
is
not
her
younger
sister
fairer
than
she?
take
her,
I
pray
thee,
instead
of
her.
015:003
And
Samson
said
concerning
them,
Now
shall
I
be
more
blameless
than
the
Philistines,
though
I
do
them
a
displeasure.
015:004
And
Samson
went
and
caught
three
hundred
foxes,
and
took
firebrands,
and
turned
tail
to
tail,
and
put
a
firebrand
in
the
midst
between
two
tails.
015:005
And
when
he
had
set
the
brands
on
fire,
he
let
them
go
into
the
standing
corn
of
the
Philistines,
and
burnt
up
both
the
shocks,
and
also
the
standing
corn,
with
the
vineyards
and
olives.
015:006
Then
the
Philistines
said,
Who
hath
done
this?
And
they
answered,
Samson,
the
son
in
law
of
the
Timnite,
because
he
had
taken
his
wife,
and
given
her
to
his
companion.
And
the
Philistines
came
up,
and
burnt
her
and
her
father
with
fire.
015:007
And
Samson
said
unto
them,
Though
ye
have
done
this,
yet
will
I
be
avenged
of
you,
and
after
that
I
will
cease.
015:008
And
he
smote
them
hip
and
thigh
with
a
great
slaughter:
and
he
went
down
and
dwelt
in
the
top
of
the
rock
Etam.
015:009
Then
the
Philistines
went
up,
and
pitched
in
Judah,
and
spread
themselves
in
Lehi.
015:010
And
the
men
of
Judah
said,
Why
are
ye
come
up
against
us?
And
they
answered,
To
bind
Samson
are
we
come
up,
to
do
to
him
as
he
hath
done
to
us.
015:011
Then
three
thousand
men
of
Judah
went
to
the
top
of
the
rock
Etam,
and
said
to
Samson,
Knowest
thou
not
that
the
Philistines
are
rulers
over
us?
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
unto
us?
And
he
said
unto
them,
As
they
did
unto
me,
so
have
I
done
unto
them.
015:012
And
they
said
unto
him,
We
are
come
down
to
bind
thee,
that
we
may
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines.
And
Samson
said
unto
them,
Swear
unto
me,
that
ye
will
not
fall
upon
me
yourselves.
015:013
And
they
spake
unto
him,
saying,
No;
but
we
will
bind
thee
fast,
and
deliver
thee
into
their
hand:
but
surely
we
will
not
kill
thee.
And
they
bound
him
with
two
new
cords,
and
brought
him
up
from
the
rock.
015:014
And
when
he
came
unto
Lehi,
the
Philistines
shouted
against
him:
and
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
mightily
upon
him,
and
the
cords
that
were
upon
his
arms
became
as
flax
that
was
burnt
with
fire,
and
his
bands
loosed
from
off
his
hands.
015:015
And
he
found
a
new
jawbone
of
an
ass,
and
put
forth
his
hand,
and
took
it,
and
slew
a
thousand
men
therewith.
015:016
And
Samson
said,
With
the
jawbone
of
an
ass,
heaps
upon
heaps,
with
the
jaw
of
an
ass
have
I
slain
a
thousand
men.
015:017
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking,
that
he
cast
away
the
jawbone
out
of
his
hand,
and
called
that
place
Ramathlehi.
015:018
And
he
was
sore
athirst,
and
called
on
the
LORD,
and
said,
Thou
hast
given
this
great
deliverance
into
the
hand
of
thy
servant:
and
now
shall
I
die
for
thirst,
and
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
uncircumcised?
015:019
But
God
clave
an
hollow
place
that
was
in
the
jaw,
and
there
came
water
thereout;
and
when
he
had
drunk,
his
spirit
came
again,
and
he
revived:
wherefore
he
called
the
name
thereof
Enhakkore,
which
is
in
Lehi
unto
this
day.
015:020
And
he
judged
Israel
in
the
days
of
the
Philistines
twenty
years.
016:001
Then
went
Samson
to
Gaza,
and
saw
there
an
harlot,
and
went
in
unto
her.
016:002
And
it
was
told
the
Gazites,
saying,
Samson
is
come
hither.
And
they
compassed
him
in,
and
laid
wait
for
him
all
night
in
the
gate
of
the
city,
and
were
quiet
all
the
night,
saying,
In
the
morning,
when
it
is
day,
we
shall
kill
him.
016:003
And
Samson
lay
till
midnight,
and
arose
at
midnight,
and
took
the
doors
of
the
gate
of
the
city,
and
the
two
posts,
and
went
away
with
them,
bar
and
all,
and
put
them
upon
his
shoulders,
and
carried
them
up
to
the
top
of
an
hill
that
is
before
Hebron.
016:004
And
it
came
to
pass
afterward,
that
he
loved
a
woman
in
the
valley
of
Sorek,
whose
name
was
Delilah.
016:005
And
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
came
up
unto
her,
and
said
unto
her,
Entice
him,
and
see
wherein
his
great
strength
lieth,
and
by
what
means
we
may
prevail
against
him,
that
we
may
bind
him
to
afflict
him;
and
we
will
give
thee
every
one
of
us
eleven
hundred
pieces
of
silver.
016:006
And
Delilah
said
to
Samson,
Tell
me,
I
pray
thee,
wherein
thy
great
strength
lieth,
and
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound
to
afflict
thee.
016:007
And
Samson
said
unto
her,
If
they
bind
me
with
seven
green
withs
that
were
never
dried,
then
shall
I
be
weak,
and
be
as
another
man.
016:008
Then
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
brought
up
to
her
seven
green
withs
which
had
not
been
dried,
and
she
bound
him
with
them.
016:009
Now
there
were
men
lying
in
wait,
abiding
with
her
in
the
chamber.
And
she
said
unto
him,
The
Philistines
be
upon
thee,
Samson.
And
he
brake
the
withs,
as
a
thread
of
tow
is
broken
when
it
toucheth
the
fire.
So
his
strength
was
not
known.
016:010
And
Delilah
said
unto
Samson,
Behold,
thou
hast
mocked
me,
and
told
me
lies:
now
tell
me,
I
pray
thee,
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound.
016:011
And
he
said
unto
her,
If
they
bind
me
fast
with
new
ropes
that
never
were
occupied,
then
shall
I
be
weak,
and
be
as
another
man.
016:012
Delilah
therefore
took
new
ropes,
and
bound
him
therewith,
and
said
unto
him,
The
Philistines
be
upon
thee,
Samson.
And
there
were
liers
in
wait
abiding
in
the
chamber.
And
he
brake
them
from
off
his
arms
like
a
thread.
016:013
And
Delilah
said
unto
Samson,
Hitherto
thou
hast
mocked
me,
and
told
me
lies:
tell
me
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound.
And
he
said
unto
her,
If
thou
weavest
the
seven
locks
of
my
head
with
the
web.
016:014
And
she
fastened
it
with
the
pin,
and
said
unto
him,
The
Philistines
be
upon
thee,
Samson.
And
he
awaked
out
of
his
sleep,
and
went
away
with
the
pin
of
the
beam,
and
with
the
web.
016:015
And
she
said
unto
him,
How
canst
thou
say,
I
love
thee,
when
thine
heart
is
not
with
me?
thou
hast
mocked
me
these
three
times,
and
hast
not
told
me
wherein
thy
great
strength
lieth.
016:016
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
she
pressed
him
daily
with
her
words,
and
urged
him,
so
that
his
soul
was
vexed
unto
death;
016:017
That
he
told
her
all
his
heart,
and
said
unto
her,
There
hath
not
come
a
razor
upon
mine
head;
for
I
have
been
a
Nazarite
unto
God
from
my
mother's
womb:
if
I
be
shaven,
then
my
strength
will
go
from
me,
and
I
shall
become
weak,
and
be
like
any
other
man.
016:018
And
when
Delilah
saw
that
he
had
told
her
all
his
heart,
she
sent
and
called
for
the
lords
of
the
Philistines,
saying,
Come
up
this
once,
for
he
hath
shewed
me
all
his
heart.
Then
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
came
up
unto
her,
and
brought
money
in
their
hand.
016:019
And
she
made
him
sleep
upon
her
knees;
and
she
called
for
a
man,
and
she
caused
him
to
shave
off
the
seven
locks
of
his
head;
and
she
began
to
afflict
him,
and
his
strength
went
from
him.
016:020
And
she
said,
The
Philistines
be
upon
thee,
Samson.
And
he
awoke
out
of
his
sleep,
and
said,
I
will
