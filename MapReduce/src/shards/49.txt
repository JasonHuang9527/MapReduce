Benjamites
that
day
twenty
and
five
thousand
and
an
hundred
men:
all
these
drew
the
sword.
020:036
So
the
children
of
Benjamin
saw
that
they
were
smitten:
for
the
men
of
Israel
gave
place
to
the
Benjamites,
because
they
trusted
unto
the
liers
in
wait
which
they
had
set
beside
Gibeah.
020:037
And
the
liers
in
wait
hasted,
and
rushed
upon
Gibeah;
and
the
liers
in
wait
drew
themselves
along,
and
smote
all
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword.
020:038
Now
there
was
an
appointed
sign
between
the
men
of
Israel
and
the
liers
in
wait,
that
they
should
make
a
great
flame
with
smoke
rise
up
out
of
the
city.
020:039
And
when
the
men
of
Israel
retired
in
the
battle,
Benjamin
began
to
smite
and
kill
of
the
men
of
Israel
about
thirty
persons:
for
they
said,
Surely
they
are
smitten
down
before
us,
as
in
the
first
battle.
020:040
But
when
the
flame
began
to
arise
up
out
of
the
city
with
a
pillar
of
smoke,
the
Benjamites
looked
behind
them,
and,
behold,
the
flame
of
the
city
ascended
up
to
heaven.
020:041
And
when
the
men
of
Israel
turned
again,
the
men
of
Benjamin
were
amazed:
for
they
saw
that
evil
was
come
upon
them.
020:042
Therefore
they
turned
their
backs
before
the
men
of
Israel
unto
the
way
of
the
wilderness;
but
the
battle
overtook
them;
and
them
which
came
out
of
the
cities
they
destroyed
in
the
midst
of
them.
020:043
Thus
they
inclosed
the
Benjamites
round
about,
and
chased
them,
and
trode
them
down
with
ease
over
against
Gibeah
toward
the
sunrising.
020:044
And
there
fell
of
Benjamin
eighteen
thousand
men;
all
these
were
men
of
valour.
020:045
And
they
turned
and
fled
toward
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
of
Rimmon:
and
they
gleaned
of
them
in
the
highways
five
thousand
men;
and
pursued
hard
after
them
unto
Gidom,
and
slew
two
thousand
men
of
them.
020:046
So
that
all
which
fell
that
day
of
Benjamin
were
twenty
and
five
thousand
men
that
drew
the
sword;
all
these
were
men
of
valour.
020:047
But
six
hundred
men
turned
and
fled
to
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
Rimmon,
and
abode
in
the
rock
Rimmon
four
months.
020:048
And
the
men
of
Israel
turned
again
upon
the
children
of
Benjamin,
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
as
well
the
men
of
every
city,
as
the
beast,
and
all
that
came
to
hand:
also
they
set
on
fire
all
the
cities
that
they
came
to.
021:001
Now
the
men
of
Israel
had
sworn
in
Mizpeh,
saying,
There
shall
not
any
of
us
give
his
daughter
unto
Benjamin
to
wife.
021:002
And
the
people
came
to
the
house
of
God,
and
abode
there
till
even
before
God,
and
lifted
up
their
voices,
and
wept
sore;
021:003
And
said,
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
why
is
this
come
to
pass
in
Israel,
that
there
should
be
to
day
one
tribe
lacking
in
Israel?
021:004
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
the
people
rose
early,
and
built
there
an
altar,
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings.
021:005
And
the
children
of
Israel
said,
Who
is
there
among
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
that
came
not
up
with
the
congregation
unto
the
LORD?
For
they
had
made
a
great
oath
concerning
him
that
came
not
up
to
the
LORD
to
Mizpeh,
saying,
He
shall
surely
be
put
to
death.
021:006
And
the
children
of
Israel
repented
them
for
Benjamin
their
brother,
and
said,
There
is
one
tribe
cut
off
from
Israel
this
day.
021:007
How
shall
we
do
for
wives
for
them
that
remain,
seeing
we
have
sworn
by
the
LORD
that
we
will
not
give
them
of
our
daughters
to
wives?
021:008
And
they
said,
What
one
is
there
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
that
came
not
up
to
Mizpeh
to
the
LORD?
And,
behold,
there
came
none
to
the
camp
from
Jabeshgilead
to
the
assembly.
021:009
For
the
people
were
numbered,
and,
behold,
there
were
none
of
the
inhabitants
of
Jabeshgilead
there.
021:010
And
the
congregation
sent
thither
twelve
thousand
men
of
the
valiantest,
and
commanded
them,
saying,
Go
and
smite
the
inhabitants
of
Jabeshgilead
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
with
the
women
and
the
children.
021:011
And
this
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do,
Ye
shall
utterly
destroy
every
male,
and
every
woman
that
hath
lain
by
man.
021:012
And
they
found
among
the
inhabitants
of
Jabeshgilead
four
hundred
young
virgins,
that
had
known
no
man
by
lying
with
any
male:
and
they
brought
them
unto
the
camp
to
Shiloh,
which
is
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
021:013
And
the
whole
congregation
sent
some
to
speak
to
the
children
of
Benjamin
that
were
in
the
rock
Rimmon,
and
to
call
peaceably
unto
them.
021:014
And
Benjamin
came
again
at
that
time;
and
they
gave
them
wives
which
they
had
saved
alive
of
the
women
of
Jabeshgilead:
and
yet
so
they
sufficed
them
not.
021:015
And
the
people
repented
them
for
Benjamin,
because
that
the
LORD
had
made
a
breach
in
the
tribes
of
Israel.
021:016
Then
the
elders
of
the
congregation
said,
How
shall
we
do
for
wives
for
them
that
remain,
seeing
the
women
are
destroyed
out
of
Benjamin?
021:017
And
they
said,
There
must
be
an
inheritance
for
them
that
be
escaped
of
Benjamin,
that
a
tribe
be
not
destroyed
out
of
Israel.
021:018
Howbeit
we
may
not
give
them
wives
of
our
daughters:
for
the
children
of
Israel
have
sworn,
saying,
Cursed
be
he
that
giveth
a
wife
to
Benjamin.
021:019
Then
they
said,
Behold,
there
is
a
feast
of
the
LORD
in
Shiloh
yearly
in
a
place
which
is
on
the
north
side
of
Bethel,
on
the
east
side
of
the
highway
that
goeth
up
from
Bethel
to
Shechem,
and
on
the
south
of
Lebonah.
021:020
Therefore
they
commanded
the
children
of
Benjamin,
saying,
Go
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
vineyards;
021:021
And
see,
and,
behold,
if
the
daughters
of
Shiloh
come
out
to
dance
in
dances,
then
come
ye
out
of
the
vineyards,
and
catch
you
every
man
his
wife
of
the
daughters
of
Shiloh,
and
go
to
the
land
of
Benjamin.
021:022
And
it
shall
be,
when
their
fathers
or
their
brethren
come
unto
us
to
complain,
that
we
will
say
unto
them,
Be
favourable
unto
them
for
our
sakes:
because
we
reserved
not
to
each
man
his
wife
in
the
war:
for
ye
did
not
give
unto
them
at
this
time,
that
ye
should
be
guilty.
021:023
And
the
children
of
Benjamin
did
so,
and
took
them
wives,
according
to
their
number,
of
them
that
danced,
whom
they
caught:
and
they
went
and
returned
unto
their
inheritance,
and
repaired
the
cities,
and
dwelt
in
them.
021:024
And
the
children
of
Israel
departed
thence
at
that
time,
every
man
to
his
tribe
and
to
his
family,
and
they
went
out
from
thence
every
man
to
his
inheritance.
021:025
In
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
Israel:
every
man
did
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes.
Book
08	Ruth
001:001
Now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
when
the
judges
ruled,
that
there
was
a
famine
in
the
land.
And
a
certain
man
of
Bethlehemjudah
went
to
sojourn
in
the
country
of
Moab,
he,
and
his
wife,
and
his
two
sons.
001:002
And
the
name
of
the
man
was
Elimelech,
and
the
name
of
his
wife
Naomi,
and
the
name
of
his
two
sons
Mahlon
and
Chilion,
Ephrathites
of
Bethlehemjudah.
And
they
came
into
the
country
of
Moab,
and
continued
there.
001:003
And
Elimelech
Naomi's
husband
died;
and
she
was
left,
and
her
two
sons.
001:004
And
they
took
them
wives
of
the
women
of
Moab;
the
name
of
the
one
was
Orpah,
and
the
name
of
the
other
Ruth:
and
they
dwelled
there
about
ten
years.
001:005
And
Mahlon
and
Chilion
died
also
both
of
them;
and
the
woman
was
left
of
her
two
sons
and
her
husband.
001:006
Then
she
arose
with
her
daughters
in
law,
that
she
might
return
from
the
country
of
Moab:
for
she
had
heard
in
the
country
of
Moab
how
that
the
LORD
had
visited
his
people
in
giving
them
bread.
001:007
Wherefore
she
went
forth
out
of
the
place
where
she
was,
and
her
two
daughters
in
law
with
her;
and
they
went
on
the
way
to
return
unto
the
land
of
Judah.
001:008
And
Naomi
said
unto
her
two
daughters
in
law,
Go,
return
each
to
her
mother's
house:
the
LORD
deal
kindly
with
you,
as
ye
have
dealt
with
the
dead,
and
with
me.
001:009
The
LORD
grant
you
that
ye
may
find
rest,
each
of
you
in
the
house
of
her
husband.
Then
she
kissed
them;
and
they
lifted
up
their
voice,
and
wept.
001:010
And
they
said
unto
her,
Surely
we
will
return
with
thee
unto
thy
people.
001:011
And
Naomi
said,
Turn
again,
my
daughters:
why
will
ye
go
with
me?
are
there
yet
any
more
sons
in
my
womb,
that
they
may
be
your
husbands?
001:012
Turn
again,
my
daughters,
go
your
way;
for
I
am
too
old
to
have
an
husband.
If
I
should
say,
I
have
hope,
if
I
should
have
an
husband
also
to
night,
and
should
also
bear
sons;
001:013
Would
ye
tarry
for
them
till
they
were
grown?
would
ye
stay
for
them
from
having
husbands?
nay,
my
daughters;
for
it
grieveth
me
much
for
your
sakes
that
the
hand
of
the
LORD
is
gone
out
against
me.
001:014
And
they
lifted
up
their
voice,
and
wept
again:
and
Orpah
kissed
her
mother
in
law;
but
Ruth
clave
unto
her.
001:015
And
she
said,
Behold,
thy
sister
in
law
is
gone
back
unto
her
people,
and
unto
her
gods:
return
thou
after
thy
sister
in
law.
001:016
And
Ruth
said,
Intreat
me
not
to
leave
thee,
or
to
return
from
following
after
thee:
for
whither
thou
goest,
I
will
go;
and
where
thou
lodgest,
I
will
lodge:
thy
people
shall
be
my
people,
and
thy
God
my
God:
001:017
Where
thou
diest,
will
I
die,
and
there
will
I
be
buried:
the
LORD
do
so
to
me,
and
more
also,
if
ought
but
death
part
thee
and
me.
001:018
When
she
saw
that
she
was
stedfastly
minded
to
go
with
her,
then
she
left
speaking
unto
her.
001:019
So
they
two
went
until
they
came
to
Bethlehem.
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
were
come
to
Bethlehem,
that
all
the
city
was
moved
about
them,
and
they
said,
Is
this
Naomi?
001:020
And
she
said
unto
them,
Call
me
not
Naomi,
call
me
Mara:
for
the
Almighty
hath
dealt
very
bitterly
with
me.
001:021
I
went
out
full
and
the
LORD
hath
brought
me
home
again
empty:
why
then
call
ye
me
Naomi,
seeing
the
LORD
hath
testified
against
me,
and
the
Almighty
hath
afflicted
me?
001:022
So
Naomi
returned,
and
Ruth
the
Moabitess,
her
daughter
in
law,
with
her,
which
returned
out
of
the
country
of
Moab:
and
they
came
to
Bethlehem
in
the
beginning
of
barley
harvest.
002:001
And
Naomi
had
a
kinsman
of
her
husband's,
a
mighty
man
of
wealth,
of
the
family
of
Elimelech;
and
his
name
was
Boaz.
002:002
And
Ruth
the
Moabitess
said
unto
Naomi,
Let
me
now
go
to
the
field,
and
glean
ears
of
corn
after
him
in
whose
sight
I
shall
find
grace.
And
she
said
unto
her,
Go,
my
daughter.
002:003
And
she
went,
and
came,
and
gleaned
in
the
field
after
the
reapers:
and
her
hap
was
to
light
on
a
part
of
the
field
belonging
unto
Boaz,
who
was
of
the
kindred
of
Elimelech.
002:004
And,
behold,
Boaz
came
from
Bethlehem,
and
said
unto
the
reapers,
The
LORD
be
with
you.
And
they
answered
him,
The
LORD
bless
thee.
002:005
Then
said
Boaz
unto
his
servant
that
was
set
over
the
reapers,
Whose
damsel
is
this?
002:006
And
the
servant
that
was
set
over
the
reapers
answered
and
said,
It
is
the
Moabitish
damsel
that
came
back
with
Naomi
out
of
the
country
of
Moab:
002:007
And
she
said,
I
pray
you,
let
me
glean
and
gather
after
the
reapers
among
the
sheaves:
so
she
came,
and
hath
continued
even
from
the
morning
until
now,
that
she
tarried
a
little
in
the
house.
002:008
Then
said
Boaz
unto
Ruth,
Hearest
thou
not,
my
daughter?
Go
not
to
glean
in
another
field,
neither
go
from
hence,
but
abide
here
fast
by
my
maidens:
002:009
Let
thine
eyes
be
on
the
field
that
they
do
reap,
and
go
thou
after
them:
have
I
not
charged
the
young
men
that
they
shall
not
touch
thee?
and
when
thou
art
athirst,
go
unto
the
vessels,
and
drink
of
that
which
the
young
men
have
drawn.
002:010
Then
she
fell
on
her
face,
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground,
and
said
unto
him,
Why
have
I
found
grace
in
thine
eyes,
that
thou
shouldest
take
knowledge
of
me,
seeing
I
am
a
stranger?
002:011
And
Boaz
answered
and
said
unto
her,
It
hath
fully
been
shewed
me,
all
that
thou
hast
done
unto
thy
mother
in
law
since
the
death
of
thine
husband:
and
how
thou
hast
left
thy
father
and
thy
mother,
and
the
land
of
thy
nativity,
and
art
come
unto
a
people
which
thou
knewest
not
heretofore.
002:012
The
LORD
recompense
thy
work,
and
a
full
reward
be
given
thee
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
under
whose
wings
thou
art
come
to
trust.
002:013
Then
she
said,
Let
me
find
favour
in
thy
sight,
my
lord;
for
that
thou
hast
comforted
me,
and
for
that
thou
hast
spoken
friendly
unto
thine
handmaid,
though
I
be
not
like
unto
one
of
thine
handmaidens.
002:014
And
Boaz
said
unto
her,
At
mealtime
come
thou
hither,
and
eat
of
the
bread,
and
dip
thy
morsel
in
the
vinegar.
And
she
sat
beside
the
reapers:
and
he
reached
her
parched
corn,
and
she
did
eat,
and
was
sufficed,
and
left.
002:015
And
when
she
was
risen
up
to
glean,
Boaz
commanded
his
young
men,
saying,
Let
her
glean
even
among
the
sheaves,
and
reproach
her
not:
002:016
And
let
fall
also
some
of
the
handfuls
of
purpose
for
her,
and
leave
them,
that
she
may
glean
them,
and
rebuke
her
not.
002:017
So
she
gleaned
in
the
field
until
even,
and
beat
out
that
she
had
gleaned:
and
it
was
about
an
ephah
of
barley.
002:018
And
she
took
it
up,
and
went
into
the
city:
and
her
mother
in
law
saw
what
she
had
gleaned:
and
she
brought
forth,
and
gave
to
her
that
she
had
reserved
after
she
was
sufficed.
002:019
And
her
mother
in
law
said
unto
her,
Where
hast
thou
gleaned
to
day?
and
where
wroughtest
thou?
blessed
be
he
that
did
take
knowledge
of
thee.
And
she
shewed
her
mother
in
law
with
whom
she
had
wrought,
and
said,
The
man's
name
with
whom
I
wrought
to
day
is
Boaz.
002:020
And
Naomi
said
unto
her
daughter
in
law,
Blessed
be
he
of
the
LORD,
who
hath
not
left
off
his
kindness
to
the
living
and
to
the
dead.
And
Naomi
said
unto
her,
The
man
is
near
of
kin
unto
us,
one
of
our
next
kinsmen.
002:021
And
Ruth
the
Moabitess
said,
He
said
unto
me
also,
Thou
shalt
keep
fast
by
my
young
men,
until
they
have
ended
all
my
harvest.
002:022
And
Naomi
said
unto
Ruth
her
daughter
in
law,
It
is
good,
my
daughter,
that
thou
go
out
with
his
maidens,
that
they
meet
thee
not
in
any
other
field.
002:023
So
she
kept
fast
by
the
maidens
of
Boaz
to
glean
unto
the
end
of
barley
harvest
and
of
wheat
harvest;
and
dwelt
with
her
mother
in
law.
003:001
Then
Naomi
her
mother
in
law
said
unto
her,
My
daughter,
shall
I
not
seek
rest
for
thee,
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee?
003:002
And
now
is
not
Boaz
of
our
kindred,
with
whose
maidens
thou
wast?
Behold,
he
winnoweth
barley
to
night
in
the
threshingfloor.
003:003
Wash
thyself
therefore,
and
anoint
thee,
and
put
thy
raiment
upon
thee,
and
get
thee
down
to
the
floor:
but
make
not
thyself
known
unto
the
man,
until
he
shall
have
done
eating
and
drinking.
003:004
And
it
shall
be,
when
he
lieth
down,
that
thou
shalt
mark
the
place
where
he
shall
lie,
and
thou
shalt
go
in,
and
uncover
his
feet,
and
lay
thee
down;
and
he
will
tell
thee
what
thou
shalt
do.
003:005
And
she
said
unto
her,
All
that
thou
sayest
unto
me
I
will
do.
003:006
And
she
went
down
unto
the
floor,
and
did
according
to
all
that
her
mother
in
law
bade
her.
003:007
And
when
Boaz
had
eaten
and
drunk,
and
his
heart
was
merry,
he
went
to
lie
down
at
the
end
of
the
heap
of
corn:
and
she
came
softly,
and
uncovered
his
feet,
and
laid
her
down.
003:008
And
it
came
to
pass
at
midnight,
that
the
man
was
afraid,
and
turned
himself:
and,
behold,
a
woman
lay
at
his
feet.
003:009
And
he
said,
Who
art
thou?
And
she
answered,
I
am
Ruth
thine
handmaid:
spread
therefore
thy
skirt
over
thine
handmaid;
for
thou
art
a
near
kinsman.
003:010
And
he
said,
Blessed
be
thou
of
the
LORD,
my
daughter:
for
thou
hast
shewed
more
kindness
in
the
latter
end
than
at
the
beginning,
inasmuch
as
thou
followedst
not
young
men,
whether
poor
or
rich.
003:011
And
now,
my
daughter,
fear
not;
I
will
do
to
thee
all
that
thou
requirest:
for
all
the
city
of
my
people
doth
know
that
thou
art
a
virtuous
woman.
003:012
And
now
it
is
true
that
I
am
thy
near
kinsman:
howbeit
there
is
a
kinsman
nearer
than
I.
003:013
Tarry
this
night,
and
it
shall
be
in
the
morning,
that
if
he
will
perform
unto
thee
the
part
of
a
kinsman,
well;
let
him
do
the
kinsman's
part:
but
if
he
will
not
do
the
part
of
a
kinsman
to
thee,
then
will
I
do
the
part
of
a
kinsman
to
thee,
as
the
LORD
liveth:
lie
down
until
the
morning.
003:014
And
she
lay
at
his
feet
until
the
morning:
and
she
rose
up
before
one
could
know
another.
And
he
said,
Let
it
not
be
known
that
a
woman
came
into
the
floor.
003:015
Also
he
said,
Bring
the
vail
that
thou
hast
upon
thee,
and
hold
it.
And
when
she
held
it,
he
measured
six
measures
of
barley,
and
laid
it
on
her:
and
she
went
into
the
city.
003:016
And
when
she
came
to
her
mother
in
law,
she
said,
Who
art
thou,
my
daughter?
And
she
told
her
all
that
the
man
had
done
to
her.
003:017
And
she
said,
These
six
measures
of
barley
gave
he
me;
for
he
said
to
me,
Go
not
empty
unto
thy
mother
in
law.
003:018
Then
said
she,
Sit
still,
my
daughter,
until
thou
know
how
the
matter
will
fall:
for
the
man
will
not
be
in
rest,
until
he
have
finished
the
thing
this
day.
004:001
Then
went
Boaz
up
to
the
gate,
and
sat
him
down
there:
and,
behold,
the
kinsman
of
whom
Boaz
spake
came
by;
unto
whom
he
said,
Ho,
such
a
one!
turn
aside,
sit
down
here.
And
he
turned
aside,
and
sat
down.
004:002
And
he
took
ten
men
of
the
elders
of
the
city,
and
said,
Sit
ye
down
here.
And
they
sat
down.
004:003
And
he
said
unto
the
kinsman,
Naomi,
that
is
come
again
out
of
the
country
of
Moab,
selleth
a
parcel
of
land,
which
was
our
brother
Elimelech's:
004:004
And
I
thought
to
advertise
thee,
saying,
Buy
it
before
the
inhabitants,
and
before
the
elders
of
my
people.
If
thou
wilt
redeem
it,
redeem
it:
but
if
thou
wilt
not
redeem
it,
then
tell
me,
that
I
may
know:
for
there
is
none
to
redeem
it
beside
thee;
and
I
am
after
thee.
And
he
said,
I
will
redeem
it.
004:005
Then
said
Boaz,
What
day
thou
buyest
the
field
of
the
hand
of
Naomi,
thou
must
buy
it
also
of
Ruth
the
Moabitess,
the
wife
of
the
dead,
to
raise
up
the
name
of
the
dead
upon
his
inheritance.
004:006
And
the
kinsman
said,
I
cannot
redeem
it
for
myself,
lest
I
mar
mine
own
inheritance:
redeem
thou
my
right
to
thyself;
for
I
cannot
redeem
it.
004:007
Now
this
was
the
manner
in
former
time
in
Israel
concerning
redeeming
and
concerning
changing,
for
to
confirm
all
things;
a
man
plucked
off
his
shoe,
and
gave
it
to
his
neighbour:
and
this
was
a
testimony
in
Israel.
004:008
Therefore
the
kinsman
said
unto
Boaz,
Buy
it
for
thee.
So
he
drew
off
his
shoe.
004:009
And
Boaz
said
unto
the
elders,
and
unto
all
the
people,
Ye
are
witnesses
this
day,
that
I
have
bought
all
that
was
Elimelech's,
and
all
that
was
Chilion's
and
Mahlon's,
of
the
hand
of
Naomi.
004:010
Moreover
Ruth
the
Moabitess,
the
wife
of
Mahlon,
have
I
purchased
to
be
my
wife,
to
raise
up
the
name
of
the
dead
upon
his
inheritance,
that
the
name
of
the
dead
be
not
cut
off
from
among
his
brethren,
and
from
the
gate
of
his
place:
ye
are
witnesses
this
day.
004:011
And
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
gate,
and
the
elders,
said,
We
are
witnesses.
The
LORD
make
the
woman
that
is
come
into
thine
house
like
Rachel
and
like
Leah,
which
two
did
build
the
house
of
Israel:
and
do
thou
worthily
in
Ephratah,
and
be
famous
in
Bethlehem:
004:012
And
let
thy
house
be
like
the
house
of
Pharez,
whom
Tamar
bare
unto
Judah,
of
the
seed
which
the
LORD
shall
give
thee
of
this
young
woman.
004:013
So
Boaz
took
Ruth,
and
she
was
his
wife:
and
when
he
went
in
unto
her,
the
LORD
gave
her
conception,
and
she
bare
a
son.
004:014
And
the
women
said
unto
Naomi,
Blessed
be
the
LORD,
which
hath
not
left
thee
this
day
without
a
kinsman,
that
his
name
may
be
famous
in
Israel.
004:015
And
he
shall
be
unto
thee
a
restorer
of
thy
life,
and
a
nourisher
of
thine
old
age:
for
thy
daughter
in
law,
which
loveth
thee,
which
is
better
to
thee
than
seven
sons,
hath
born
him.
004:016
And
Naomi
took
the
child,
and
laid
it
in
her
bosom,
and
became
nurse
unto
it.
004:017
And
the
women
her
neighbours
gave
it
a
name,
saying,
There
is
a
son
born
to
Naomi;
and
they
called
his
name
Obed:
he
is
the
father
of
Jesse,
the
father
of
David.
004:018
Now
these
are
the
generations
of
Pharez:
Pharez
begat
Hezron,
004:019
And
Hezron
begat
Ram,
and
Ram
begat
Amminadab,
004:020
And
Amminadab
begat
Nahshon,
and
Nahshon
begat
Salmon,
004:021
And
Salmon
begat
Boaz,
and
Boaz
begat
Obed,
004:022
And
Obed
begat
Jesse,
and
Jesse
begat
David.
Book
09	1
Samuel
001:001
Now
there
was
a
certain
man
of
Ramathaimzophim,
of
mount
Ephraim,
and
his
name
was
Elkanah,
the
son
of
Jeroham,
the
son
of
Elihu,
the
son
of
Tohu,
the
son
of
Zuph,
an
Ephrathite:
001:002
And
he
had
two
wives;
the
name
of
the
one
was
Hannah,
and
the
name
of
the
other
Peninnah:
and
Peninnah
had
children,
but
Hannah
had
no
children.
001:003
And
this
man
went
up
out
of
his
city
yearly
to
worship
and
to
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
of
hosts
in
Shiloh.
And
the
two
sons
of
Eli,
Hophni
and
Phinehas,
the
priests
of
the
LORD,
were
there.
001:004
And
when
the
time
was
that
Elkanah
offered,
he
gave
to
Peninnah
his
wife,
and
to
all
her
sons
and
her
daughters,
portions:
001:005
But
unto
Hannah
he
gave
a
worthy
portion;
for
he
loved
Hannah:
but
the
LORD
had
shut
up
her
womb.
001:006
And
her
adversary
also
provoked
her
sore,
for
to
make
her
fret,
because
the
LORD
had
shut
up
her
womb.
001:007
And
as
he
did
so
year
by
year,
when
she
went
up
to
the
house
of
the
LORD,
so
she
provoked
her;
therefore
she
wept,
and
did
not
eat.
001:008
Then
said
Elkanah
her
husband
to
her,
Hannah,
why
weepest
thou?
and
why
eatest
thou
not?
and
why
is
thy
heart
grieved?
am
not
I
better
to
thee
than
ten
sons?
001:009
So
Hannah
rose
up
after
they
had
eaten
in
Shiloh,
and
