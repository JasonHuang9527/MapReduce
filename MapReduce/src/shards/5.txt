is
this
place!
this
is
none
other
but
the
house
of
God,
and
this
is
the
gate
of
heaven.
028:018
And
Jacob
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
took
the
stone
that
he
had
put
for
his
pillows,
and
set
it
up
for
a
pillar,
and
poured
oil
upon
the
top
of
it.
028:019
And
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
Bethel:
but
the
name
of
that
city
was
called
Luz
at
the
first.
028:020
And
Jacob
vowed
a
vow,
saying,
If
God
will
be
with
me,
and
will
keep
me
in
this
way
that
I
go,
and
will
give
me
bread
to
eat,
and
raiment
to
put
on,
028:021
So
that
I
come
again
to
my
father's
house
in
peace;
then
shall
the
LORD
be
my
God:
028:022
And
this
stone,
which
I
have
set
for
a
pillar,
shall
be
God's
house:
and
of
all
that
thou
shalt
give
me
I
will
surely
give
the
tenth
unto
thee.
029:001
Then
Jacob
went
on
his
journey,
and
came
into
the
land
of
the
people
of
the
east.
029:002
And
he
looked,
and
behold
a
well
in
the
field,
and,
lo,
there
were
three
flocks
of
sheep
lying
by
it;
for
out
of
that
well
they
watered
the
flocks:
and
a
great
stone
was
upon
the
well's
mouth.
029:003
And
thither
were
all
the
flocks
gathered:
and
they
rolled
the
stone
from
the
well's
mouth,
and
watered
the
sheep,
and
put
the
stone
again
upon
the
well's
mouth
in
his
place.
029:004
And
Jacob
said
unto
them,
My
brethren,
whence
be
ye?
And
they
said,
Of
Haran
are
we.
029:005
And
he
said
unto
them,
Know
ye
Laban
the
son
of
Nahor?
And
they
said,
We
know
him.
029:006
And
he
said
unto
them,
Is
he
well?
And
they
said,
He
is
well:
and,
behold,
Rachel
his
daughter
cometh
with
the
sheep.
029:007
And
he
said,
Lo,
it
is
yet
high
day,
neither
is
it
time
that
the
cattle
should
be
gathered
together:
water
ye
the
sheep,
and
go
and
feed
them.
029:008
And
they
said,
We
cannot,
until
all
the
flocks
be
gathered
together,
and
till
they
roll
the
stone
from
the
well's
mouth;
then
we
water
the
sheep.
029:009
And
while
he
yet
spake
with
them,
Rachel
came
with
her
father's
sheep;
for
she
kept
them.
029:010
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Jacob
saw
Rachel
the
daughter
of
Laban
his
mother's
brother,
and
the
sheep
of
Laban
his
mother's
brother,
that
Jacob
went
near,
and
rolled
the
stone
from
the
well's
mouth,
and
watered
the
flock
of
Laban
his
mother's
brother.
029:011
And
Jacob
kissed
Rachel,
and
lifted
up
his
voice,
and
wept.
029:012
And
Jacob
told
Rachel
that
he
was
her
father's
brother,
and
that
he
was
Rebekah's
son:
and
she
ran
and
told
her
father.
029:013
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Laban
heard
the
tidings
of
Jacob
his
sister's
son,
that
he
ran
to
meet
him,
and
embraced
him,
and
kissed
him,
and
brought
him
to
his
house.
And
he
told
Laban
all
these
things.
029:014
And
Laban
said
to
him,
Surely
thou
art
my
bone
and
my
flesh.
And
he
abode
with
him
the
space
of
a
month.
029:015
And
Laban
said
unto
Jacob,
Because
thou
art
my
brother,
shouldest
thou
therefore
serve
me
for
nought?
tell
me,
what
shall
thy
wages
be?
029:016
And
Laban
had
two
daughters:
the
name
of
the
elder
was
Leah,
and
the
name
of
the
younger
was
Rachel.
029:017
Leah
was
tender
eyed;
but
Rachel
was
beautiful
and
well
favoured.
029:018
And
Jacob
loved
Rachel;
and
said,
I
will
serve
thee
seven
years
for
Rachel
thy
younger
daughter.
029:019
And
Laban
said,
It
is
better
that
I
give
her
to
thee,
than
that
I
should
give
her
to
another
man:
abide
with
me.
029:020
And
Jacob
served
seven
years
for
Rachel;
and
they
seemed
unto
him
but
a
few
days,
for
the
love
he
had
to
her.
029:021
And
Jacob
said
unto
Laban,
Give
me
my
wife,
for
my
days
are
fulfilled,
that
I
may
go
in
unto
her.
029:022
And
Laban
gathered
together
all
the
men
of
the
place,
and
made
a
feast.
029:023
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
evening,
that
he
took
Leah
his
daughter,
and
brought
her
to
him;
and
he
went
in
unto
her.
029:024
And
Laban
gave
unto
his
daughter
Leah
Zilpah
his
maid
for
an
handmaid.
029:025
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
in
the
morning,
behold,
it
was
Leah:
and
he
said
to
Laban,
What
is
this
thou
hast
done
unto
me?
did
not
I
serve
with
thee
for
Rachel?
wherefore
then
hast
thou
beguiled
me?
029:026
And
Laban
said,
It
must
not
be
so
done
in
our
country,
to
give
the
younger
before
the
firstborn.
029:027
Fulfil
her
week,
and
we
will
give
thee
this
also
for
the
service
which
thou
shalt
serve
with
me
yet
seven
other
years.
029:028
And
Jacob
did
so,
and
fulfilled
her
week:
and
he
gave
him
Rachel
his
daughter
to
wife
also.
029:029
And
Laban
gave
to
Rachel
his
daughter
Bilhah
his
handmaid
to
be
her
maid.
029:030
And
he
went
in
also
unto
Rachel,
and
he
loved
also
Rachel
more
than
Leah,
and
served
with
him
yet
seven
other
years.
029:031
And
when
the
LORD
saw
that
Leah
was
hated,
he
opened
her
womb:
but
Rachel
was
barren.
029:032
And
Leah
conceived,
and
bare
a
son,
and
she
called
his
name
Reuben:
for
she
said,
Surely
the
LORD
hath
looked
upon
my
affliction;
now
therefore
my
husband
will
love
me.
029:033
And
she
conceived
again,
and
bare
a
son;
and
said,
Because
the
LORD
hath
heard
I
was
hated,
he
hath
therefore
given
me
this
son
also:
and
she
called
his
name
Simeon.
029:034
And
she
conceived
again,
and
bare
a
son;
and
said,
Now
this
time
will
my
husband
be
joined
unto
me,
because
I
have
born
him
three
sons:
therefore
was
his
name
called
Levi.
029:035
And
she
conceived
again,
and
bare
a
son:
and
she
said,
Now
will
I
praise
the
LORD:
therefore
she
called
his
name
Judah;
and
left
bearing.
030:001
And
when
Rachel
saw
that
she
bare
Jacob
no
children,
Rachel
envied
her
sister;
and
said
unto
Jacob,
Give
me
children,
or
else
I
die.
030:002
And
Jacob's
anger
was
kindled
against
Rachel:
and
he
said,
Am
I
in
God's
stead,
who
hath
withheld
from
thee
the
fruit
of
the
womb?
030:003
And
she
said,
Behold
my
maid
Bilhah,
go
in
unto
her;
and
she
shall
bear
upon
my
knees,
that
I
may
also
have
children
by
her.
030:004
And
she
gave
him
Bilhah
her
handmaid
to
wife:
and
Jacob
went
in
unto
her.
030:005
And
Bilhah
conceived,
and
bare
Jacob
a
son.
030:006
And
Rachel
said,
God
hath
judged
me,
and
hath
also
heard
my
voice,
and
hath
given
me
a
son:
therefore
called
she
his
name
Dan.
030:007
And
Bilhah
Rachel's
maid
conceived
again,
and
bare
Jacob
a
second
son.
030:008
And
Rachel
said,
With
great
wrestlings
have
I
wrestled
with
my
sister,
and
I
have
prevailed:
and
she
called
his
name
Naphtali.
030:009
When
Leah
saw
that
she
had
left
bearing,
she
took
Zilpah
her
maid,
and
gave
her
Jacob
to
wife.
030:010
And
Zilpah
Leah's
maid
bare
Jacob
a
son.
030:011
And
Leah
said,
A
troop
cometh:
and
she
called
his
name
Gad.
030:012
And
Zilpah
Leah's
maid
bare
Jacob
a
second
son.
030:013
And
Leah
said,
Happy
am
I,
for
the
daughters
will
call
me
blessed:
and
she
called
his
name
Asher.
030:014
And
Reuben
went
in
the
days
of
wheat
harvest,
and
found
mandrakes
in
the
field,
and
brought
them
unto
his
mother
Leah.
Then
Rachel
said
to
Leah,
Give
me,
I
pray
thee,
of
thy
son's
mandrakes.
030:015
And
she
said
unto
her,
Is
it
a
small
matter
that
thou
hast
taken
my
husband?
and
wouldest
thou
take
away
my
son's
mandrakes
also?
And
Rachel
said,
Therefore
he
shall
lie
with
thee
to
night
for
thy
son's
mandrakes.
030:016
And
Jacob
came
out
of
the
field
in
the
evening,
and
Leah
went
out
to
meet
him,
and
said,
Thou
must
come
in
unto
me;
for
surely
I
have
hired
thee
with
my
son's
mandrakes.
And
he
lay
with
her
that
night.
030:017
And
God
hearkened
unto
Leah,
and
she
conceived,
and
bare
Jacob
the
fifth
son.
030:018
And
Leah
said,
God
hath
given
me
my
hire,
because
I
have
given
my
maiden
to
my
husband:
and
she
called
his
name
Issachar.
030:019
And
Leah
conceived
again,
and
bare
Jacob
the
sixth
son.
030:020
And
Leah
said,
God
hath
endued
me
with
a
good
dowry;
now
will
my
husband
dwell
with
me,
because
I
have
born
him
six
sons:
and
she
called
his
name
Zebulun.
030:021
And
afterwards
she
bare
a
daughter,
and
called
her
name
Dinah.
030:022
And
God
remembered
Rachel,
and
God
hearkened
to
her,
and
opened
her
womb.
030:023
And
she
conceived,
and
bare
a
son;
and
said,
God
hath
taken
away
my
reproach:
030:024
And
she
called
his
name
Joseph;
and
said,
The
LORD
shall
add
to
me
another
son.
030:025
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Rachel
had
born
Joseph,
that
Jacob
said
unto
Laban,
Send
me
away,
that
I
may
go
unto
mine
own
place,
and
to
my
country.
030:026
Give
me
my
wives
and
my
children,
for
whom
I
have
served
thee,
and
let
me
go:
for
thou
knowest
my
service
which
I
have
done
thee.
030:027
And
Laban
said
unto
him,
I
pray
thee,
if
I
have
found
favour
in
thine
eyes,
tarry:
for
I
have
learned
by
experience
that
the
LORD
hath
blessed
me
for
thy
sake.
030:028
And
he
said,
Appoint
me
thy
wages,
and
I
will
give
it.
030:029
And
he
said
unto
him,
Thou
knowest
how
I
have
served
thee,
and
how
thy
cattle
was
with
me.
030:030
For
it
was
little
which
thou
hadst
before
I
came,
and
it
is
now
increased
unto
a
multitude;
and
the
LORD
hath
blessed
thee
since
my
coming:
and
now
when
shall
I
provide
for
mine
own
house
also?
030:031
And
he
said,
What
shall
I
give
thee?
And
Jacob
said,
Thou
shalt
not
give
me
any
thing:
if
thou
wilt
do
this
thing
for
me,
I
will
again
feed
and
keep
thy
flock.
030:032
I
will
pass
through
all
thy
flock
to
day,
removing
from
thence
all
the
speckled
and
spotted
cattle,
and
all
the
brown
cattle
among
the
sheep,
and
the
spotted
and
speckled
among
the
goats:
and
of
such
shall
be
my
hire.
030:033
So
shall
my
righteousness
answer
for
me
in
time
to
come,
when
it
shall
come
for
my
hire
before
thy
face:
every
one
that
is
not
speckled
and
spotted
among
the
goats,
and
brown
among
the
sheep,
that
shall
be
counted
stolen
with
me.
030:034
And
Laban
said,
Behold,
I
would
it
might
be
according
to
thy
word.
030:035
And
he
removed
that
day
the
he
goats
that
were
ringstraked
and
spotted,
and
all
the
she
goats
that
were
speckled
and
spotted,
and
every
one
that
had
some
white
in
it,
and
all
the
brown
among
the
sheep,
and
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
his
sons.
030:036
And
he
set
three
days'
journey
betwixt
himself
and
Jacob:
and
Jacob
fed
the
rest
of
Laban's
flocks.
030:037
And
Jacob
took
him
rods
of
green
poplar,
and
of
the
hazel
and
chesnut
tree;
and
pilled
white
strakes
in
them,
and
made
the
white
appear
which
was
in
the
rods.
030:038
And
he
set
the
rods
which
he
had
pilled
before
the
flocks
in
the
gutters
in
the
watering
troughs
when
the
flocks
came
to
drink,
that
they
should
conceive
when
they
came
to
drink.
030:039
And
the
flocks
conceived
before
the
rods,
and
brought
forth
cattle
ringstraked,
speckled,
and
spotted.
030:040
And
Jacob
did
separate
the
lambs,
and
set
the
faces
of
the
flocks
toward
the
ringstraked,
and
all
the
brown
in
the
flock
of
Laban;
and
he
put
his
own
flocks
by
themselves,
and
put
them
not
unto
Laban's
cattle.
030:041
And
it
came
to
pass,
whensoever
the
stronger
cattle
did
conceive,
that
Jacob
laid
the
rods
before
the
eyes
of
the
cattle
in
the
gutters,
that
they
might
conceive
among
the
rods.
030:042
But
when
the
cattle
were
feeble,
he
put
them
not
in:
so
the
feebler
were
Laban's,
and
the
stronger
Jacob's.
030:043
And
the
man
increased
exceedingly,
and
had
much
cattle,
and
maidservants,
and
menservants,
and
camels,
and
asses.
031:001
And
he
heard
the
words
of
Laban's
sons,
saying,
Jacob
hath
taken
away
all
that
was
our
father's;
and
of
that
which
was
our
father's
hath
he
gotten
all
this
glory.
031:002
And
Jacob
beheld
the
countenance
of
Laban,
and,
behold,
it
was
not
toward
him
as
before.
031:003
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Jacob,
Return
unto
the
land
of
thy
fathers,
and
to
thy
kindred;
and
I
will
be
with
thee.
031:004
And
Jacob
sent
and
called
Rachel
and
Leah
to
the
field
unto
his
flock,
031:005
And
said
unto
them,
I
see
your
father's
countenance,
that
it
is
not
toward
me
as
before;
but
the
God
of
my
father
hath
been
with
me.
031:006
And
ye
know
that
with
all
my
power
I
have
served
your
father.
031:007
And
your
father
hath
deceived
me,
and
changed
my
wages
ten
times;
but
God
suffered
him
not
to
hurt
me.
031:008
If
he
said
thus,
The
speckled
shall
be
thy
wages;
then
all
the
cattle
bare
speckled:
and
if
he
said
thus,
The
ringstraked
shall
be
thy
hire;
then
bare
all
the
cattle
ringstraked.
031:009
Thus
God
hath
taken
away
the
cattle
of
your
father,
and
given
them
to
me.
031:010
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
that
the
cattle
conceived,
that
I
lifted
up
mine
eyes,
and
saw
in
a
dream,
and,
behold,
the
rams
which
leaped
upon
the
cattle
were
ringstraked,
speckled,
and
grisled.
031:011
And
the
angel
of
God
spake
unto
me
in
a
dream,
saying,
Jacob:
And
I
said,
Here
am
I.
031:012
And
he
said,
Lift
up
now
thine
eyes,
and
see,
all
the
rams
which
leap
upon
the
cattle
are
ringstraked,
speckled,
and
grisled:
for
I
have
seen
all
that
Laban
doeth
unto
thee.
031:013
I
am
the
God
of
Bethel,
where
thou
anointedst
the
pillar,
and
where
thou
vowedst
a
vow
unto
me:
now
arise,
get
thee
out
from
this
land,
and
return
unto
the
land
of
thy
kindred.
031:014
And
Rachel
and
Leah
answered
and
said
unto
him,
Is
there
yet
any
portion
or
inheritance
for
us
in
our
father's
house?
031:015
Are
we
not
counted
of
him
strangers?
for
he
hath
sold
us,
and
hath
quite
devoured
also
our
money.
031:016
For
all
the
riches
which
God
hath
taken
from
our
father,
that
is
ours,
and
our
children's:
now
then,
whatsoever
God
hath
said
unto
thee,
do.
031:017
Then
Jacob
rose
up,
and
set
his
sons
and
his
wives
upon
camels;
031:018
And
he
carried
away
all
his
cattle,
and
all
his
goods
which
he
had
gotten,
the
cattle
of
his
getting,
which
he
had
gotten
in
Padanaram,
for
to
go
to
Isaac
his
father
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
031:019
And
Laban
went
to
shear
his
sheep:
and
Rachel
had
stolen
the
images
that
were
her
father's.
031:020
And
Jacob
stole
away
unawares
to
Laban
the
Syrian,
in
that
he
told
him
not
that
he
fled.
031:021
So
he
fled
with
all
that
he
had;
and
he
rose
up,
and
passed
over
the
river,
and
set
his
face
toward
the
mount
Gilead.
031:022
And
it
was
told
Laban
on
the
third
day
that
Jacob
was
fled.
031:023
And
he
took
his
brethren
with
him,
and
pursued
after
him
seven
days'
journey;
and
they
overtook
him
in
the
mount
Gilead.
031:024
And
God
came
to
Laban
the
Syrian
in
a
dream
by
night,
and
said
unto
him,
Take
heed
that
thou
speak
not
to
Jacob
either
good
or
bad.
031:025
Then
Laban
overtook
Jacob.
Now
Jacob
had
pitched
his
tent
in
the
mount:
and
Laban
with
his
brethren
pitched
in
the
mount
of
Gilead.
031:026
And
Laban
said
to
Jacob,
What
hast
thou
done,
that
thou
hast
stolen
away
unawares
to
me,
and
carried
away
my
daughters,
as
captives
taken
with
the
sword?
031:027
Wherefore
didst
thou
flee
away
secretly,
and
steal
away
from
me;
and
didst
not
tell
me,
that
I
might
have
sent
thee
away
with
mirth,
and
with
songs,
with
tabret,
and
with
harp?
031:028
And
hast
not
suffered
me
to
kiss
my
sons
and
my
daughters?
thou
hast
now
done
foolishly
in
so
doing.
031:029
It
is
in
the
power
of
my
hand
to
do
you
hurt:
but
the
God
of
your
father
spake
unto
me
yesternight,
saying,
Take
thou
heed
that
thou
speak
not
to
Jacob
either
good
or
bad.
031:030
And
now,
though
thou
wouldest
needs
be
gone,
because
thou
sore
longedst
after
thy
father's
house,
yet
wherefore
hast
thou
stolen
my
gods?
031:031
And
Jacob
answered
and
said
to
Laban,
Because
I
was
afraid:
for
I
said,
Peradventure
thou
wouldest
take
by
force
thy
daughters
from
me.
031:032
With
whomsoever
thou
findest
thy
gods,
let
him
not
live:
before
our
brethren
discern
thou
what
is
thine
with
me,
and
take
it
to
thee.
For
Jacob
knew
not
that
Rachel
had
stolen
them.
031:033
And
Laban
went
into
Jacob's
tent,
and
into
Leah's
tent,
and
into
the
two
maidservants'
tents;
but
he
found
them
not.
Then
went
he
out
of
Leah's
tent,
and
entered
into
Rachel's
tent.
031:034
Now
Rachel
had
taken
the
images,
and
put
them
in
the
camel's
furniture,
and
sat
upon
them.
And
Laban
searched
all
the
tent,
but
found
them
not.
031:035
And
she
said
to
her
father,
Let
it
not
displease
my
lord
that
I
cannot
rise
up
before
thee;
for
the
custom
of
women
is
upon
me.
And
he
searched
but
found
not
the
images.
031:036
And
Jacob
was
wroth,
and
chode
with
Laban:
and
Jacob
answered
and
said
to
Laban,
What
is
my
trespass?
what
is
my
sin,
that
thou
hast
so
hotly
pursued
after
me?
031:037
Whereas
thou
hast
searched
all
my
stuff,
what
hast
thou
found
of
all
thy
household
stuff?
set
it
here
before
my
brethren
and
thy
brethren,
that
they
may
judge
betwixt
us
both.
031:038
This
twenty
years
have
I
been
with
thee;
thy
ewes
and
thy
she
goats
have
not
cast
their
young,
and
the
rams
of
thy
flock
have
I
not
eaten.
031:039
That
which
was
torn
of
beasts
I
brought
not
unto
thee;
I
bare
the
loss
of
it;
of
my
hand
didst
thou
require
it,
whether
stolen
by
day,
or
stolen
by
night.
031:040
Thus
I
was;
in
the
day
the
drought
consumed
me,
and
the
frost
by
night;
and
my
sleep
departed
from
mine
eyes.
031:041
Thus
have
I
been
twenty
years
in
thy
house;
I
served
thee
fourteen
years
for
thy
two
daughters,
and
six
years
for
thy
cattle:
and
thou
hast
changed
my
wages
ten
times.
031:042
Except
the
God
of
my
father,
the
God
of
Abraham,
and
the
fear
of
Isaac,
had
been
with
me,
surely
thou
hadst
sent
me
away
now
empty.
God
hath
seen
mine
affliction
and
the
labour
of
my
hands,
and
rebuked
thee
yesternight.
031:043
And
Laban
answered
and
said
unto
Jacob,
These
daughters
are
my
daughters,
and
these
children
are
my
children,
and
these
cattle
are
my
cattle,
and
all
that
thou
seest
is
mine:
and
what
can
I
do
this
day
unto
these
my
daughters,
or
unto
their
children
which
they
have
born?
031:044
Now
therefore
come
thou,
let
us
make
a
covenant,
I
and
thou;
and
let
it
be
for
a
witness
between
me
and
thee.
031:045
And
Jacob
took
a
stone,
and
set
it
up
for
a
pillar.
031:046
And
Jacob
said
unto
his
brethren,
Gather
stones;
and
they
took
stones,
and
made
an
heap:
and
they
did
eat
there
upon
the
heap.
031:047
And
Laban
called
it
Jegarsahadutha:
but
Jacob
called
it
Galeed.
031:048
And
Laban
said,
This
heap
is
a
witness
between
me
and
thee
this
day.
Therefore
was
the
name
of
it
called
Galeed;
031:049
And
Mizpah;
for
he
said,
The
LORD
watch
between
me
and
thee,
when
we
are
absent
one
from
another.
031:050
If
thou
shalt
afflict
my
daughters,
or
if
thou
shalt
take
other
wives
beside
my
daughters,
no
man
is
with
us;
see,
God
is
witness
betwixt
me
and
thee.
031:051
And
Laban
said
to
Jacob,
Behold
this
heap,
and
behold
this
pillar,
which
I
have
cast
betwixt
me
and
thee:
031:052
This
heap
be
witness,
and
this
pillar
be
witness,
that
I
will
not
pass
over
this
heap
to
thee,
and
that
thou
shalt
not
pass
over
this
heap
and
this
pillar
unto
me,
for
harm.
031:053
The
God
of
Abraham,
and
the
God
of
Nahor,
the
God
of
their
father,
judge
betwixt
us.
And
Jacob
sware
by
the
fear
of
his
father
Isaac.
031:054
Then
Jacob
offered
sacrifice
upon
the
mount,
and
called
his
brethren
to
eat
bread:
and
they
did
eat
bread,
and
tarried
all
night
in
the
mount.
031:055
And
early
in
the
morning
Laban
rose
up,
and
kissed
his
sons
and
his
daughters,
and
blessed
them:
and
Laban
departed,
and
returned
unto
his
place.
032:001
And
Jacob
went
on
his
way,
and
the
angels
of
God
met
him.
032:002
And
when
Jacob
saw
them,
he
said,
This
is
God's
host:
and
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
Mahanaim.
032:003
And
Jacob
sent
messengers
before
him
to
Esau
his
brother
unto
the
land
of
Seir,
the
country
of
Edom.
032:004
And
he
commanded
them,
saying,
Thus
shall
ye
speak
unto
my
lord
Esau;
Thy
servant
Jacob
saith
thus,
I
have
sojourned
with
Laban,
and
stayed
there
until
now:
032:005
And
I
have
oxen,
and
asses,
flocks,
and
menservants,
and
womenservants:
and
I
have
sent
to
tell
my
lord,
that
I
may
find
grace
in
thy
sight.
032:006
And
the
messengers
returned
to
Jacob,
saying,
We
came
to
thy
brother
Esau,
and
also
he
cometh
to
meet
thee,
and
four
hundred
men
with
him.
032:007
Then
Jacob
was
greatly
afraid
and
distressed:
and
he
divided
the
people
that
was
with
him,
and
the
flocks,
and
herds,
and
the
camels,
into
two
bands;
032:008
And
said,
If
Esau
come
to
the
one
company,
and
smite
it,
then
the
other
company
which
is
left
shall
escape.
032:009
And
Jacob
said,
O
God
of
my
father
Abraham,
and
God
of
my
father
Isaac,
the
LORD
which
saidst
unto
me,
Return
unto
thy
country,
and
to
thy
kindred,
and
I
will
deal
well
with
thee:
032:010
I
am
not
worthy
of
the
least
of
all
the
mercies,
and
of
all
the
truth,
which
thou
hast
shewed
unto
thy
servant;
for
with
my
staff
I
passed
over
this
Jordan;
and
now
I
am
become
two
bands.
032:011
Deliver
me,
I
pray
thee,
from
the
hand
of
my
brother,
from
the
hand
of
Esau:
for
I
fear
him,
lest
he
will
come
and
smite
me,
and
the
mother
with
the
children.
032:012
And
thou
saidst,
I
will
surely
do
thee
good,
and
make
thy
seed
as
the
sand
of
the
sea,
which
cannot
be
numbered
for
multitude.
032:013
And
he
lodged
there
that
same
night;
and
took
of
that
which
came
to
his
hand
a
present
for
Esau
his
brother;
032:014
Two
hundred
she
goats,
and
twenty
he
goats,
two
hundred
ewes,
and
twenty
rams,
032:015
Thirty
milch
camels
with
their
colts,
forty
kine,
and
ten
bulls,
twenty
she
asses,
and
ten
foals.
032:016
And
he
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
his
servants,
every
drove
by
themselves;
and
said
unto
his
servants,
Pass
over
before
me,
and
put
a
space
betwixt
drove
and
drove.
032:017
And
he
commanded
the
foremost,
saying,
When
Esau
my
brother
meeteth
thee,
and
asketh
thee,
saying,
Whose
art
thou?
and
whither
goest
thou?
and
whose
are
these
before
thee?
032:018
Then
thou
shalt
say,
They
be
thy
servant
Jacob's;
it
is
a
present
sent
unto
my
lord
Esau:
and,
behold,
also
he
is
behind
us.
032:019
And
so
commanded
he
the
second,
and
the
third,
and
all
that
followed
the
droves,
saying,
On
this
manner
shall
ye
speak
unto
Esau,
when
ye
find
him.
032:020
And
say
ye
moreover,
Behold,
thy
servant
Jacob
is
behind
us.
For
he
said,
I
will
appease
him
with
the
present
that
goeth
before
me,
and
afterward
I
will
see
his
face;
peradventure
he
