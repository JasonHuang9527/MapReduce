after
they
had
drunk.
Now
Eli
the
priest
sat
upon
a
seat
by
a
post
of
the
temple
of
the
LORD.
001:010
And
she
was
in
bitterness
of
soul,
and
prayed
unto
the
LORD,
and
wept
sore.
001:011
And
she
vowed
a
vow,
and
said,
O
LORD
of
hosts,
if
thou
wilt
indeed
look
on
the
affliction
of
thine
handmaid,
and
remember
me,
and
not
forget
thine
handmaid,
but
wilt
give
unto
thine
handmaid
a
man
child,
then
I
will
give
him
unto
the
LORD
all
the
days
of
his
life,
and
there
shall
no
razor
come
upon
his
head.
001:012
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
she
continued
praying
before
the
LORD,
that
Eli
marked
her
mouth.
001:013
Now
Hannah,
she
spake
in
her
heart;
only
her
lips
moved,
but
her
voice
was
not
heard:
therefore
Eli
thought
she
had
been
drunken.
001:014
And
Eli
said
unto
her,
How
long
wilt
thou
be
drunken?
put
away
thy
wine
from
thee.
001:015
And
Hannah
answered
and
said,
No,
my
lord,
I
am
a
woman
of
a
sorrowful
spirit:
I
have
drunk
neither
wine
nor
strong
drink,
but
have
poured
out
my
soul
before
the
LORD.
001:016
Count
not
thine
handmaid
for
a
daughter
of
Belial:
for
out
of
the
abundance
of
my
complaint
and
grief
have
I
spoken
hitherto.
001:017
Then
Eli
answered
and
said,
Go
in
peace:
and
the
God
of
Israel
grant
thee
thy
petition
that
thou
hast
asked
of
him.
001:018
And
she
said,
Let
thine
handmaid
find
grace
in
thy
sight.
So
the
woman
went
her
way,
and
did
eat,
and
her
countenance
was
no
more
sad.
001:019
And
they
rose
up
in
the
morning
early,
and
worshipped
before
the
LORD,
and
returned,
and
came
to
their
house
to
Ramah:
and
Elkanah
knew
Hannah
his
wife;
and
the
LORD
remembered
her.
001:020
Wherefore
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
time
was
come
about
after
Hannah
had
conceived,
that
she
bare
a
son,
and
called
his
name
Samuel,
saying,
Because
I
have
asked
him
of
the
LORD.
001:021
And
the
man
Elkanah,
and
all
his
house,
went
up
to
offer
unto
the
LORD
the
yearly
sacrifice,
and
his
vow.
001:022
But
Hannah
went
not
up;
for
she
said
unto
her
husband,
I
will
not
go
up
until
the
child
be
weaned,
and
then
I
will
bring
him,
that
he
may
appear
before
the
LORD,
and
there
abide
for
ever.
001:023
And
Elkanah
her
husband
said
unto
her,
Do
what
seemeth
thee
good;
tarry
until
thou
have
weaned
him;
only
the
LORD
establish
his
word.
So
the
woman
abode,
and
gave
her
son
suck
until
she
weaned
him.
001:024
And
when
she
had
weaned
him,
she
took
him
up
with
her,
with
three
bullocks,
and
one
ephah
of
flour,
and
a
bottle
of
wine,
and
brought
him
unto
the
house
of
the
LORD
in
Shiloh:
and
the
child
was
young.
001:025
And
they
slew
a
bullock,
and
brought
the
child
to
Eli.
001:026
And
she
said,
Oh
my
lord,
as
thy
soul
liveth,
my
lord,
I
am
the
woman
that
stood
by
thee
here,
praying
unto
the
LORD.
001:027
For
this
child
I
prayed;
and
the
LORD
hath
given
me
my
petition
which
I
asked
of
him:
001:028
Therefore
also
I
have
lent
him
to
the
LORD;
as
long
as
he
liveth
he
shall
be
lent
to
the
LORD.
And
he
worshipped
the
LORD
there.
002:001
And
Hannah
prayed,
and
said,
My
heart
rejoiceth
in
the
LORD,
mine
horn
is
exalted
in
the
LORD:
my
mouth
is
enlarged
over
mine
enemies;
because
I
rejoice
in
thy
salvation.
002:002
There
is
none
holy
as
the
LORD:
for
there
is
none
beside
thee:
neither
is
there
any
rock
like
our
God.
002:003
Talk
no
more
so
exceeding
proudly;
let
not
arrogancy
come
out
of
your
mouth:
for
the
LORD
is
a
God
of
knowledge,
and
by
him
actions
are
weighed.
002:004
The
bows
of
the
mighty
men
are
broken,
and
they
that
stumbled
are
girded
with
strength.
002:005
They
that
were
full
have
hired
out
themselves
for
bread;
and
they
that
were
hungry
ceased:
so
that
the
barren
hath
born
seven;
and
she
that
hath
many
children
is
waxed
feeble.
002:006
The
LORD
killeth,
and
maketh
alive:
he
bringeth
down
to
the
grave,
and
bringeth
up.
002:007
The
LORD
maketh
poor,
and
maketh
rich:
he
bringeth
low,
and
lifteth
up.
002:008
He
raiseth
up
the
poor
out
of
the
dust,
and
lifteth
up
the
beggar
from
the
dunghill,
to
set
them
among
princes,
and
to
make
them
inherit
the
throne
of
glory:
for
the
pillars
of
the
earth
are
the
LORD's,
and
he
hath
set
the
world
upon
them.
002:009
He
will
keep
the
feet
of
his
saints,
and
the
wicked
shall
be
silent
in
darkness;
for
by
strength
shall
no
man
prevail.
002:010
The
adversaries
of
the
LORD
shall
be
broken
to
pieces;
out
of
heaven
shall
he
thunder
upon
them:
the
LORD
shall
judge
the
ends
of
the
earth;
and
he
shall
give
strength
unto
his
king,
and
exalt
the
horn
of
his
anointed.
002:011
And
Elkanah
went
to
Ramah
to
his
house.
And
the
child
did
minister
unto
the
LORD
before
Eli
the
priest.
002:012
Now
the
sons
of
Eli
were
sons
of
Belial;
they
knew
not
the
LORD.
002:013
And
the
priest's
custom
with
the
people
was,
that,
when
any
man
offered
sacrifice,
the
priest's
servant
came,
while
the
flesh
was
in
seething,
with
a
fleshhook
of
three
teeth
in
his
hand;
002:014
And
he
struck
it
into
the
pan,
or
kettle,
or
caldron,
or
pot;
all
that
the
fleshhook
brought
up
the
priest
took
for
himself.
So
they
did
in
Shiloh
unto
all
the
Israelites
that
came
thither.
002:015
Also
before
they
burnt
the
fat,
the
priest's
servant
came,
and
said
to
the
man
that
sacrificed,
Give
flesh
to
roast
for
the
priest;
for
he
will
not
have
sodden
flesh
of
thee,
but
raw.
002:016
And
if
any
man
said
unto
him,
Let
them
not
fail
to
burn
the
fat
presently,
and
then
take
as
much
as
thy
soul
desireth;
then
he
would
answer
him,
Nay;
but
thou
shalt
give
it
me
now:
and
if
not,
I
will
take
it
by
force.
002:017
Wherefore
the
sin
of
the
young
men
was
very
great
before
the
LORD:
for
men
abhorred
the
offering
of
the
LORD.
002:018
But
Samuel
ministered
before
the
LORD,
being
a
child,
girded
with
a
linen
ephod.
002:019
Moreover
his
mother
made
him
a
little
coat,
and
brought
it
to
him
from
year
to
year,
when
she
came
up
with
her
husband
to
offer
the
yearly
sacrifice.
002:020
And
Eli
blessed
Elkanah
and
his
wife,
and
said,
The
LORD
give
thee
seed
of
this
woman
for
the
loan
which
is
lent
to
the
LORD.
And
they
went
unto
their
own
home.
002:021
And
the
LORD
visited
Hannah,
so
that
she
conceived,
and
bare
three
sons
and
two
daughters.
And
the
child
Samuel
grew
before
the
LORD.
002:022
Now
Eli
was
very
old,
and
heard
all
that
his
sons
did
unto
all
Israel;
and
how
they
lay
with
the
women
that
assembled
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
002:023
And
he
said
unto
them,
Why
do
ye
such
things?
for
I
hear
of
your
evil
dealings
by
all
this
people.
002:024
Nay,
my
sons;
for
it
is
no
good
report
that
I
hear:
ye
make
the
LORD's
people
to
transgress.
002:025
If
one
man
sin
against
another,
the
judge
shall
judge
him:
but
if
a
man
sin
against
the
LORD,
who
shall
intreat
for
him?
Notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
their
father,
because
the
LORD
would
slay
them.
002:026
And
the
child
Samuel
grew
on,
and
was
in
favour
both
with
the
LORD,
and
also
with
men.
002:027
And
there
came
a
man
of
God
unto
Eli,
and
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Did
I
plainly
appear
unto
the
house
of
thy
father,
when
they
were
in
Egypt
in
Pharaoh's
house?
002:028
And
did
I
choose
him
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
be
my
priest,
to
offer
upon
mine
altar,
to
burn
incense,
to
wear
an
ephod
before
me?
and
did
I
give
unto
the
house
of
thy
father
all
the
offerings
made
by
fire
of
the
children
of
Israel?
002:029
Wherefore
kick
ye
at
my
sacrifice
and
at
mine
offering,
which
I
have
commanded
in
my
habitation;
and
honourest
thy
sons
above
me,
to
make
yourselves
fat
with
the
chiefest
of
all
the
offerings
of
Israel
my
people?
002:030
Wherefore
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
saith,
I
said
indeed
that
thy
house,
and
the
house
of
thy
father,
should
walk
before
me
for
ever:
but
now
the
LORD
saith,
Be
it
far
from
me;
for
them
that
honour
me
I
will
honour,
and
they
that
despise
me
shall
be
lightly
esteemed.
002:031
Behold,
the
days
come,
that
I
will
cut
off
thine
arm,
and
the
arm
of
thy
father's
house,
that
there
shall
not
be
an
old
man
in
thine
house.
002:032
And
thou
shalt
see
an
enemy
in
my
habitation,
in
all
the
wealth
which
God
shall
give
Israel:
and
there
shall
not
be
an
old
man
in
thine
house
for
ever.
002:033
And
the
man
of
thine,
whom
I
shall
not
cut
off
from
mine
altar,
shall
be
to
consume
thine
eyes,
and
to
grieve
thine
heart:
and
all
the
increase
of
thine
house
shall
die
in
the
flower
of
their
age.
002:034
And
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee,
that
shall
come
upon
thy
two
sons,
on
Hophni
and
Phinehas;
in
one
day
they
shall
die
both
of
them.
002:035
And
I
will
raise
me
up
a
faithful
priest,
that
shall
do
according
to
that
which
is
in
mine
heart
and
in
my
mind:
and
I
will
build
him
a
sure
house;
and
he
shall
walk
before
mine
anointed
for
ever.
002:036
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
that
every
one
that
is
left
in
thine
house
shall
come
and
crouch
to
him
for
a
piece
of
silver
and
a
morsel
of
bread,
and
shall
say,
Put
me,
I
pray
thee,
into
one
of
the
priests'
offices,
that
I
may
eat
a
piece
of
bread.
003:001
And
the
child
Samuel
ministered
unto
the
LORD
before
Eli.
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
was
precious
in
those
days;
there
was
no
open
vision.
003:002
And
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time,
when
Eli
was
laid
down
in
his
place,
and
his
eyes
began
to
wax
dim,
that
he
could
not
see;
003:003
And
ere
the
lamp
of
God
went
out
in
the
temple
of
the
LORD,
where
the
ark
of
God
was,
and
Samuel
was
laid
down
to
sleep;
003:004
That
the
LORD
called
Samuel:
and
he
answered,
Here
am
I.
003:005
And
he
ran
unto
Eli,
and
said,
Here
am
I;
for
thou
calledst
me.
And
he
said,
I
called
not;
lie
down
again.
And
he
went
and
lay
down.
003:006
And
the
LORD
called
yet
again,
Samuel.
And
Samuel
arose
and
went
to
Eli,
and
said,
Here
am
I;
for
thou
didst
call
me.
And
he
answered,
I
called
not,
my
son;
lie
down
again.
003:007
Now
Samuel
did
not
yet
know
the
LORD,
neither
was
the
word
of
the
LORD
yet
revealed
unto
him.
003:008
And
the
LORD
called
Samuel
again
the
third
time.
And
he
arose
and
went
to
Eli,
and
said,
Here
am
I;
for
thou
didst
call
me.
And
Eli
perceived
that
the
LORD
had
called
the
child.
003:009
Therefore
Eli
said
unto
Samuel,
Go,
lie
down:
and
it
shall
be,
if
he
call
thee,
that
thou
shalt
say,
Speak,
LORD;
for
thy
servant
heareth.
So
Samuel
went
and
lay
down
in
his
place.
003:010
And
the
LORD
came,
and
stood,
and
called
as
at
other
times,
Samuel,
Samuel.
Then
Samuel
answered,
Speak;
for
thy
servant
heareth.
003:011
And
the
LORD
said
to
Samuel,
Behold,
I
will
do
a
thing
in
Israel,
at
which
both
the
ears
of
every
one
that
heareth
it
shall
tingle.
003:012
In
that
day
I
will
perform
against
Eli
all
things
which
I
have
spoken
concerning
his
house:
when
I
begin,
I
will
also
make
an
end.
003:013
For
I
have
told
him
that
I
will
judge
his
house
for
ever
for
the
iniquity
which
he
knoweth;
because
his
sons
made
themselves
vile,
and
he
restrained
them
not.
003:014
And
therefore
I
have
sworn
unto
the
house
of
Eli,
that
the
iniquity
of
Eli's
house
shall
not
be
purged
with
sacrifice
nor
offering
for
ever.
003:015
And
Samuel
lay
until
the
morning,
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
And
Samuel
feared
to
shew
Eli
the
vision.
003:016
Then
Eli
called
Samuel,
and
said,
Samuel,
my
son.
And
he
answered,
Here
am
I.
003:017
And
he
said,
What
is
the
thing
that
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
thee?
I
pray
thee
hide
it
not
from
me:
God
do
so
to
thee,
and
more
also,
if
thou
hide
any
thing
from
me
of
all
the
things
that
he
said
unto
thee.
003:018
And
Samuel
told
him
every
whit,
and
hid
nothing
from
him.
And
he
said,
It
is
the
LORD:
let
him
do
what
seemeth
him
good.
003:019
And
Samuel
grew,
and
the
LORD
was
with
him,
and
did
let
none
of
his
words
fall
to
the
ground.
003:020
And
all
Israel
from
Dan
even
to
Beersheba
knew
that
Samuel
was
established
to
be
a
prophet
of
the
LORD.
003:021
And
the
LORD
appeared
again
in
Shiloh:
for
the
LORD
revealed
himself
to
Samuel
in
Shiloh
by
the
word
of
the
LORD.
004:001
And
the
word
of
Samuel
came
to
all
Israel.
Now
Israel
went
out
against
the
Philistines
to
battle,
and
pitched
beside
Ebenezer:
and
the
Philistines
pitched
in
Aphek.
004:002
And
the
Philistines
put
themselves
in
array
against
Israel:
and
when
they
joined
battle,
Israel
was
smitten
before
the
Philistines:
and
they
slew
of
the
army
in
the
field
about
four
thousand
men.
004:003
And
when
the
people
were
come
into
the
camp,
the
elders
of
Israel
said,
Wherefore
hath
the
LORD
smitten
us
to
day
before
the
Philistines?
Let
us
fetch
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
out
of
Shiloh
unto
us,
that,
when
it
cometh
among
us,
it
may
save
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies.
004:004
So
the
people
sent
to
Shiloh,
that
they
might
bring
from
thence
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
which
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims:
and
the
two
sons
of
Eli,
Hophni
and
Phinehas,
were
there
with
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
God.
004:005
And
when
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
came
into
the
camp,
all
Israel
shouted
with
a
great
shout,
so
that
the
earth
rang
again.
004:006
And
when
the
Philistines
heard
the
noise
of
the
shout,
they
said,
What
meaneth
the
noise
of
this
great
shout
in
the
camp
of
the
Hebrews?
And
they
understood
that
the
ark
of
the
LORD
was
come
into
the
camp.
004:007
And
the
Philistines
were
afraid,
for
they
said,
God
is
come
into
the
camp.
And
they
said,
Woe
unto
us!
for
there
hath
not
been
such
a
thing
heretofore.
004:008
Woe
unto
us!
who
shall
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
these
mighty
Gods?
these
are
the
Gods
that
smote
the
Egyptians
with
all
the
plagues
in
the
wilderness.
004:009
Be
strong
and
quit
yourselves
like
men,
O
ye
Philistines,
that
ye
be
not
servants
unto
the
Hebrews,
as
they
have
been
to
you:
quit
yourselves
like
men,
and
fight.
004:010
And
the
Philistines
fought,
and
Israel
was
smitten,
and
they
fled
every
man
into
his
tent:
and
there
was
a
very
great
slaughter;
for
there
fell
of
Israel
thirty
thousand
footmen.
004:011
And
the
ark
of
God
was
taken;
and
the
two
sons
of
Eli,
Hophni
and
Phinehas,
were
slain.
004:012
And
there
ran
a
man
of
Benjamin
out
of
the
army,
and
came
to
Shiloh
the
same
day
with
his
clothes
rent,
and
with
earth
upon
his
head.
004:013
And
when
he
came,
lo,
Eli
sat
upon
a
seat
by
the
wayside
watching:
for
his
heart
trembled
for
the
ark
of
God.
And
when
the
man
came
into
the
city,
and
told
it,
all
the
city
cried
out.
004:014
And
when
Eli
heard
the
noise
of
the
crying,
he
said,
What
meaneth
the
noise
of
this
tumult?
And
the
man
came
in
hastily,
and
told
Eli.
004:015
Now
Eli
was
ninety
and
eight
years
old;
and
his
eyes
were
dim,
that
he
could
not
see.
004:016
And
the
man
said
unto
Eli,
I
am
he
that
came
out
of
the
army,
and
I
fled
to
day
out
of
the
army.
And
he
said,
What
is
there
done,
my
son?
004:017
And
the
messenger
answered
and
said,
Israel
is
fled
before
the
Philistines,
and
there
hath
been
also
a
great
slaughter
among
the
people,
and
thy
two
sons
also,
Hophni
and
Phinehas,
are
dead,
and
the
ark
of
God
is
taken.
004:018
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
made
mention
of
the
ark
of
God,
that
he
fell
from
off
the
seat
backward
by
the
side
of
the
gate,
and
his
neck
brake,
and
he
died:
for
he
was
an
old
man,
and
heavy.
And
he
had
judged
Israel
forty
years.
004:019
And
his
daughter
in
law,
Phinehas'
wife,
was
with
child,
near
to
be
delivered:
and
when
she
heard
the
tidings
that
the
ark
of
God
was
taken,
and
that
her
father
in
law
and
her
husband
were
dead,
she
bowed
herself
and
travailed;
for
her
pains
came
upon
her.
004:020
And
about
the
time
of
her
death
the
women
that
stood
by
her
said
unto
her,
Fear
not;
for
thou
hast
born
a
son.
But
she
answered
not,
neither
did
she
regard
it.
004:021
And
she
named
the
child
Ichabod,
saying,
The
glory
is
departed
from
Israel:
because
the
ark
of
God
was
taken,
and
because
of
her
father
in
law
and
her
husband.
004:022
And
she
said,
The
glory
is
departed
from
Israel:
for
the
ark
of
God
is
taken.
005:001
And
the
Philistines
took
the
ark
of
God,
and
brought
it
from
Ebenezer
unto
Ashdod.
005:002
When
the
Philistines
took
the
ark
of
God,
they
brought
it
into
the
house
of
Dagon,
and
set
it
by
Dagon.
005:003
And
when
they
of
Ashdod
arose
early
on
the
morrow,
behold,
Dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
to
the
earth
before
the
ark
of
the
LORD.
And
they
took
Dagon,
and
set
him
in
his
place
again.
005:004
And
when
they
arose
early
on
the
morrow
morning,
behold,
Dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
ark
of
the
LORD;
and
the
head
of
Dagon
and
both
the
palms
of
his
hands
were
cut
off
upon
the
threshold;
only
the
stump
of
Dagon
was
left
to
him.
005:005
Therefore
neither
the
priests
of
Dagon,
nor
any
that
come
into
Dagon's
house,
tread
on
the
threshold
of
Dagon
in
Ashdod
unto
this
day.
005:006
But
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
heavy
upon
them
of
Ashdod,
and
he
destroyed
them,
and
smote
them
with
emerods,
even
Ashdod
and
the
coasts
thereof.
005:007
And
when
the
men
of
Ashdod
saw
that
it
was
so,
they
said,
The
ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
shall
not
abide
with
us:
for
his
hand
is
sore
upon
us,
and
upon
Dagon
our
god.
005:008
They
sent
therefore
and
gathered
all
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
unto
them,
and
said,
What
shall
we
do
with
the
ark
of
the
God
of
Israel?
And
they
answered,
Let
the
ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
be
carried
about
unto
Gath.
And
they
carried
the
ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
about
thither.
005:009
And
it
was
so,
that,
after
they
had
carried
it
about,
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
against
the
city
with
a
very
great
destruction:
and
he
smote
the
men
of
the
city,
both
small
and
great,
and
they
had
emerods
in
their
secret
parts.
005:010
Therefore
they
sent
the
ark
of
God
to
Ekron.
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
the
ark
of
God
came
to
Ekron,
that
the
Ekronites
cried
out,
saying,
They
have
brought
about
the
ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
to
us,
to
slay
us
and
our
people.
005:011
So
they
sent
and
gathered
together
all
the
lords
of
the
Philistines,
and
said,
Send
away
the
ark
of
the
God
of
Israel,
and
let
it
go
again
to
his
own
place,
that
it
slay
us
not,
and
our
people:
for
there
was
a
deadly
destruction
throughout
all
the
city;
the
hand
of
God
was
very
heavy
there.
005:012
And
the
men
that
died
not
were
smitten
with
the
emerods:
and
the
cry
of
the
city
went
up
to
heaven.
006:001
And
the
ark
of
the
LORD
was
in
the
country
of
the
Philistines
seven
months.
006:002
And
the
Philistines
called
for
the
priests
and
the
diviners,
saying,
What
shall
we
do
to
the
ark
of
the
LORD?
tell
us
wherewith
we
shall
send
it
to
his
place.
006:003
And
they
said,
If
ye
send
away
the
ark
of
the
God
of
Israel,
send
it
not
empty;
but
in
any
wise
return
him
a
trespass
offering:
then
ye
shall
be
healed,
and
it
shall
be
known
to
you
why
his
hand
is
not
removed
from
you.
006:004
Then
said
they,
What
shall
be
the
trespass
offering
which
we
shall
return
to
him?
They
answered,
Five
golden
emerods,
and
five
golden
mice,
according
to
the
number
of
the
lords
of
the
Philistines:
for
one
plague
was
on
you
all,
and
on
your
lords.
006:005
Wherefore
ye
shall
make
images
of
your
emerods,
and
images
of
your
mice
that
mar
the
land;
and
ye
shall
give
glory
unto
the
God
of
Israel:
peradventure
he
will
lighten
his
hand
from
off
you,
and
from
off
your
gods,
and
from
off
your
land.
006:006
Wherefore
then
do
ye
harden
your
hearts,
as
the
Egyptians
and
Pharaoh
hardened
their
hearts?
when
he
had
wrought
wonderfully
among
them,
did
they
not
let
the
people
go,
and
they
departed?
006:007
Now
therefore
make
a
new
cart,
and
take
two
milch
kine,
on
which
there
hath
come
no
yoke,
and
tie
the
kine
to
the
cart,
and
bring
their
calves
home
from
them:
006:008
And
take
the
ark
of
the
LORD,
and
lay
it
upon
the
cart;
and
put
the
jewels
of
gold,
which
ye
return
him
for
a
trespass
offering,
in
a
coffer
by
the
side
thereof;
and
send
it
away,
that
it
may
go.
006:009
And
see,
if
it
goeth
up
by
the
way
of
his
own
coast
to
Bethshemesh,
then
he
hath
done
us
this
great
evil:
but
if
not,
then
we
shall
know
that
it
is
not
his
hand
that
smote
us:
it
was
a
chance
that
happened
to
us.
006:010
And
the
men
did
so;
and
took
two
milch
kine,
and
tied
them
to
the
cart,
and
shut
up
their
calves
at
home:
006:011
And
they
laid
the
ark
of
the
LORD
upon
the
cart,
and
the
coffer
with
the
mice
of
gold
and
the
images
of
their
emerods.
006:012
And
the
kine
took
the
straight
way
to
the
way
of
Bethshemesh,
and
went
along
the
highway,
lowing
as
they
went,
and
turned
not
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left;
and
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
went
after
them
unto
the
border
of
Bethshemesh.
006:013
And
they
of
Bethshemesh
were
reaping
their
wheat
harvest
in
the
valley:
and
they
lifted
up
their
eyes,
and
saw
the
ark,
and
rejoiced
to
see
it.
006:014
And
the
cart
came
into
the
field
of
Joshua,
a
Bethshemite,
and
stood
there,
where
there
was
a
great
stone:
and
they
clave
the
wood
of
the
cart,
and
offered
the
kine
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
LORD.
006:015
And
the
Levites
took
down
the
ark
of
the
LORD,
and
the
coffer
that
was
with
it,
wherein
the
jewels
of
gold
were,
and
put
them
on
the
great
stone:
and
the
men
of
Bethshemesh
offered
burnt
offerings
and
sacrificed
sacrifices
the
same
day
unto
the
LORD.
006:016
And
when
the
five
lords
of
the
Philistines
had
seen
it,
they
returned
to
Ekron
the
same
day.
006:017
And
these
are
the
golden
emerods
which
the
Philistines
returned
for
a
trespass
offering
unto
the
LORD;
for
Ashdod
one,
for
Gaza
one,
for
Askelon
one,
for
Gath
one,
for
Ekron
one;
006:018
And
