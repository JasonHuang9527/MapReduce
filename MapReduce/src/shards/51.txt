the
golden
mice,
according
to
the
number
of
all
the
cities
of
the
Philistines
belonging
to
the
five
lords,
both
of
fenced
cities,
and
of
country
villages,
even
unto
the
great
stone
of
Abel,
whereon
they
set
down
the
ark
of
the
LORD:
which
stone
remaineth
unto
this
day
in
the
field
of
Joshua,
the
Bethshemite.
006:019
And
he
smote
the
men
of
Bethshemesh,
because
they
had
looked
into
the
ark
of
the
LORD,
even
he
smote
of
the
people
fifty
thousand
and
threescore
and
ten
men:
and
the
people
lamented,
because
the
LORD
had
smitten
many
of
the
people
with
a
great
slaughter.
006:020
And
the
men
of
Bethshemesh
said,
Who
is
able
to
stand
before
this
holy
LORD
God?
and
to
whom
shall
he
go
up
from
us?
006:021
And
they
sent
messengers
to
the
inhabitants
of
Kirjathjearim,
saying,
The
Philistines
have
brought
again
the
ark
of
the
LORD;
come
ye
down,
and
fetch
it
up
to
you.
007:001
And
the
men
of
Kirjathjearim
came,
and
fetched
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD,
and
brought
it
into
the
house
of
Abinadab
in
the
hill,
and
sanctified
Eleazar
his
son
to
keep
the
ark
of
the
LORD.
007:002
And
it
came
to
pass,
while
the
ark
abode
in
Kirjathjearim,
that
the
time
was
long;
for
it
was
twenty
years:
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
lamented
after
the
LORD.
007:003
And
Samuel
spake
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel,
saying,
If
ye
do
return
unto
the
LORD
with
all
your
hearts,
then
put
away
the
strange
gods
and
Ashtaroth
from
among
you,
and
prepare
your
hearts
unto
the
LORD,
and
serve
him
only:
and
he
will
deliver
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines.
007:004
Then
the
children
of
Israel
did
put
away
Baalim
and
Ashtaroth,
and
served
the
LORD
only.
007:005
And
Samuel
said,
Gather
all
Israel
to
Mizpeh,
and
I
will
pray
for
you
unto
the
LORD.
007:006
And
they
gathered
together
to
Mizpeh,
and
drew
water,
and
poured
it
out
before
the
LORD,
and
fasted
on
that
day,
and
said
there,
We
have
sinned
against
the
LORD.
And
Samuel
judged
the
children
of
Israel
in
Mizpeh.
007:007
And
when
the
Philistines
heard
that
the
children
of
Israel
were
gathered
together
to
Mizpeh,
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
went
up
against
Israel.
And
when
the
children
of
Israel
heard
it,
they
were
afraid
of
the
Philistines.
007:008
And
the
children
of
Israel
said
to
Samuel,
Cease
not
to
cry
unto
the
LORD
our
God
for
us,
that
he
will
save
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines.
007:009
And
Samuel
took
a
sucking
lamb,
and
offered
it
for
a
burnt
offering
wholly
unto
the
LORD:
and
Samuel
cried
unto
the
LORD
for
Israel;
and
the
LORD
heard
him.
007:010
And
as
Samuel
was
offering
up
the
burnt
offering,
the
Philistines
drew
near
to
battle
against
Israel:
but
the
LORD
thundered
with
a
great
thunder
on
that
day
upon
the
Philistines,
and
discomfited
them;
and
they
were
smitten
before
Israel.
007:011
And
the
men
of
Israel
went
out
of
Mizpeh,
and
pursued
the
Philistines,
and
smote
them,
until
they
came
under
Bethcar.
007:012
Then
Samuel
took
a
stone,
and
set
it
between
Mizpeh
and
Shen,
and
called
the
name
of
it
Ebenezer,
saying,
Hitherto
hath
the
LORD
helped
us.
007:013
So
the
Philistines
were
subdued,
and
they
came
no
more
into
the
coast
of
Israel:
and
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
against
the
Philistines
all
the
days
of
Samuel.
007:014
And
the
cities
which
the
Philistines
had
taken
from
Israel
were
restored
to
Israel,
from
Ekron
even
unto
Gath;
and
the
coasts
thereof
did
Israel
deliver
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Philistines.
And
there
was
peace
between
Israel
and
the
Amorites.
007:015
And
Samuel
judged
Israel
all
the
days
of
his
life.
007:016
And
he
went
from
year
to
year
in
circuit
to
Bethel,
and
Gilgal,
and
Mizpeh,
and
judged
Israel
in
all
those
places.
007:017
And
his
return
was
to
Ramah;
for
there
was
his
house;
and
there
he
judged
Israel;
and
there
he
built
an
altar
unto
the
LORD.
008:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Samuel
was
old,
that
he
made
his
sons
judges
over
Israel.
008:002
Now
the
name
of
his
firstborn
was
Joel;
and
the
name
of
his
second,
Abiah:
they
were
judges
in
Beersheba.
008:003
And
his
sons
walked
not
in
his
ways,
but
turned
aside
after
lucre,
and
took
bribes,
and
perverted
judgment.
008:004
Then
all
the
elders
of
Israel
gathered
themselves
together,
and
came
to
Samuel
unto
Ramah,
008:005
And
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thou
art
old,
and
thy
sons
walk
not
in
thy
ways:
now
make
us
a
king
to
judge
us
like
all
the
nations.
008:006
But
the
thing
displeased
Samuel,
when
they
said,
Give
us
a
king
to
judge
us.
And
Samuel
prayed
unto
the
LORD.
008:007
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Samuel,
Hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
people
in
all
that
they
say
unto
thee:
for
they
have
not
rejected
thee,
but
they
have
rejected
me,
that
I
should
not
reign
over
them.
008:008
According
to
all
the
works
which
they
have
done
since
the
day
that
I
brought
them
up
out
of
Egypt
even
unto
this
day,
wherewith
they
have
forsaken
me,
and
served
other
gods,
so
do
they
also
unto
thee.
008:009
Now
therefore
hearken
unto
their
voice:
howbeit
yet
protest
solemnly
unto
them,
and
shew
them
the
manner
of
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
them.
008:010
And
Samuel
told
all
the
words
of
the
LORD
unto
the
people
that
asked
of
him
a
king.
008:011
And
he
said,
This
will
be
the
manner
of
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
you:
He
will
take
your
sons,
and
appoint
them
for
himself,
for
his
chariots,
and
to
be
his
horsemen;
and
some
shall
run
before
his
chariots.
008:012
And
he
will
appoint
him
captains
over
thousands,
and
captains
over
fifties;
and
will
set
them
to
ear
his
ground,
and
to
reap
his
harvest,
and
to
make
his
instruments
of
war,
and
instruments
of
his
chariots.
008:013
And
he
will
take
your
daughters
to
be
confectionaries,
and
to
be
cooks,
and
to
be
bakers.
008:014
And
he
will
take
your
fields,
and
your
vineyards,
and
your
oliveyards,
even
the
best
of
them,
and
give
them
to
his
servants.
008:015
And
he
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
seed,
and
of
your
vineyards,
and
give
to
his
officers,
and
to
his
servants.
008:016
And
he
will
take
your
menservants,
and
your
maidservants,
and
your
goodliest
young
men,
and
your
asses,
and
put
them
to
his
work.
008:017
He
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
sheep:
and
ye
shall
be
his
servants.
008:018
And
ye
shall
cry
out
in
that
day
because
of
your
king
which
ye
shall
have
chosen
you;
and
the
LORD
will
not
hear
you
in
that
day.
008:019
Nevertheless
the
people
refused
to
obey
the
voice
of
Samuel;
and
they
said,
Nay;
but
we
will
have
a
king
over
us;
008:020
That
we
also
may
be
like
all
the
nations;
and
that
our
king
may
judge
us,
and
go
out
before
us,
and
fight
our
battles.
008:021
And
Samuel
heard
all
the
words
of
the
people,
and
he
rehearsed
them
in
the
ears
of
the
LORD.
008:022
And
the
LORD
said
to
Samuel,
Hearken
unto
their
voice,
and
make
them
a
king.
And
Samuel
said
unto
the
men
of
Israel,
Go
ye
every
man
unto
his
city.
009:001
Now
there
was
a
man
of
Benjamin,
whose
name
was
Kish,
the
son
of
Abiel,
the
son
of
Zeror,
the
son
of
Bechorath,
the
son
of
Aphiah,
a
Benjamite,
a
mighty
man
of
power.
009:002
And
he
had
a
son,
whose
name
was
Saul,
a
choice
young
man,
and
a
goodly:
and
there
was
not
among
the
children
of
Israel
a
goodlier
person
than
he:
from
his
shoulders
and
upward
he
was
higher
than
any
of
the
people.
009:003
And
the
asses
of
Kish
Saul's
father
were
lost.
And
Kish
said
to
Saul
his
son,
Take
now
one
of
the
servants
with
thee,
and
arise,
go
seek
the
asses.
009:004
And
he
passed
through
mount
Ephraim,
and
passed
through
the
land
of
Shalisha,
but
they
found
them
not:
then
they
passed
through
the
land
of
Shalim,
and
there
they
were
not:
and
he
passed
through
the
land
of
the
Benjamites,
but
they
found
them
not.
009:005
And
when
they
were
come
to
the
land
of
Zuph,
Saul
said
to
his
servant
that
was
with
him,
Come,
and
let
us
return;
lest
my
father
leave
caring
for
the
asses,
and
take
thought
for
us.
009:006
And
he
said
unto
him,
Behold
now,
there
is
in
this
city
a
man
of
God,
and
he
is
an
honourable
man;
all
that
he
saith
cometh
surely
to
pass:
now
let
us
go
thither;
peradventure
he
can
shew
us
our
way
that
we
should
go.
009:007
Then
said
Saul
to
his
servant,
But,
behold,
if
we
go,
what
shall
we
bring
the
man?
for
the
bread
is
spent
in
our
vessels,
and
there
is
not
a
present
to
bring
to
the
man
of
God:
what
have
we?
009:008
And
the
servant
answered
Saul
again,
and
said,
Behold,
I
have
here
at
hand
the
fourth
part
of
a
shekel
of
silver:
that
will
I
give
to
the
man
of
God,
to
tell
us
our
way.
009:009
(Beforetime
in
Israel,
when
a
man
went
to
enquire
of
God,
thus
he
spake,
Come,
and
let
us
go
to
the
seer:
for
he
that
is
now
called
a
Prophet
was
beforetime
called
a
Seer.)
009:010
Then
said
Saul
to
his
servant,
Well
said;
come,
let
us
go.
So
they
went
unto
the
city
where
the
man
of
God
was.
009:011
And
as
they
went
up
the
hill
to
the
city,
they
found
young
maidens
going
out
to
draw
water,
and
said
unto
them,
Is
the
seer
here?
009:012
And
they
answered
them,
and
said,
He
is;
behold,
he
is
before
you:
make
haste
now,
for
he
came
to
day
to
the
city;
for
there
is
a
sacrifice
of
the
people
to
day
in
the
high
place:
009:013
As
soon
as
ye
be
come
into
the
city,
ye
shall
straightway
find
him,
before
he
go
up
to
the
high
place
to
eat:
for
the
people
will
not
eat
until
he
come,
because
he
doth
bless
the
sacrifice;
and
afterwards
they
eat
that
be
bidden.
Now
therefore
get
you
up;
for
about
this
time
ye
shall
find
him.
009:014
And
they
went
up
into
the
city:
and
when
they
were
come
into
the
city,
behold,
Samuel
came
out
against
them,
for
to
go
up
to
the
high
place.
009:015
Now
the
LORD
had
told
Samuel
in
his
ear
a
day
before
Saul
came,
saying,
009:016
To
morrow
about
this
time
I
will
send
thee
a
man
out
of
the
land
of
Benjamin,
and
thou
shalt
anoint
him
to
be
captain
over
my
people
Israel,
that
he
may
save
my
people
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines:
for
I
have
looked
upon
my
people,
because
their
cry
is
come
unto
me.
009:017
And
when
Samuel
saw
Saul,
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Behold
the
man
whom
I
spake
to
thee
of!
this
same
shall
reign
over
my
people.
009:018
Then
Saul
drew
near
to
Samuel
in
the
gate,
and
said,
Tell
me,
I
pray
thee,
where
the
seer's
house
is.
009:019
And
Samuel
answered
Saul,
and
said,
I
am
the
seer:
go
up
before
me
unto
the
high
place;
for
ye
shall
eat
with
me
to
day,
and
to
morrow
I
will
let
thee
go,
and
will
tell
thee
all
that
is
in
thine
heart.
009:020
And
as
for
thine
asses
that
were
lost
three
days
ago,
set
not
thy
mind
on
them;
for
they
are
found.
And
on
whom
is
all
the
desire
of
Israel?
Is
it
not
on
thee,
and
on
all
thy
father's
house?
009:021
And
Saul
answered
and
said,
Am
not
I
a
Benjamite,
of
the
smallest
of
the
tribes
of
Israel?
and
my
family
the
least
of
all
the
families
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin?
wherefore
then
speakest
thou
so
to
me?
009:022
And
Samuel
took
Saul
and
his
servant,
and
brought
them
into
the
parlour,
and
made
them
sit
in
the
chiefest
place
among
them
that
were
bidden,
which
were
about
thirty
persons.
009:023
And
Samuel
said
unto
the
cook,
Bring
the
portion
which
I
gave
thee,
of
which
I
said
unto
thee,
Set
it
by
thee.
009:024
And
the
cook
took
up
the
shoulder,
and
that
which
was
upon
it,
and
set
it
before
Saul.
And
Samuel
said,
Behold
that
which
is
left!
set
it
before
thee,
and
eat:
for
unto
this
time
hath
it
been
kept
for
thee
since
I
said,
I
have
invited
the
people.
So
Saul
did
eat
with
Samuel
that
day.
009:025
And
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
high
place
into
the
city,
Samuel
communed
with
Saul
upon
the
top
of
the
house.
009:026
And
they
arose
early:
and
it
came
to
pass
about
the
spring
of
the
day,
that
Samuel
called
Saul
to
the
top
of
the
house,
saying,
Up,
that
I
may
send
thee
away.
And
Saul
arose,
and
they
went
out
both
of
them,
he
and
Samuel,
abroad.
009:027
And
as
they
were
going
down
to
the
end
of
the
city,
Samuel
said
to
Saul,
Bid
the
servant
pass
on
before
us,
(and
he
passed
on),
but
stand
thou
still
a
while,
that
I
may
shew
thee
the
word
of
God.
010:001
Then
Samuel
took
a
vial
of
oil,
and
poured
it
upon
his
head,
and
kissed
him,
and
said,
Is
it
not
because
the
LORD
hath
anointed
thee
to
be
captain
over
his
inheritance?
010:002
When
thou
art
departed
from
me
to
day,
then
thou
shalt
find
two
men
by
Rachel's
sepulchre
in
the
border
of
Benjamin
at
Zelzah;
and
they
will
say
unto
thee,
The
asses
which
thou
wentest
to
seek
are
found:
and,
lo,
thy
father
hath
left
the
care
of
the
asses,
and
sorroweth
for
you,
saying,
What
shall
I
do
for
my
son?
010:003
Then
shalt
thou
go
on
forward
from
thence,
and
thou
shalt
come
to
the
plain
of
Tabor,
and
there
shall
meet
thee
three
men
going
up
to
God
to
Bethel,
one
carrying
three
kids,
and
another
carrying
three
loaves
of
bread,
and
another
carrying
a
bottle
of
wine:
010:004
And
they
will
salute
thee,
and
give
thee
two
loaves
of
bread;
which
thou
shalt
receive
of
their
hands.
010:005
After
that
thou
shalt
come
to
the
hill
of
God,
where
is
the
garrison
of
the
Philistines:
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
thou
art
come
thither
to
the
city,
that
thou
shalt
meet
a
company
of
prophets
coming
down
from
the
high
place
with
a
psaltery,
and
a
tabret,
and
a
pipe,
and
a
harp,
before
them;
and
they
shall
prophesy:
010:006
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
will
come
upon
thee,
and
thou
shalt
prophesy
with
them,
and
shalt
be
turned
into
another
man.
010:007
And
let
it
be,
when
these
signs
are
come
unto
thee,
that
thou
do
as
occasion
serve
thee;
for
God
is
with
thee.
010:008
And
thou
shalt
go
down
before
me
to
Gilgal;
and,
behold,
I
will
come
down
unto
thee,
to
offer
burnt
offerings,
and
to
sacrifice
sacrifices
of
peace
offerings:
seven
days
shalt
thou
tarry,
till
I
come
to
thee,
and
shew
thee
what
thou
shalt
do.
010:009
And
it
was
so,
that
when
he
had
turned
his
back
to
go
from
Samuel,
God
gave
him
another
heart:
and
all
those
signs
came
to
pass
that
day.
010:010
And
when
they
came
thither
to
the
hill,
behold,
a
company
of
prophets
met
him;
and
the
Spirit
of
God
came
upon
him,
and
he
prophesied
among
them.
010:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
all
that
knew
him
beforetime
saw
that,
behold,
he
prophesied
among
the
prophets,
then
the
people
said
one
to
another,
What
is
this
that
is
come
unto
the
son
of
Kish?
Is
Saul
also
among
the
prophets?
010:012
And
one
of
the
same
place
answered
and
said,
But
who
is
their
father?
Therefore
it
became
a
proverb,
Is
Saul
also
among
the
prophets?
010:013
And
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
prophesying,
he
came
to
the
high
place.
010:014
And
Saul's
uncle
said
unto
him
and
to
his
servant,
Whither
went
ye?
And
he
said,
To
seek
the
asses:
and
when
we
saw
that
they
were
no
where,
we
came
to
Samuel.
010:015
And
Saul's
uncle
said,
Tell
me,
I
pray
thee,
what
Samuel
said
unto
you.
010:016
And
Saul
said
unto
his
uncle,
He
told
us
plainly
that
the
asses
were
found.
But
of
the
matter
of
the
kingdom,
whereof
Samuel
spake,
he
told
him
not.
010:017
And
Samuel
called
the
people
together
unto
the
LORD
to
Mizpeh;
010:018
And
said
unto
the
children
of
Israel,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
I
brought
up
Israel
out
of
Egypt,
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians,
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
kingdoms,
and
of
them
that
oppressed
you:
010:019
And
ye
have
this
day
rejected
your
God,
who
himself
saved
you
out
of
all
your
adversities
and
your
tribulations;
and
ye
have
said
unto
him,
Nay,
but
set
a
king
over
us.
Now
therefore
present
yourselves
before
the
LORD
by
your
tribes,
and
by
your
thousands.
010:020
And
when
Samuel
had
caused
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
come
near,
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
was
taken.
010:021
When
he
had
caused
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
to
come
near
by
their
families,
the
family
of
Matri
was
taken,
and
Saul
the
son
of
Kish
was
taken:
and
when
they
sought
him,
he
could
not
be
found.
010:022
Therefore
they
enquired
of
the
LORD
further,
if
the
man
should
yet
come
thither.
And
the
LORD
answered,
Behold
he
hath
hid
himself
among
the
stuff.
010:023
And
they
ran
and
fetched
him
thence:
and
when
he
stood
among
the
people,
he
was
higher
than
any
of
the
people
from
his
shoulders
and
upward.
010:024
And
Samuel
said
to
all
the
people,
See
ye
him
whom
the
LORD
hath
chosen,
that
there
is
none
like
him
among
all
the
people?
And
all
the
people
shouted,
and
said,
God
save
the
king.
010:025
Then
Samuel
told
the
people
the
manner
of
the
kingdom,
and
wrote
it
in
a
book,
and
laid
it
up
before
the
LORD.
And
Samuel
sent
all
the
people
away,
every
man
to
his
house.
010:026
And
Saul
also
went
home
to
Gibeah;
and
there
went
with
him
a
band
of
men,
whose
hearts
God
had
touched.
010:027
But
the
children
of
Belial
said,
How
shall
this
man
save
us?
And
they
despised
him,
and
brought
no
presents.
But
he
held
his
peace.
011:001
Then
Nahash
the
Ammonite
came
up,
and
encamped
against
Jabeshgilead:
and
all
the
men
of
Jabesh
said
unto
Nahash,
Make
a
covenant
with
us,
and
we
will
serve
thee.
011:002
And
Nahash
the
Ammonite
answered
them,
On
this
condition
will
I
make
a
covenant
with
you,
that
I
may
thrust
out
all
your
right
eyes,
and
lay
it
for
a
reproach
upon
all
Israel.
011:003
And
the
elders
of
Jabesh
said
unto
him,
Give
us
seven
days'
respite,
that
we
may
send
messengers
unto
all
the
coasts
of
Israel:
and
then,
if
there
be
no
man
to
save
us,
we
will
come
out
to
thee.
011:004
Then
came
the
messengers
to
Gibeah
of
Saul,
and
told
the
tidings
in
the
ears
of
the
people:
and
all
the
people
lifted
up
their
voices,
and
wept.
011:005
And,
behold,
Saul
came
after
the
herd
out
of
the
field;
and
Saul
said,
What
aileth
the
people
that
they
weep?
And
they
told
him
the
tidings
of
the
men
of
Jabesh.
011:006
And
the
Spirit
of
God
came
upon
Saul
when
he
heard
those
tidings,
and
his
anger
was
kindled
greatly.
011:007
And
he
took
a
yoke
of
oxen,
and
hewed
them
in
pieces,
and
sent
them
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
Israel
by
the
hands
of
messengers,
saying,
Whosoever
cometh
not
forth
after
Saul
and
after
Samuel,
so
shall
it
be
done
unto
his
oxen.
And
the
fear
of
the
LORD
fell
on
the
people,
and
they
came
out
with
one
consent.
011:008
And
when
he
numbered
them
in
Bezek,
the
children
of
Israel
were
three
hundred
thousand,
and
the
men
of
Judah
thirty
thousand.
011:009
And
they
said
unto
the
messengers
that
came,
Thus
shall
ye
say
unto
the
men
of
Jabeshgilead,
To
morrow,
by
that
time
the
sun
be
hot,
ye
shall
have
help.
And
the
messengers
came
and
shewed
it
to
the
men
of
Jabesh;
and
they
were
glad.
011:010
Therefore
the
men
of
Jabesh
said,
To
morrow
we
will
come
out
unto
you,
and
ye
shall
do
with
us
all
that
seemeth
good
unto
you.
011:011
And
it
was
so
on
the
morrow,
that
Saul
put
the
people
in
three
companies;
and
they
came
into
the
midst
of
the
host
in
the
morning
watch,
and
slew
the
Ammonites
until
the
heat
of
the
day:
and
it
came
to
pass,
that
they
which
remained
were
scattered,
so
that
two
of
them
were
not
left
together.
011:012
And
the
people
said
unto
Samuel,
Who
is
he
that
said,
Shall
Saul
reign
over
us?
bring
the
men,
that
we
may
put
them
to
death.
011:013
And
Saul
said,
There
shall
not
a
man
be
put
to
death
this
day:
for
to
day
the
LORD
hath
wrought
salvation
in
Israel.
011:014
Then
said
Samuel
to
the
people,
Come,
and
let
us
go
to
Gilgal,
and
renew
the
kingdom
there.
011:015
And
all
the
people
went
to
Gilgal;
and
there
they
made
Saul
king
before
the
LORD
in
Gilgal;
and
there
they
sacrificed
sacrifices
of
peace
offerings
before
the
LORD;
and
there
Saul
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
rejoiced
greatly.
012:001
And
Samuel
said
unto
all
Israel,
Behold,
I
have
hearkened
unto
your
voice
in
all
that
ye
said
unto
me,
and
have
made
a
king
over
you.
012:002
And
now,
behold,
the
king
walketh
before
you:
and
I
am
old
and
grayheaded;
and,
behold,
my
sons
are
with
you:
and
I
have
walked
before
you
from
my
childhood
unto
this
day.
012:003
Behold,
here
I
am:
witness
against
me
before
the
LORD,
and
before
his
anointed:
whose
ox
have
I
taken?
or
whose
ass
have
I
taken?
or
whom
have
I
defrauded?
whom
have
I
oppressed?
or
of
whose
hand
have
I
received
any
bribe
to
blind
mine
eyes
therewith?
and
I
will
restore
it
you.
012:004
And
they
said,
Thou
hast
not
defrauded
us,
nor
oppressed
us,
neither
hast
thou
taken
ought
of
any
man's
hand.
012:005
And
he
said
unto
them,
The
LORD
is
witness
against
you,
and
his
anointed
is
witness
this
day,
that
ye
have
not
found
ought
in
my
hand.
And
they
answered,
He
is
witness.
012:006
And
Samuel
said
unto
the
people,
It
is
the
LORD
that
advanced
Moses
and
Aaron,
and
that
brought
your
fathers
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt.
012:007
Now
therefore
stand
still,
that
I
may
reason
with
you
before
the
LORD
of
all
the
righteous
acts
of
the
LORD,
which
he
did
to
you
and
to
your
fathers.
012:008
When
Jacob
was
come
into
Egypt,
and
your
fathers
cried
unto
the
LORD,
then
the
LORD
sent
Moses
and
Aaron,
which
brought
forth
your
fathers
out
of
Egypt,
and
made
them
dwell
in
this
place.
012:009
And
when
they
forgat
the
LORD
their
God,
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
Sisera,
captain
of
the
host
of
Hazor,
and
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines,
and
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Moab,
and
they
fought
against
them.
012:010
And
they
cried
unto
the
LORD,
and
said,
We
have
sinned,
because
we
have
forsaken
the
LORD,
and
have
served
Baalim
and
Ashtaroth:
but
now
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies,
and
we
will
serve
thee.
012:011
And
the
LORD
sent
Jerubbaal,
and
Bedan,
and
Jephthah,
and
Samuel,
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
your
enemies
on
every
side,
and
ye
dwelled
safe.
012:012
And
when
ye
saw
that
Nahash
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon
came
against
you,
ye
said
unto
me,
Nay;
but
a
king
shall
reign
over
us:
when
the
LORD
your
God
was
your
king.
012:013
Now
therefore
behold
the
