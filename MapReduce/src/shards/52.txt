king
whom
ye
have
chosen,
and
whom
ye
have
desired!
and,
behold,
the
LORD
hath
set
a
king
over
you.
012:014
If
ye
will
fear
the
LORD,
and
serve
him,
and
obey
his
voice,
and
not
rebel
against
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
then
shall
both
ye
and
also
the
king
that
reigneth
over
you
continue
following
the
LORD
your
God:
012:015
But
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD,
but
rebel
against
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
then
shall
the
hand
of
the
LORD
be
against
you,
as
it
was
against
your
fathers.
012:016
Now
therefore
stand
and
see
this
great
thing,
which
the
LORD
will
do
before
your
eyes.
012:017
Is
it
not
wheat
harvest
to
day?
I
will
call
unto
the
LORD,
and
he
shall
send
thunder
and
rain;
that
ye
may
perceive
and
see
that
your
wickedness
is
great,
which
ye
have
done
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
in
asking
you
a
king.
012:018
So
Samuel
called
unto
the
LORD;
and
the
LORD
sent
thunder
and
rain
that
day:
and
all
the
people
greatly
feared
the
LORD
and
Samuel.
012:019
And
all
the
people
said
unto
Samuel,
Pray
for
thy
servants
unto
the
LORD
thy
God,
that
we
die
not:
for
we
have
added
unto
all
our
sins
this
evil,
to
ask
us
a
king.
012:020
And
Samuel
said
unto
the
people,
Fear
not:
ye
have
done
all
this
wickedness:
yet
turn
not
aside
from
following
the
LORD,
but
serve
the
LORD
with
all
your
heart;
012:021
And
turn
ye
not
aside:
for
then
should
ye
go
after
vain
things,
which
cannot
profit
nor
deliver;
for
they
are
vain.
012:022
For
the
LORD
will
not
forsake
his
people
for
his
great
name's
sake:
because
it
hath
pleased
the
LORD
to
make
you
his
people.
012:023
Moreover
as
for
me,
God
forbid
that
I
should
sin
against
the
LORD
in
ceasing
to
pray
for
you:
but
I
will
teach
you
the
good
and
the
right
way:
012:024
Only
fear
the
LORD,
and
serve
him
in
truth
with
all
your
heart:
for
consider
how
great
things
he
hath
done
for
you.
012:025
But
if
ye
shall
still
do
wickedly,
ye
shall
be
consumed,
both
ye
and
your
king.
013:001
Saul
reigned
one
year;
and
when
he
had
reigned
two
years
over
Israel,
013:002
Saul
chose
him
three
thousand
men
of
Israel;
whereof
two
thousand
were
with
Saul
in
Michmash
and
in
mount
Bethel,
and
a
thousand
were
with
Jonathan
in
Gibeah
of
Benjamin:
and
the
rest
of
the
people
he
sent
every
man
to
his
tent.
013:003
And
Jonathan
smote
the
garrison
of
the
Philistines
that
was
in
Geba,
and
the
Philistines
heard
of
it.
And
Saul
blew
the
trumpet
throughout
all
the
land,
saying,
Let
the
Hebrews
hear.
013:004
And
all
Israel
heard
say
that
Saul
had
smitten
a
garrison
of
the
Philistines,
and
that
Israel
also
was
had
in
abomination
with
the
Philistines.
And
the
people
were
called
together
after
Saul
to
Gilgal.
013:005
And
the
Philistines
gathered
themselves
together
to
fight
with
Israel,
thirty
thousand
chariots,
and
six
thousand
horsemen,
and
people
as
the
sand
which
is
on
the
sea
shore
in
multitude:
and
they
came
up,
and
pitched
in
Michmash,
eastward
from
Bethaven.
013:006
When
the
men
of
Israel
saw
that
they
were
in
a
strait,
(for
the
people
were
distressed,)
then
the
people
did
hide
themselves
in
caves,
and
in
thickets,
and
in
rocks,
and
in
high
places,
and
in
pits.
013:007
And
some
of
the
Hebrews
went
over
Jordan
to
the
land
of
Gad
and
Gilead.
As
for
Saul,
he
was
yet
in
Gilgal,
and
all
the
people
followed
him
trembling.
013:008
And
he
tarried
seven
days,
according
to
the
set
time
that
Samuel
had
appointed:
but
Samuel
came
not
to
Gilgal;
and
the
people
were
scattered
from
him.
013:009
And
Saul
said,
Bring
hither
a
burnt
offering
to
me,
and
peace
offerings.
And
he
offered
the
burnt
offering.
013:010
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offering,
behold,
Samuel
came;
and
Saul
went
out
to
meet
him,
that
he
might
salute
him.
013:011
And
Samuel
said,
What
hast
thou
done?
And
Saul
said,
Because
I
saw
that
the
people
were
scattered
from
me,
and
that
thou
camest
not
within
the
days
appointed,
and
that
the
Philistines
gathered
themselves
together
at
Michmash;
013:012
Therefore
said
I,
The
Philistines
will
come
down
now
upon
me
to
Gilgal,
and
I
have
not
made
supplication
unto
the
LORD:
I
forced
myself
therefore,
and
offered
a
burnt
offering.
013:013
And
Samuel
said
to
Saul,
Thou
hast
done
foolishly:
thou
hast
not
kept
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
he
commanded
thee:
for
now
would
the
LORD
have
established
thy
kingdom
upon
Israel
for
ever.
013:014
But
now
thy
kingdom
shall
not
continue:
the
LORD
hath
sought
him
a
man
after
his
own
heart,
and
the
LORD
hath
commanded
him
to
be
captain
over
his
people,
because
thou
hast
not
kept
that
which
the
LORD
commanded
thee.
013:015
And
Samuel
arose,
and
gat
him
up
from
Gilgal
unto
Gibeah
of
Benjamin.
And
Saul
numbered
the
people
that
were
present
with
him,
about
six
hundred
men.
013:016
And
Saul,
and
Jonathan
his
son,
and
the
people
that
were
present
with
them,
abode
in
Gibeah
of
Benjamin:
but
the
Philistines
encamped
in
Michmash.
013:017
And
the
spoilers
came
out
of
the
camp
of
the
Philistines
in
three
companies:
one
company
turned
unto
the
way
that
leadeth
to
Ophrah,
unto
the
land
of
Shual:
013:018
And
another
company
turned
the
way
to
Bethhoron:
and
another
company
turned
to
the
way
of
the
border
that
looketh
to
the
valley
of
Zeboim
toward
the
wilderness.
013:019
Now
there
was
no
smith
found
throughout
all
the
land
of
Israel:
for
the
Philistines
said,
Lest
the
Hebrews
make
them
swords
or
spears:
013:020
But
all
the
Israelites
went
down
to
the
Philistines,
to
sharpen
every
man
his
share,
and
his
coulter,
and
his
axe,
and
his
mattock.
013:021
Yet
they
had
a
file
for
the
mattocks,
and
for
the
coulters,
and
for
the
forks,
and
for
the
axes,
and
to
sharpen
the
goads.
013:022
So
it
came
to
pass
in
the
day
of
battle,
that
there
was
neither
sword
nor
spear
found
in
the
hand
of
any
of
the
people
that
were
with
Saul
and
Jonathan:
but
with
Saul
and
with
Jonathan
his
son
was
there
found.
013:023
And
the
garrison
of
the
Philistines
went
out
to
the
passage
of
Michmash.
014:001
Now
it
came
to
pass
upon
a
day,
that
Jonathan
the
son
of
Saul
said
unto
the
young
man
that
bare
his
armour,
Come,
and
let
us
go
over
to
the
Philistines'
garrison,
that
is
on
the
other
side.
But
he
told
not
his
father.
014:002
And
Saul
tarried
in
the
uttermost
part
of
Gibeah
under
a
pomegranate
tree
which
is
in
Migron:
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
were
about
six
hundred
men;
014:003
And
Ahiah,
the
son
of
Ahitub,
Ichabod's
brother,
the
son
of
Phinehas,
the
son
of
Eli,
the
LORD's
priest
in
Shiloh,
wearing
an
ephod.
And
the
people
knew
not
that
Jonathan
was
gone.
014:004
And
between
the
passages,
by
which
Jonathan
sought
to
go
over
unto
the
Philistines'
garrison,
there
was
a
sharp
rock
on
the
one
side,
and
a
sharp
rock
on
the
other
side:
and
the
name
of
the
one
was
Bozez,
and
the
name
of
the
other
Seneh.
014:005
The
forefront
of
the
one
was
situate
northward
over
against
Michmash,
and
the
other
southward
over
against
Gibeah.
014:006
And
Jonathan
said
to
the
young
man
that
bare
his
armour,
Come,
and
let
us
go
over
unto
the
garrison
of
these
uncircumcised:
it
may
be
that
the
LORD
will
work
for
us:
for
there
is
no
restraint
to
the
LORD
to
save
by
many
or
by
few.
014:007
And
his
armourbearer
said
unto
him,
Do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart:
turn
thee;
behold,
I
am
with
thee
according
to
thy
heart.
014:008
Then
said
Jonathan,
Behold,
we
will
pass
over
unto
these
men,
and
we
will
discover
ourselves
unto
them.
014:009
If
they
say
thus
unto
us,
Tarry
until
we
come
to
you;
then
we
will
stand
still
in
our
place,
and
will
not
go
up
unto
them.
014:010
But
if
they
say
thus,
Come
up
unto
us;
then
we
will
go
up:
for
the
LORD
hath
delivered
them
into
our
hand:
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
us.
014:011
And
both
of
them
discovered
themselves
unto
the
garrison
of
the
Philistines:
and
the
Philistines
said,
Behold,
the
Hebrews
come
forth
out
of
the
holes
where
they
had
hid
themselves.
014:012
And
the
men
of
the
garrison
answered
Jonathan
and
his
armourbearer,
and
said,
Come
up
to
us,
and
we
will
shew
you
a
thing.
And
Jonathan
said
unto
his
armourbearer,
Come
up
after
me:
for
the
LORD
hath
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
Israel.
014:013
And
Jonathan
climbed
up
upon
his
hands
and
upon
his
feet,
and
his
armourbearer
after
him:
and
they
fell
before
Jonathan;
and
his
armourbearer
slew
after
him.
014:014
And
that
first
slaughter,
which
Jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
made,
was
about
twenty
men,
within
as
it
were
an
half
acre
of
land,
which
a
yoke
of
oxen
might
plow.
014:015
And
there
was
trembling
in
the
host,
in
the
field,
and
among
all
the
people:
the
garrison,
and
the
spoilers,
they
also
trembled,
and
the
earth
quaked:
so
it
was
a
very
great
trembling.
014:016
And
the
watchmen
of
Saul
in
Gibeah
of
Benjamin
looked;
and,
behold,
the
multitude
melted
away,
and
they
went
on
beating
down
one
another.
014:017
Then
said
Saul
unto
the
people
that
were
with
him,
Number
now,
and
see
who
is
gone
from
us.
And
when
they
had
numbered,
behold,
Jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
were
not
there.
014:018
And
Saul
said
unto
Ahiah,
Bring
hither
the
ark
of
God.
For
the
ark
of
God
was
at
that
time
with
the
children
of
Israel.
014:019
And
it
came
to
pass,
while
Saul
talked
unto
the
priest,
that
the
noise
that
was
in
the
host
of
the
Philistines
went
on
and
increased:
and
Saul
said
unto
the
priest,
Withdraw
thine
hand.
014:020
And
Saul
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
assembled
themselves,
and
they
came
to
the
battle:
and,
behold,
every
man's
sword
was
against
his
fellow,
and
there
was
a
very
great
discomfiture.
014:021
Moreover
the
Hebrews
that
were
with
the
Philistines
before
that
time,
which
went
up
with
them
into
the
camp
from
the
country
round
about,
even
they
also
turned
to
be
with
the
Israelites
that
were
with
Saul
and
Jonathan.
014:022
Likewise
all
the
men
of
Israel
which
had
hid
themselves
in
mount
Ephraim,
when
they
heard
that
the
Philistines
fled,
even
they
also
followed
hard
after
them
in
the
battle.
014:023
So
the
LORD
saved
Israel
that
day:
and
the
battle
passed
over
unto
Bethaven.
014:024
And
the
men
of
Israel
were
distressed
that
day:
for
Saul
had
adjured
the
people,
saying,
Cursed
be
the
man
that
eateth
any
food
until
evening,
that
I
may
be
avenged
on
mine
enemies.
So
none
of
the
people
tasted
any
food.
014:025
And
all
they
of
the
land
came
to
a
wood;
and
there
was
honey
upon
the
ground.
014:026
And
when
the
people
were
come
into
the
wood,
behold,
the
honey
dropped;
but
no
man
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth:
for
the
people
feared
the
oath.
014:027
But
Jonathan
heard
not
when
his
father
charged
the
people
with
the
oath:
wherefore
he
put
forth
the
end
of
the
rod
that
was
in
his
hand,
and
dipped
it
in
an
honeycomb,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth;
and
his
eyes
were
enlightened.
014:028
Then
answered
one
of
the
people,
and
said,
Thy
father
straitly
charged
the
people
with
an
oath,
saying,
Cursed
be
the
man
that
eateth
any
food
this
day.
And
the
people
were
faint.
014:029
Then
said
Jonathan,
My
father
hath
troubled
the
land:
see,
I
pray
you,
how
mine
eyes
have
been
enlightened,
because
I
tasted
a
little
of
this
honey.
014:030
How
much
more,
if
haply
the
people
had
eaten
freely
to
day
of
the
spoil
of
their
enemies
which
they
found?
for
had
there
not
been
now
a
much
greater
slaughter
among
the
Philistines?
014:031
And
they
smote
the
Philistines
that
day
from
Michmash
to
Aijalon:
and
the
people
were
very
faint.
014:032
And
the
people
flew
upon
the
spoil,
and
took
sheep,
and
oxen,
and
calves,
and
slew
them
on
the
ground:
and
the
people
did
eat
them
with
the
blood.
014:033
Then
they
told
Saul,
saying,
Behold,
the
people
sin
against
the
LORD,
in
that
they
eat
with
the
blood.
And
he
said,
Ye
have
transgressed:
roll
a
great
stone
unto
me
this
day.
014:034
And
Saul
said,
Disperse
yourselves
among
the
people,
and
say
unto
them,
Bring
me
hither
every
man
his
ox,
and
every
man
his
sheep,
and
slay
them
here,
and
eat;
and
sin
not
against
the
LORD
in
eating
with
the
blood.
And
all
the
people
brought
every
man
his
ox
with
him
that
night,
and
slew
them
there.
014:035
And
Saul
built
an
altar
unto
the
LORD:
the
same
was
the
first
altar
that
he
built
unto
the
LORD.
014:036
And
Saul
said,
Let
us
go
down
after
the
Philistines
by
night,
and
spoil
them
until
the
morning
light,
and
let
us
not
leave
a
man
of
them.
And
they
said,
Do
whatsoever
seemeth
good
unto
thee.
Then
said
the
priest,
Let
us
draw
near
hither
unto
God.
014:037
And
Saul
asked
counsel
of
God,
Shall
I
go
down
after
the
Philistines?
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
Israel?
But
he
answered
him
not
that
day.
014:038
And
Saul
said,
Draw
ye
near
hither,
all
the
chief
of
the
people:
and
know
and
see
wherein
this
sin
hath
been
this
day.
014:039
For,
as
the
LORD
liveth,
which
saveth
Israel,
though
it
be
in
Jonathan
my
son,
he
shall
surely
die.
But
there
was
not
a
man
among
all
the
people
that
answered
him.
014:040
Then
said
he
unto
all
Israel,
Be
ye
on
one
side,
and
I
and
Jonathan
my
son
will
be
on
the
other
side.
And
the
people
said
unto
Saul,
Do
what
seemeth
good
unto
thee.
014:041
Therefore
Saul
said
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Give
a
perfect
lot.
And
Saul
and
Jonathan
were
taken:
but
the
people
escaped.
014:042
And
Saul
said,
Cast
lots
between
me
and
Jonathan
my
son.
And
Jonathan
was
taken.
014:043
Then
Saul
said
to
Jonathan,
Tell
me
what
thou
hast
done.
And
Jonathan
told
him,
and
said,
I
did
but
taste
a
little
honey
with
the
end
of
the
rod
that
was
in
mine
hand,
and,
lo,
I
must
die.
014:044
And
Saul
answered,
God
do
so
and
more
also:
for
thou
shalt
surely
die,
Jonathan.
014:045
And
the
people
said
unto
Saul,
Shall
Jonathan
die,
who
hath
wrought
this
great
salvation
in
Israel?
God
forbid:
as
the
LORD
liveth,
there
shall
not
one
hair
of
his
head
fall
to
the
ground;
for
he
hath
wrought
with
God
this
day.
So
the
people
rescued
Jonathan,
that
he
died
not.
014:046
Then
Saul
went
up
from
following
the
Philistines:
and
the
Philistines
went
to
their
own
place.
014:047
So
Saul
took
the
kingdom
over
Israel,
and
fought
against
all
his
enemies
on
every
side,
against
Moab,
and
against
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
against
Edom,
and
against
the
kings
of
Zobah,
and
against
the
Philistines:
and
whithersoever
he
turned
himself,
he
vexed
them.
014:048
And
he
gathered
an
host,
and
smote
the
Amalekites,
and
delivered
Israel
out
of
the
hands
of
them
that
spoiled
them.
014:049
Now
the
sons
of
Saul
were
Jonathan,
and
Ishui,
and
Melchishua:
and
the
names
of
his
two
daughters
were
these;
the
name
of
the
firstborn
Merab,
and
the
name
of
the
younger
Michal:
014:050
And
the
name
of
Saul's
wife
was
Ahinoam,
the
daughter
of
Ahimaaz:
and
the
name
of
the
captain
of
his
host
was
Abner,
the
son
of
Ner,
Saul's
uncle.
014:051
And
Kish
was
the
father
of
Saul;
and
Ner
the
father
of
Abner
was
the
son
of
Abiel.
014:052
And
there
was
sore
war
against
the
Philistines
all
the
days
of
Saul:
and
when
Saul
saw
any
strong
man,
or
any
valiant
man,
he
took
him
unto
him.
015:001
Samuel
also
said
unto
Saul,
The
LORD
sent
me
to
anoint
thee
to
be
king
over
his
people,
over
Israel:
now
therefore
hearken
thou
unto
the
voice
of
the
words
of
the
LORD.
015:002
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
I
remember
that
which
Amalek
did
to
Israel,
how
he
laid
wait
for
him
in
the
way,
when
he
came
up
from
Egypt.
015:003
Now
go
and
smite
Amalek,
and
utterly
destroy
all
that
they
have,
and
spare
them
not;
but
slay
both
man
and
woman,
infant
and
suckling,
ox
and
sheep,
camel
and
ass.
015:004
And
Saul
gathered
the
people
together,
and
numbered
them
in
Telaim,
two
hundred
thousand
footmen,
and
ten
thousand
men
of
Judah.
015:005
And
Saul
came
to
a
city
of
Amalek,
and
laid
wait
in
the
valley.
015:006
And
Saul
said
unto
the
Kenites,
Go,
depart,
get
you
down
from
among
the
Amalekites,
lest
I
destroy
you
with
them:
for
ye
shewed
kindness
to
all
the
children
of
Israel,
when
they
came
up
out
of
Egypt.
So
the
Kenites
departed
from
among
the
Amalekites.
015:007
And
Saul
smote
the
Amalekites
from
Havilah
until
thou
comest
to
Shur,
that
is
over
against
Egypt.
015:008
And
he
took
Agag
the
king
of
the
Amalekites
alive,
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
people
with
the
edge
of
the
sword.
015:009
But
Saul
and
the
people
spared
Agag,
and
the
best
of
the
sheep,
and
of
the
oxen,
and
of
the
fatlings,
and
the
lambs,
and
all
that
was
good,
and
would
not
utterly
destroy
them:
but
every
thing
that
was
vile
and
refuse,
that
they
destroyed
utterly.
015:010
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Samuel,
saying,
015:011
It
repenteth
me
that
I
have
set
up
Saul
to
be
king:
for
he
is
turned
back
from
following
me,
and
hath
not
performed
my
commandments.
And
it
grieved
Samuel;
and
he
cried
unto
the
LORD
all
night.
015:012
And
when
Samuel
rose
early
to
meet
Saul
in
the
morning,
it
was
told
Samuel,
saying,
Saul
came
to
Carmel,
and,
behold,
he
set
him
up
a
place,
and
is
gone
about,
and
passed
on,
and
gone
down
to
Gilgal.
015:013
And
Samuel
came
to
Saul:
and
Saul
said
unto
him,
Blessed
be
thou
of
the
LORD:
I
have
performed
the
commandment
of
the
LORD.
015:014
And
Samuel
said,
What
meaneth
then
this
bleating
of
the
sheep
in
mine
ears,
and
the
lowing
of
the
oxen
which
I
hear?
015:015
And
Saul
said,
They
have
brought
them
from
the
Amalekites:
for
the
people
spared
the
best
of
the
sheep
and
of
the
oxen,
to
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
thy
God;
and
the
rest
we
have
utterly
destroyed.
015:016
Then
Samuel
said
unto
Saul,
Stay,
and
I
will
tell
thee
what
the
LORD
hath
said
to
me
this
night.
And
he
said
unto
him,
Say
on.
015:017
And
Samuel
said,
When
thou
wast
little
in
thine
own
sight,
wast
thou
not
made
the
head
of
the
tribes
of
Israel,
and
the
LORD
anointed
thee
king
over
Israel?
015:018
And
the
LORD
sent
thee
on
a
journey,
and
said,
Go
and
utterly
destroy
the
sinners
the
Amalekites,
and
fight
against
them
until
they
be
consumed.
015:019
Wherefore
then
didst
thou
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD,
but
didst
fly
upon
the
spoil,
and
didst
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD?
015:020
And
Saul
said
unto
Samuel,
Yea,
I
have
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
LORD,
and
have
gone
the
way
which
the
LORD
sent
me,
and
have
brought
Agag
the
king
of
Amalek,
and
have
utterly
destroyed
the
Amalekites.
015:021
But
the
people
took
of
the
spoil,
sheep
and
oxen,
the
chief
of
the
things
which
should
have
been
utterly
destroyed,
to
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
thy
God
in
Gilgal.
015:022
And
Samuel
said,
Hath
the
LORD
as
great
delight
in
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices,
as
in
obeying
the
voice
of
the
LORD?
Behold,
to
obey
is
better
than
sacrifice,
and
to
hearken
than
the
fat
of
rams.
015:023
For
rebellion
is
as
the
sin
of
witchcraft,
and
stubbornness
is
as
iniquity
and
idolatry.
Because
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
LORD,
he
hath
also
rejected
thee
from
being
king.
015:024
And
Saul
said
unto
Samuel,
I
have
sinned:
for
I
have
transgressed
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
and
thy
words:
because
I
feared
the
people,
and
obeyed
their
voice.
015:025
Now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
pardon
my
sin,
and
turn
again
with
me,
that
I
may
worship
the
LORD.
015:026
And
Samuel
said
unto
Saul,
I
will
not
return
with
thee:
for
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
LORD,
and
the
LORD
hath
rejected
thee
from
being
king
over
Israel.
015:027
And
as
Samuel
turned
about
to
go
away,
he
laid
hold
upon
the
skirt
of
his
mantle,
and
it
rent.
015:028
And
Samuel
said
unto
him,
The
LORD
hath
rent
the
kingdom
of
Israel
from
thee
this
day,
and
hath
given
it
to
a
neighbour
of
thine,
that
is
better
than
thou.
015:029
And
also
the
Strength
of
Israel
will
not
lie
nor
repent:
for
he
is
not
a
man,
that
he
should
repent.
015:030
Then
he
said,
I
have
sinned:
yet
honour
me
now,
I
pray
thee,
before
the
elders
of
my
people,
and
before
Israel,
and
turn
again
with
me,
that
I
may
worship
the
LORD
thy
God.
015:031
So
Samuel
turned
again
after
Saul;
and
Saul
worshipped
the
LORD.
015:032
Then
said
Samuel,
Bring
ye
hither
to
me
Agag
the
king
of
the
Amalekites.
And
Agag
came
unto
him
delicately.
And
Agag
said,
Surely
the
bitterness
of
death
is
past.
015:033
And
Samuel
said,
As
the
sword
hath
made
women
childless,
so
shall
thy
mother
be
childless
among
women.
And
Samuel
hewed
Agag
in
pieces
before
the
LORD
in
Gilgal.
015:034
Then
Samuel
went
to
Ramah;
and
Saul
went
up
to
his
house
to
Gibeah
of
Saul.
015:035
And
Samuel
came
no
more
to
see
Saul
until
the
day
of
his
death:
nevertheless
Samuel
mourned
for
Saul:
and
the
LORD
repented
that
he
had
made
Saul
king
over
Israel.
016:001
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Samuel,
How
long
wilt
thou
mourn
for
Saul,
seeing
I
have
rejected
him
from
reigning
over
Israel?
fill
thine
horn
with
oil,
and
go,
I
will
send
thee
to
Jesse
the
Bethlehemite:
for
I
have
provided
me
a
king
among
his
sons.
016:002
And
Samuel
said,
How
can
I
go?
if
Saul
hear
it,
he
will
kill
me.
And
the
LORD
said,
Take
an
heifer
with
thee,
and
say,
I
am
come
to
sacrifice
to
the
LORD.
016:003
And
call
Jesse
to
the
sacrifice,
and
I
will
shew
thee
what
thou
shalt
do:
and
thou
shalt
anoint
unto
me
him
whom
I
name
unto
thee.
016:004
And
Samuel
did
that
which
the
LORD
spake,
and
came
to
Bethlehem.
And
the
elders
of
the
town
trembled
at
his
coming,
and
said,
Comest
thou
peaceably?
016:005
And
he
said,
Peaceably:
I
am
come
to
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD:
sanctify
yourselves,
and
come
with
me
to
the
sacrifice.
And
he
sanctified
Jesse
and
his
sons,
and
called
them
to
the
sacrifice.
016:006
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
were
come,
that
he
looked
on
Eliab,
and
said,
Surely
the
LORD's
anointed
is
before
him.
016:007
But
the
LORD
said
unto
Samuel,
Look
not
on
his
countenance,
or
on
the
height
of
his
stature;
because
I
have
refused
him:
for
the
LORD
seeth
not
as
man
seeth;
for
man
looketh
on
the
outward
appearance,
but
the
LORD
looketh
on
the
heart.
016:008
Then
Jesse
called
Abinadab,
and
made
him
pass
before
Samuel.
And
he
said,
Neither
hath
the
LORD
chosen
this.
016:009
Then
Jesse
made
Shammah
to
pass
by.
And
he
said,
Neither
hath
the
LORD
chosen
this.
016:010
Again,
Jesse
made
seven
of
his
sons
to
pass
before
Samuel.
And
Samuel
said
unto
Jesse,
The
LORD
hath
not
chosen
these.
016:011
And
Samuel
said
unto
Jesse,
Are
here
all
thy
children?
And
he
said,
There
remaineth
yet
the
youngest,
and,
behold,
he
keepeth
the
