sheep.
And
Samuel
said
unto
Jesse,
Send
and
fetch
him:
for
we
will
not
sit
down
till
he
come
hither.
016:012
And
he
sent,
and
brought
him
in.
Now
he
was
ruddy,
and
withal
of
a
beautiful
countenance,
and
goodly
to
look
to.
And
the
LORD
said,
Arise,
anoint
him:
for
this
is
he.
016:013
Then
Samuel
took
the
horn
of
oil,
and
anointed
him
in
the
midst
of
his
brethren:
and
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
David
from
that
day
forward.
So
Samuel
rose
up,
and
went
to
Ramah.
016:014
But
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
departed
from
Saul,
and
an
evil
spirit
from
the
LORD
troubled
him.
016:015
And
Saul's
servants
said
unto
him,
Behold
now,
an
evil
spirit
from
God
troubleth
thee.
016:016
Let
our
lord
now
command
thy
servants,
which
are
before
thee,
to
seek
out
a
man,
who
is
a
cunning
player
on
an
harp:
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
the
evil
spirit
from
God
is
upon
thee,
that
he
shall
play
with
his
hand,
and
thou
shalt
be
well.
016:017
And
Saul
said
unto
his
servants,
Provide
me
now
a
man
that
can
play
well,
and
bring
him
to
me.
016:018
Then
answered
one
of
the
servants,
and
said,
Behold,
I
have
seen
a
son
of
Jesse
the
Bethlehemite,
that
is
cunning
in
playing,
and
a
mighty
valiant
man,
and
a
man
of
war,
and
prudent
in
matters,
and
a
comely
person,
and
the
LORD
is
with
him.
016:019
Wherefore
Saul
sent
messengers
unto
Jesse,
and
said,
Send
me
David
thy
son,
which
is
with
the
sheep.
016:020
And
Jesse
took
an
ass
laden
with
bread,
and
a
bottle
of
wine,
and
a
kid,
and
sent
them
by
David
his
son
unto
Saul.
016:021
And
David
came
to
Saul,
and
stood
before
him:
and
he
loved
him
greatly;
and
he
became
his
armourbearer.
016:022
And
Saul
sent
to
Jesse,
saying,
Let
David,
I
pray
thee,
stand
before
me;
for
he
hath
found
favour
in
my
sight.
016:023
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
evil
spirit
from
God
was
upon
Saul,
that
David
took
an
harp,
and
played
with
his
hand:
so
Saul
was
refreshed,
and
was
well,
and
the
evil
spirit
departed
from
him.
017:001
Now
the
Philistines
gathered
together
their
armies
to
battle,
and
were
gathered
together
at
Shochoh,
which
belongeth
to
Judah,
and
pitched
between
Shochoh
and
Azekah,
in
Ephesdammim.
017:002
And
Saul
and
the
men
of
Israel
were
gathered
together,
and
pitched
by
the
valley
of
Elah,
and
set
the
battle
in
array
against
the
Philistines.
017:003
And
the
Philistines
stood
on
a
mountain
on
the
one
side,
and
Israel
stood
on
a
mountain
on
the
other
side:
and
there
was
a
valley
between
them.
017:004
And
there
went
out
a
champion
out
of
the
camp
of
the
Philistines,
named
Goliath,
of
Gath,
whose
height
was
six
cubits
and
a
span.
017:005
And
he
had
an
helmet
of
brass
upon
his
head,
and
he
was
armed
with
a
coat
of
mail;
and
the
weight
of
the
coat
was
five
thousand
shekels
of
brass.
017:006
And
he
had
greaves
of
brass
upon
his
legs,
and
a
target
of
brass
between
his
shoulders.
017:007
And
the
staff
of
his
spear
was
like
a
weaver's
beam;
and
his
spear's
head
weighed
six
hundred
shekels
of
iron:
and
one
bearing
a
shield
went
before
him.
017:008
And
he
stood
and
cried
unto
the
armies
of
Israel,
and
said
unto
them,
Why
are
ye
come
out
to
set
your
battle
in
array?
am
not
I
a
Philistine,
and
ye
servants
to
Saul?
choose
you
a
man
for
you,
and
let
him
come
down
to
me.
017:009
If
he
be
able
to
fight
with
me,
and
to
kill
me,
then
will
we
be
your
servants:
but
if
I
prevail
against
him,
and
kill
him,
then
shall
ye
be
our
servants,
and
serve
us.
017:010
And
the
Philistine
said,
I
defy
the
armies
of
Israel
this
day;
give
me
a
man,
that
we
may
fight
together.
017:011
When
Saul
and
all
Israel
heard
those
words
of
the
Philistine,
they
were
dismayed,
and
greatly
afraid.
017:012
Now
David
was
the
son
of
that
Ephrathite
of
Bethlehemjudah,
whose
name
was
Jesse;
and
he
had
eight
sons:
and
the
man
went
among
men
for
an
old
man
in
the
days
of
Saul.
017:013
And
the
three
eldest
sons
of
Jesse
went
and
followed
Saul
to
the
battle:
and
the
names
of
his
three
sons
that
went
to
the
battle
were
Eliab
the
firstborn,
and
next
unto
him
Abinadab,
and
the
third
Shammah.
017:014
And
David
was
the
youngest:
and
the
three
eldest
followed
Saul.
017:015
But
David
went
and
returned
from
Saul
to
feed
his
father's
sheep
at
Bethlehem.
017:016
And
the
Philistine
drew
near
morning
and
evening,
and
presented
himself
forty
days.
017:017
And
Jesse
said
unto
David
his
son,
Take
now
for
thy
brethren
an
ephah
of
this
parched
corn,
and
these
ten
loaves,
and
run
to
the
camp
of
thy
brethren;
017:018
And
carry
these
ten
cheeses
unto
the
captain
of
their
thousand,
and
look
how
thy
brethren
fare,
and
take
their
pledge.
017:019
Now
Saul,
and
they,
and
all
the
men
of
Israel,
were
in
the
valley
of
Elah,
fighting
with
the
Philistines.
017:020
And
David
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
left
the
sheep
with
a
keeper,
and
took,
and
went,
as
Jesse
had
commanded
him;
and
he
came
to
the
trench,
as
the
host
was
going
forth
to
the
fight,
and
shouted
for
the
battle.
017:021
For
Israel
and
the
Philistines
had
put
the
battle
in
array,
army
against
army.
017:022
And
David
left
his
carriage
in
the
hand
of
the
keeper
of
the
carriage,
and
ran
into
the
army,
and
came
and
saluted
his
brethren.
017:023
And
as
he
talked
with
them,
behold,
there
came
up
the
champion,
the
Philistine
of
Gath,
Goliath
by
name,
out
of
the
armies
of
the
Philistines,
and
spake
according
to
the
same
words:
and
David
heard
them.
017:024
And
all
the
men
of
Israel,
when
they
saw
the
man,
fled
from
him,
and
were
sore
afraid.
017:025
And
the
men
of
Israel
said,
Have
ye
seen
this
man
that
is
come
up?
surely
to
defy
Israel
is
he
come
up:
and
it
shall
be,
that
the
man
who
killeth
him,
the
king
will
enrich
him
with
great
riches,
and
will
give
him
his
daughter,
and
make
his
father's
house
free
in
Israel.
017:026
And
David
spake
to
the
men
that
stood
by
him,
saying,
What
shall
be
done
to
the
man
that
killeth
this
Philistine,
and
taketh
away
the
reproach
from
Israel?
for
who
is
this
uncircumcised
Philistine,
that
he
should
defy
the
armies
of
the
living
God?
017:027
And
the
people
answered
him
after
this
manner,
saying,
So
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
that
killeth
him.
017:028
And
Eliab
his
eldest
brother
heard
when
he
spake
unto
the
men;
and
Eliab's
anger
was
kindled
against
David,
and
he
said,
Why
camest
thou
down
hither?
and
with
whom
hast
thou
left
those
few
sheep
in
the
wilderness?
I
know
thy
pride,
and
the
naughtiness
of
thine
heart;
for
thou
art
come
down
that
thou
mightest
see
the
battle.
017:029
And
David
said,
What
have
I
now
done?
Is
there
not
a
cause?
017:030
And
he
turned
from
him
toward
another,
and
spake
after
the
same
manner:
and
the
people
answered
him
again
after
the
former
manner.
017:031
And
when
the
words
were
heard
which
David
spake,
they
rehearsed
them
before
Saul:
and
he
sent
for
him.
017:032
And
David
said
to
Saul,
Let
no
man's
heart
fail
because
of
him;
thy
servant
will
go
and
fight
with
this
Philistine.
017:033
And
Saul
said
to
David,
Thou
art
not
able
to
go
against
this
Philistine
to
fight
with
him:
for
thou
art
but
a
youth,
and
he
a
man
of
war
from
his
youth.
017:034
And
David
said
unto
Saul,
Thy
servant
kept
his
father's
sheep,
and
there
came
a
lion,
and
a
bear,
and
took
a
lamb
out
of
the
flock:
017:035
And
I
went
out
after
him,
and
smote
him,
and
delivered
it
out
of
his
mouth:
and
when
he
arose
against
me,
I
caught
him
by
his
beard,
and
smote
him,
and
slew
him.
017:036
Thy
servant
slew
both
the
lion
and
the
bear:
and
this
uncircumcised
Philistine
shall
be
as
one
of
them,
seeing
he
hath
defied
the
armies
of
the
living
God.
017:037
David
said
moreover,
The
LORD
that
delivered
me
out
of
the
paw
of
the
lion,
and
out
of
the
paw
of
the
bear,
he
will
deliver
me
out
of
the
hand
of
this
Philistine.
And
Saul
said
unto
David,
Go,
and
the
LORD
be
with
thee.
017:038
And
Saul
armed
David
with
his
armour,
and
he
put
an
helmet
of
brass
upon
his
head;
also
he
armed
him
with
a
coat
of
mail.
017:039
And
David
girded
his
sword
upon
his
armour,
and
he
assayed
to
go;
for
he
had
not
proved
it.
And
David
said
unto
Saul,
I
cannot
go
with
these;
for
I
have
not
proved
them.
And
David
put
them
off
him.
017:040
And
he
took
his
staff
in
his
hand,
and
chose
him
five
smooth
stones
out
of
the
brook,
and
put
them
in
a
shepherd's
bag
which
he
had,
even
in
a
scrip;
and
his
sling
was
in
his
hand:
and
he
drew
near
to
the
Philistine.
017:041
And
the
Philistine
came
on
and
drew
near
unto
David;
and
the
man
that
bare
the
shield
went
before
him.
017:042
And
when
the
Philistine
looked
about,
and
saw
David,
he
disdained
him:
for
he
was
but
a
youth,
and
ruddy,
and
of
a
fair
countenance.
017:043
And
the
Philistine
said
unto
David,
Am
I
a
dog,
that
thou
comest
to
me
with
staves?
And
the
Philistine
cursed
David
by
his
gods.
017:044
And
the
Philistine
said
to
David,
Come
to
me,
and
I
will
give
thy
flesh
unto
the
fowls
of
the
air,
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
field.
017:045
Then
said
David
to
the
Philistine,
Thou
comest
to
me
with
a
sword,
and
with
a
spear,
and
with
a
shield:
but
I
come
to
thee
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
the
God
of
the
armies
of
Israel,
whom
thou
hast
defied.
017:046
This
day
will
the
LORD
deliver
thee
into
mine
hand;
and
I
will
smite
thee,
and
take
thine
head
from
thee;
and
I
will
give
the
carcases
of
the
host
of
the
Philistines
this
day
unto
the
fowls
of
the
air,
and
to
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth;
that
all
the
earth
may
know
that
there
is
a
God
in
Israel.
017:047
And
all
this
assembly
shall
know
that
the
LORD
saveth
not
with
sword
and
spear:
for
the
battle
is
the
LORD's,
and
he
will
give
you
into
our
hands.
017:048
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
Philistine
arose,
and
came,
and
drew
nigh
to
meet
David,
that
David
hastened,
and
ran
toward
the
army
to
meet
the
Philistine.
017:049
And
David
put
his
hand
in
his
bag,
and
took
thence
a
stone,
and
slang
it,
and
smote
the
Philistine
in
his
forehead,
that
the
stone
sunk
into
his
forehead;
and
he
fell
upon
his
face
to
the
earth.
017:050
So
David
prevailed
over
the
Philistine
with
a
sling
and
with
a
stone,
and
smote
the
Philistine,
and
slew
him;
but
there
was
no
sword
in
the
hand
of
David.
017:051
Therefore
David
ran,
and
stood
upon
the
Philistine,
and
took
his
sword,
and
drew
it
out
of
the
sheath
thereof,
and
slew
him,
and
cut
off
his
head
therewith.
And
when
the
Philistines
saw
their
champion
was
dead,
they
fled.
017:052
And
the
men
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
arose,
and
shouted,
and
pursued
the
Philistines,
until
thou
come
to
the
valley,
and
to
the
gates
of
Ekron.
And
the
wounded
of
the
Philistines
fell
down
by
the
way
to
Shaaraim,
even
unto
Gath,
and
unto
Ekron.
017:053
And
the
children
of
Israel
returned
from
chasing
after
the
Philistines,
and
they
spoiled
their
tents.
017:054
And
David
took
the
head
of
the
Philistine,
and
brought
it
to
Jerusalem;
but
he
put
his
armour
in
his
tent.
017:055
And
when
Saul
saw
David
go
forth
against
the
Philistine,
he
said
unto
Abner,
the
captain
of
the
host,
Abner,
whose
son
is
this
youth?
And
Abner
said,
As
thy
soul
liveth,
O
king,
I
cannot
tell.
017:056
And
the
king
said,
Enquire
thou
whose
son
the
stripling
is.
017:057
And
as
David
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
Philistine,
Abner
took
him,
and
brought
him
before
Saul
with
the
head
of
the
Philistine
in
his
hand.
017:058
And
Saul
said
to
him,
Whose
son
art
thou,
thou
young
man?
And
David
answered,
I
am
the
son
of
thy
servant
Jesse
the
Bethlehemite.
018:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
Saul,
that
the
soul
of
Jonathan
was
knit
with
the
soul
of
David,
and
Jonathan
loved
him
as
his
own
soul.
018:002
And
Saul
took
him
that
day,
and
would
let
him
go
no
more
home
to
his
father's
house.
018:003
Then
Jonathan
and
David
made
a
covenant,
because
he
loved
him
as
his
own
soul.
018:004
And
Jonathan
stripped
himself
of
the
robe
that
was
upon
him,
and
gave
it
to
David,
and
his
garments,
even
to
his
sword,
and
to
his
bow,
and
to
his
girdle.
018:005
And
David
went
out
whithersoever
Saul
sent
him,
and
behaved
himself
wisely:
and
Saul
set
him
over
the
men
of
war,
and
he
was
accepted
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people,
and
also
in
the
sight
of
Saul's
servants.
018:006
And
it
came
to
pass
as
they
came,
when
David
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
Philistine,
that
the
women
came
out
of
all
cities
of
Israel,
singing
and
dancing,
to
meet
king
Saul,
with
tabrets,
with
joy,
and
with
instruments
of
musick.
018:007
And
the
women
answered
one
another
as
they
played,
and
said,
Saul
hath
slain
his
thousands,
and
David
his
ten
thousands.
018:008
And
Saul
was
very
wroth,
and
the
saying
displeased
him;
and
he
said,
They
have
ascribed
unto
David
ten
thousands,
and
to
me
they
have
ascribed
but
thousands:
and
what
can
he
have
more
but
the
kingdom?
018:009
And
Saul
eyed
David
from
that
day
and
forward.
018:010
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
the
evil
spirit
from
God
came
upon
Saul,
and
he
prophesied
in
the
midst
of
the
house:
and
David
played
with
his
hand,
as
at
other
times:
and
there
was
a
javelin
in
Saul's
hand.
018:011
And
Saul
cast
the
javelin;
for
he
said,
I
will
smite
David
even
to
the
wall
with
it.
And
David
avoided
out
of
his
presence
twice.
018:012
And
Saul
was
afraid
of
David,
because
the
LORD
was
with
him,
and
was
departed
from
Saul.
018:013
Therefore
Saul
removed
him
from
him,
and
made
him
his
captain
over
a
thousand;
and
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
the
people.
018:014
And
David
behaved
himself
wisely
in
all
his
ways;
and
the
LORD
was
with
him.
018:015
Wherefore
when
Saul
saw
that
he
behaved
himself
very
wisely,
he
was
afraid
of
him.
018:016
But
all
Israel
and
Judah
loved
David,
because
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
them.
018:017
And
Saul
said
to
David,
Behold
my
elder
daughter
Merab,
her
will
I
give
thee
to
wife:
only
be
thou
valiant
for
me,
and
fight
the
LORD's
battles.
For
Saul
said,
Let
not
mine
hand
be
upon
him,
but
let
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
be
upon
him.
018:018
And
David
said
unto
Saul,
Who
am
I?
and
what
is
my
life,
or
my
father's
family
in
Israel,
that
I
should
be
son
in
law
to
the
king?
018:019
But
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
when
Merab
Saul's
daughter
should
have
been
given
to
David,
that
she
was
given
unto
Adriel
the
Meholathite
to
wife.
018:020
And
Michal
Saul's
daughter
loved
David:
and
they
told
Saul,
and
the
thing
pleased
him.
018:021
And
Saul
said,
I
will
give
him
her,
that
she
may
be
a
snare
to
him,
and
that
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
may
be
against
him.
Wherefore
Saul
said
to
David,
Thou
shalt
this
day
be
my
son
in
law
in
the
one
of
the
twain.
018:022
And
Saul
commanded
his
servants,
saying,
Commune
with
David
secretly,
and
say,
Behold,
the
king
hath
delight
in
thee,
and
all
his
servants
love
thee:
now
therefore
be
the
king's
son
in
law.
018:023
And
Saul's
servants
spake
those
words
in
the
ears
of
David.
And
David
said,
Seemeth
it
to
you
a
light
thing
to
be
a
king's
son
in
law,
seeing
that
I
am
a
poor
man,
and
lightly
esteemed?
018:024
And
the
servants
of
Saul
told
him,
saying,
On
this
manner
spake
David.
018:025
And
Saul
said,
Thus
shall
ye
say
to
David,
The
king
desireth
not
any
dowry,
but
an
hundred
foreskins
of
the
Philistines,
to
be
avenged
of
the
king's
enemies.
But
Saul
thought
to
make
David
fall
by
the
hand
of
the
Philistines.
018:026
And
when
his
servants
told
David
these
words,
it
pleased
David
well
to
be
the
king's
son
in
law:
and
the
days
were
not
expired.
018:027
Wherefore
David
arose
and
went,
he
and
his
men,
and
slew
of
the
Philistines
two
hundred
men;
and
David
brought
their
foreskins,
and
they
gave
them
in
full
tale
to
the
king,
that
he
might
be
the
king's
son
in
law.
And
Saul
gave
him
Michal
his
daughter
to
wife.
018:028
And
Saul
saw
and
knew
that
the
LORD
was
with
David,
and
that
Michal
Saul's
daughter
loved
him.
018:029
And
Saul
was
yet
the
more
afraid
of
David;
and
Saul
became
David's
enemy
continually.
018:030
Then
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
went
forth:
and
it
came
to
pass,
after
they
went
forth,
that
David
behaved
himself
more
wisely
than
all
the
servants
of
Saul;
so
that
his
name
was
much
set
by.
019:001
And
Saul
spake
to
Jonathan
his
son,
and
to
all
his
servants,
that
they
should
kill
David.
019:002
But
Jonathan
Saul's
son
delighted
much
in
David:
and
Jonathan
told
David,
saying,
Saul
my
father
seeketh
to
kill
thee:
now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
take
heed
to
thyself
until
the
morning,
and
abide
in
a
secret
place,
and
hide
thyself:
019:003
And
I
will
go
out
and
stand
beside
my
father
in
the
field
where
thou
art,
and
I
will
commune
with
my
father
of
thee;
and
what
I
see,
that
I
will
tell
thee.
019:004
And
Jonathan
spake
good
of
David
unto
Saul
his
father,
and
said
unto
him,
Let
not
the
king
sin
against
his
servant,
against
David;
because
he
hath
not
sinned
against
thee,
and
because
his
works
have
been
to
thee-ward
very
good:
019:005
For
he
did
put
his
life
in
his
hand,
and
slew
the
Philistine,
and
the
LORD
wrought
a
great
salvation
for
all
Israel:
thou
sawest
it,
and
didst
rejoice:
wherefore
then
wilt
thou
sin
against
innocent
blood,
to
slay
David
without
a
cause?
019:006
And
Saul
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
Jonathan:
and
Saul
sware,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
he
shall
not
be
slain.
019:007
And
Jonathan
called
David,
and
Jonathan
shewed
him
all
those
things.
And
Jonathan
brought
David
to
Saul,
and
he
was
in
his
presence,
as
in
times
past.
019:008
And
there
was
war
again:
and
David
went
out,
and
fought
with
the
Philistines,
and
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter;
and
they
fled
from
him.
019:009
And
the
evil
spirit
from
the
LORD
was
upon
Saul,
as
he
sat
in
his
house
with
his
javelin
in
his
hand:
and
David
played
with
his
hand.
019:010
And
Saul
sought
to
smite
David
even
to
the
wall
with
the
javelin:
but
he
slipped
away
out
of
Saul's
presence,
and
he
smote
the
javelin
into
the
wall:
and
David
fled,
and
escaped
that
night.
019:011
Saul
also
sent
messengers
unto
David's
house,
to
watch
him,
and
to
slay
him
in
the
morning:
and
Michal
David's
wife
told
him,
saying,
If
thou
save
not
thy
life
to
night,
to
morrow
thou
shalt
be
slain.
019:012
So
Michal
let
David
down
through
a
window:
and
he
went,
and
fled,
and
escaped.
019:013
And
Michal
took
an
image,
and
laid
it
in
the
bed,
and
put
a
pillow
of
goats'
hair
for
his
bolster,
and
covered
it
with
a
cloth.
019:014
And
when
Saul
sent
messengers
to
take
David,
she
said,
He
is
sick.
019:015
And
Saul
sent
the
messengers
again
to
see
David,
saying,
Bring
him
up
to
me
in
the
bed,
that
I
may
slay
him.
019:016
And
when
the
messengers
were
come
in,
behold,
there
was
an
image
in
the
bed,
with
a
pillow
of
goats'
hair
for
his
bolster.
019:017
And
Saul
said
unto
Michal,
Why
hast
thou
deceived
me
so,
and
sent
away
mine
enemy,
that
he
is
escaped?
And
Michal
answered
Saul,
He
said
unto
me,
Let
me
go;
why
should
I
kill
thee?
019:018
So
David
fled,
and
escaped,
and
came
to
Samuel
to
Ramah,
and
told
him
all
that
Saul
had
done
to
him.
And
he
and
Samuel
went
and
dwelt
in
Naioth.
019:019
And
it
was
told
Saul,
saying,
Behold,
David
is
at
Naioth
in
Ramah.
019:020
And
Saul
sent
messengers
to
take
David:
and
when
they
saw
the
company
of
the
prophets
prophesying,
and
Samuel
standing
as
appointed
over
them,
the
Spirit
of
God
was
upon
the
messengers
of
Saul,
and
they
also
prophesied.
019:021
And
when
it
was
told
Saul,
he
sent
other
messengers,
and
they
prophesied
likewise.
And
Saul
sent
messengers
again
the
third
time,
and
they
prophesied
also.
019:022
Then
went
he
also
to
Ramah,
and
came
to
a
great
well
that
is
in
Sechu:
and
he
asked
and
said,
Where
are
Samuel
and
David?
And
one
said,
Behold,
they
be
at
Naioth
in
Ramah.
019:023
And
he
went
thither
to
Naioth
in
Ramah:
and
the
Spirit
of
God
was
upon
him
also,
and
he
went
on,
and
prophesied,
until
he
came
to
Naioth
in
Ramah.
019:024
And
he
stripped
off
his
clothes
also,
and
prophesied
before
Samuel
in
like
manner,
and
lay
down
naked
all
that
day
and
all
that
night.
Wherefore
they
say,
Is
Saul
also
among
the
prophets?
020:001
And
David
fled
from
Naioth
in
Ramah,
and
came
and
said
before
Jonathan,
What
have
I
done?
what
is
mine
iniquity?
and
what
is
my
sin
before
thy
father,
that
he
seeketh
my
life?
020:002
And
he
said
unto
him,
God
forbid;
thou
shalt
not
die:
behold,
my
father
will
do
nothing
either
great
or
small,
but
that
he
will
shew
it
me:
and
why
should
my
father
hide
this
thing
from
me?
it
is
not
so.
020:003
And
David
sware
moreover,
and
said,
Thy
father
certainly
knoweth
that
I
have
found
grace
in
thine
eyes;
and
he
saith,
Let
not
Jonathan
know
this,
lest
he
be
grieved:
but
truly
as
the
LORD
liveth,
and
as
thy
soul
liveth,
there
is
but
a
step
between
me
and
death.
020:004
Then
said
Jonathan
unto
David,
Whatsoever
thy
soul
desireth,
I
will
even
do
it
for
thee.
020:005
And
David
said
unto
Jonathan,
Behold,
to
morrow
is
the
new
moon,
and
I
should
not
fail
to
sit
with
the
king
at
meat:
but
let
me
go,
that
I
may
hide
myself
in
the
field
unto
the
third
day
at
even.
020:006
If
thy
father
at
all
miss
me,
then
say,
David
earnestly
asked
leave
of
me
that
he
might
run
to
Bethlehem
his
city:
for
there
is
a
yearly
sacrifice
there
for
all
the
family.
020:007
If
he
say
thus,
It
is
well;
thy
servant
shall
have
peace:
but
if
he
be
very
wroth,
then
be
sure
that
evil
is
determined
by
him.
020:008
Therefore
thou
shalt
deal
kindly
with
thy
servant;
for
thou
hast
brought
thy
servant
into
a
covenant
of
the
LORD
with
thee:
notwithstanding,
if
there
be
in
me
iniquity,
slay
me
thyself;
for
why
shouldest
thou
bring
me
to
thy
father?
020:009
And
Jonathan
said,
Far
be
it
from
thee:
for
if
I
knew
certainly
that
evil
were
determined
by
my
father
to
come
upon
thee,
then
would
not
I
tell
it
thee?
020:010
Then
said
David
to
Jonathan,
Who
shall
tell
me?
or
what
if
thy
father
answer
thee
roughly?
020:011
And
Jonathan
said
unto
