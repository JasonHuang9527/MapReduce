David,
Come,
and
let
us
go
out
into
the
field.
And
they
went
out
both
of
them
into
the
field.
020:012
And
Jonathan
said
unto
David,
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
when
I
have
sounded
my
father
about
to
morrow
any
time,
or
the
third
day,
and,
behold,
if
there
be
good
toward
David,
and
I
then
send
not
unto
thee,
and
shew
it
thee;
020:013
The
LORD
do
so
and
much
more
to
Jonathan:
but
if
it
please
my
father
to
do
thee
evil,
then
I
will
shew
it
thee,
and
send
thee
away,
that
thou
mayest
go
in
peace:
and
the
LORD
be
with
thee,
as
he
hath
been
with
my
father.
020:014
And
thou
shalt
not
only
while
yet
I
live
shew
me
the
kindness
of
the
LORD,
that
I
die
not:
020:015
But
also
thou
shalt
not
cut
off
thy
kindness
from
my
house
for
ever:
no,
not
when
the
LORD
hath
cut
off
the
enemies
of
David
every
one
from
the
face
of
the
earth.
020:016
So
Jonathan
made
a
covenant
with
the
house
of
David,
saying,
Let
the
LORD
even
require
it
at
the
hand
of
David's
enemies.
020:017
And
Jonathan
caused
David
to
swear
again,
because
he
loved
him:
for
he
loved
him
as
he
loved
his
own
soul.
020:018
Then
Jonathan
said
to
David,
To
morrow
is
the
new
moon:
and
thou
shalt
be
missed,
because
thy
seat
will
be
empty.
020:019
And
when
thou
hast
stayed
three
days,
then
thou
shalt
go
down
quickly,
and
come
to
the
place
where
thou
didst
hide
thyself
when
the
business
was
in
hand,
and
shalt
remain
by
the
stone
Ezel.
020:020
And
I
will
shoot
three
arrows
on
the
side
thereof,
as
though
I
shot
at
a
mark.
020:021
And,
behold,
I
will
send
a
lad,
saying,
Go,
find
out
the
arrows.
If
I
expressly
say
unto
the
lad,
Behold,
the
arrows
are
on
this
side
of
thee,
take
them;
then
come
thou:
for
there
is
peace
to
thee,
and
no
hurt;
as
the
LORD
liveth.
020:022
But
if
I
say
thus
unto
the
young
man,
Behold,
the
arrows
are
beyond
thee;
go
thy
way:
for
the
LORD
hath
sent
thee
away.
020:023
And
as
touching
the
matter
which
thou
and
I
have
spoken
of,
behold,
the
LORD
be
between
thee
and
me
for
ever.
020:024
So
David
hid
himself
in
the
field:
and
when
the
new
moon
was
come,
the
king
sat
him
down
to
eat
meat.
020:025
And
the
king
sat
upon
his
seat,
as
at
other
times,
even
upon
a
seat
by
the
wall:
and
Jonathan
arose,
and
Abner
sat
by
Saul's
side,
and
David's
place
was
empty.
020:026
Nevertheless
Saul
spake
not
any
thing
that
day:
for
he
thought,
Something
hath
befallen
him,
he
is
not
clean;
surely
he
is
not
clean.
020:027
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
which
was
the
second
day
of
the
month,
that
David's
place
was
empty:
and
Saul
said
unto
Jonathan
his
son,
Wherefore
cometh
not
the
son
of
Jesse
to
meat,
neither
yesterday,
nor
to
day?
020:028
And
Jonathan
answered
Saul,
David
earnestly
asked
leave
of
me
to
go
to
Bethlehem:
020:029
And
he
said,
Let
me
go,
I
pray
thee;
for
our
family
hath
a
sacrifice
in
the
city;
and
my
brother,
he
hath
commanded
me
to
be
there:
and
now,
if
I
have
found
favour
in
thine
eyes,
let
me
get
away,
I
pray
thee,
and
see
my
brethren.
Therefore
he
cometh
not
unto
the
king's
table.
020:030
Then
Saul's
anger
was
kindled
against
Jonathan,
and
he
said
unto
him,
Thou
son
of
the
perverse
rebellious
woman,
do
not
I
know
that
thou
hast
chosen
the
son
of
Jesse
to
thine
own
confusion,
and
unto
the
confusion
of
thy
mother's
nakedness?
020:031
For
as
long
as
the
son
of
Jesse
liveth
upon
the
ground,
thou
shalt
not
be
established,
nor
thy
kingdom.
Wherefore
now
send
and
fetch
him
unto
me,
for
he
shall
surely
die.
020:032
And
Jonathan
answered
Saul
his
father,
and
said
unto
him,
Wherefore
shall
he
be
slain?
what
hath
he
done?
020:033
And
Saul
cast
a
javelin
at
him
to
smite
him:
whereby
Jonathan
knew
that
it
was
determined
of
his
father
to
slay
David.
020:034
So
Jonathan
arose
from
the
table
in
fierce
anger,
and
did
eat
no
meat
the
second
day
of
the
month:
for
he
was
grieved
for
David,
because
his
father
had
done
him
shame.
020:035
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning,
that
Jonathan
went
out
into
the
field
at
the
time
appointed
with
David,
and
a
little
lad
with
him.
020:036
And
he
said
unto
his
lad,
Run,
find
out
now
the
arrows
which
I
shoot.
And
as
the
lad
ran,
he
shot
an
arrow
beyond
him.
020:037
And
when
the
lad
was
come
to
the
place
of
the
arrow
which
Jonathan
had
shot,
Jonathan
cried
after
the
lad,
and
said,
Is
not
the
arrow
beyond
thee?
020:038
And
Jonathan
cried
after
the
lad,
Make
speed,
haste,
stay
not.
And
Jonathan's
lad
gathered
up
the
arrows,
and
came
to
his
master.
020:039
But
the
lad
knew
not
any
thing:
only
Jonathan
and
David
knew
the
matter.
020:040
And
Jonathan
gave
his
artillery
unto
his
lad,
and
said
unto
him,
Go,
carry
them
to
the
city.
020:041
And
as
soon
as
the
lad
was
gone,
David
arose
out
of
a
place
toward
the
south,
and
fell
on
his
face
to
the
ground,
and
bowed
himself
three
times:
and
they
kissed
one
another,
and
wept
one
with
another,
until
David
exceeded.
020:042
And
Jonathan
said
to
David,
Go
in
peace,
forasmuch
as
we
have
sworn
both
of
us
in
the
name
of
the
LORD,
saying,
The
LORD
be
between
me
and
thee,
and
between
my
seed
and
thy
seed
for
ever.
And
he
arose
and
departed:
and
Jonathan
went
into
the
city.
021:001
Then
came
David
to
Nob
to
Ahimelech
the
priest:
and
Ahimelech
was
afraid
at
the
meeting
of
David,
and
said
unto
him,
Why
art
thou
alone,
and
no
man
with
thee?
021:002
And
David
said
unto
Ahimelech
the
priest,
The
king
hath
commanded
me
a
business,
and
hath
said
unto
me,
Let
no
man
know
any
thing
of
the
business
whereabout
I
send
thee,
and
what
I
have
commanded
thee:
and
I
have
appointed
my
servants
to
such
and
such
a
place.
021:003
Now
therefore
what
is
under
thine
hand?
give
me
five
loaves
of
bread
in
mine
hand,
or
what
there
is
present.
021:004
And
the
priest
answered
David,
and
said,
There
is
no
common
bread
under
mine
hand,
but
there
is
hallowed
bread;
if
the
young
men
have
kept
themselves
at
least
from
women.
021:005
And
David
answered
the
priest,
and
said
unto
him,
Of
a
truth
women
have
been
kept
from
us
about
these
three
days,
since
I
came
out,
and
the
vessels
of
the
young
men
are
holy,
and
the
bread
is
in
a
manner
common,
yea,
though
it
were
sanctified
this
day
in
the
vessel.
021:006
So
the
priest
gave
him
hallowed
bread:
for
there
was
no
bread
there
but
the
shewbread,
that
was
taken
from
before
the
LORD,
to
put
hot
bread
in
the
day
when
it
was
taken
away.
021:007
Now
a
certain
man
of
the
servants
of
Saul
was
there
that
day,
detained
before
the
LORD;
and
his
name
was
Doeg,
an
Edomite,
the
chiefest
of
the
herdmen
that
belonged
to
Saul.
021:008
And
David
said
unto
Ahimelech,
And
is
there
not
here
under
thine
hand
spear
or
sword?
for
I
have
neither
brought
my
sword
nor
my
weapons
with
me,
because
the
king's
business
required
haste.
021:009
And
the
priest
said,
The
sword
of
Goliath
the
Philistine,
whom
thou
slewest
in
the
valley
of
Elah,
behold,
it
is
here
wrapped
in
a
cloth
behind
the
ephod:
if
thou
wilt
take
that,
take
it:
for
there
is
no
other
save
that
here.
And
David
said,
There
is
none
like
that;
give
it
me.
021:010
And
David
arose
and
fled
that
day
for
fear
of
Saul,
and
went
to
Achish
the
king
of
Gath.
021:011
And
the
servants
of
Achish
said
unto
him,
Is
not
this
David
the
king
of
the
land?
did
they
not
sing
one
to
another
of
him
in
dances,
saying,
Saul
hath
slain
his
thousands,
and
David
his
ten
thousands?
021:012
And
David
laid
up
these
words
in
his
heart,
and
was
sore
afraid
of
Achish
the
king
of
Gath.
021:013
And
he
changed
his
behaviour
before
them,
and
feigned
himself
mad
in
their
hands,
and
scrabbled
on
the
doors
of
the
gate,
and
let
his
spittle
fall
down
upon
his
beard.
021:014
Then
said
Achish
unto
his
servants,
Lo,
ye
see
the
man
is
mad:
wherefore
then
have
ye
brought
him
to
me?
021:015
Have
I
need
of
mad
men,
that
ye
have
brought
this
fellow
to
play
the
mad
man
in
my
presence?
shall
this
fellow
come
into
my
house?
022:001
David
therefore
departed
thence,
and
escaped
to
the
cave
Adullam:
and
when
his
brethren
and
all
his
father's
house
heard
it,
they
went
down
thither
to
him.
022:002
And
every
one
that
was
in
distress,
and
every
one
that
was
in
debt,
and
every
one
that
was
discontented,
gathered
themselves
unto
him;
and
he
became
a
captain
over
them:
and
there
were
with
him
about
four
hundred
men.
022:003
And
David
went
thence
to
Mizpeh
of
Moab:
and
he
said
unto
the
king
of
Moab,
Let
my
father
and
my
mother,
I
pray
thee,
come
forth,
and
be
with
you,
till
I
know
what
God
will
do
for
me.
022:004
And
he
brought
them
before
the
king
of
Moab:
and
they
dwelt
with
him
all
the
while
that
David
was
in
the
hold.
022:005
And
the
prophet
Gad
said
unto
David,
Abide
not
in
the
hold;
depart,
and
get
thee
into
the
land
of
Judah.
Then
David
departed,
and
came
into
the
forest
of
Hareth.
022:006
When
Saul
heard
that
David
was
discovered,
and
the
men
that
were
with
him,
(now
Saul
abode
in
Gibeah
under
a
tree
in
Ramah,
having
his
spear
in
his
hand,
and
all
his
servants
were
standing
about
him;)
022:007
Then
Saul
said
unto
his
servants
that
stood
about
him,
Hear
now,
ye
Benjamites;
will
the
son
of
Jesse
give
every
one
of
you
fields
and
vineyards,
and
make
you
all
captains
of
thousands,
and
captains
of
hundreds;
022:008
That
all
of
you
have
conspired
against
me,
and
there
is
none
that
sheweth
me
that
my
son
hath
made
a
league
with
the
son
of
Jesse,
and
there
is
none
of
you
that
is
sorry
for
me,
or
sheweth
unto
me
that
my
son
hath
stirred
up
my
servant
against
me,
to
lie
in
wait,
as
at
this
day?
022:009
Then
answered
Doeg
the
Edomite,
which
was
set
over
the
servants
of
Saul,
and
said,
I
saw
the
son
of
Jesse
coming
to
Nob,
to
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Ahitub.
022:010
And
he
enquired
of
the
LORD
for
him,
and
gave
him
victuals,
and
gave
him
the
sword
of
Goliath
the
Philistine.
022:011
Then
the
king
sent
to
call
Ahimelech
the
priest,
the
son
of
Ahitub,
and
all
his
father's
house,
the
priests
that
were
in
Nob:
and
they
came
all
of
them
to
the
king.
022:012
And
Saul
said,
Hear
now,
thou
son
of
Ahitub.
And
he
answered,
Here
I
am,
my
lord.
022:013
And
Saul
said
unto
him,
Why
have
ye
conspired
against
me,
thou
and
the
son
of
Jesse,
in
that
thou
hast
given
him
bread,
and
a
sword,
and
hast
enquired
of
God
for
him,
that
he
should
rise
against
me,
to
lie
in
wait,
as
at
this
day?
022:014
Then
Ahimelech
answered
the
king,
and
said,
And
who
is
so
faithful
among
all
thy
servants
as
David,
which
is
the
king's
son
in
law,
and
goeth
at
thy
bidding,
and
is
honourable
in
thine
house?
022:015
Did
I
then
begin
to
enquire
of
God
for
him?
be
it
far
from
me:
let
not
the
king
impute
any
thing
unto
his
servant,
nor
to
all
the
house
of
my
father:
for
thy
servant
knew
nothing
of
all
this,
less
or
more.
022:016
And
the
king
said,
Thou
shalt
surely
die,
Ahimelech,
thou,
and
all
thy
father's
house.
022:017
And
the
king
said
unto
the
footmen
that
stood
about
him,
Turn,
and
slay
the
priests
of
the
LORD:
because
their
hand
also
is
with
David,
and
because
they
knew
when
he
fled,
and
did
not
shew
it
to
me.
But
the
servants
of
the
king
would
not
put
forth
their
hand
to
fall
upon
the
priests
of
the
LORD.
022:018
And
the
king
said
to
Doeg,
Turn
thou,
and
fall
upon
the
priests.
And
Doeg
the
Edomite
turned,
and
he
fell
upon
the
priests,
and
slew
on
that
day
fourscore
and
five
persons
that
did
wear
a
linen
ephod.
022:019
And
Nob,
the
city
of
the
priests,
smote
he
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
both
men
and
women,
children
and
sucklings,
and
oxen,
and
asses,
and
sheep,
with
the
edge
of
the
sword.
022:020
And
one
of
the
sons
of
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Ahitub,
named
Abiathar,
escaped,
and
fled
after
David.
022:021
And
Abiathar
shewed
David
that
Saul
had
slain
the
LORD's
priests.
022:022
And
David
said
unto
Abiathar,
I
knew
it
that
day,
when
Doeg
the
Edomite
was
there,
that
he
would
surely
tell
Saul:
I
have
occasioned
the
death
of
all
the
persons
of
thy
father's
house.
022:023
Abide
thou
with
me,
fear
not:
for
he
that
seeketh
my
life
seeketh
thy
life:
but
with
me
thou
shalt
be
in
safeguard.
023:001
Then
they
told
David,
saying,
Behold,
the
Philistines
fight
against
Keilah,
and
they
rob
the
threshingfloors.
023:002
Therefore
David
enquired
of
the
LORD,
saying,
Shall
I
go
and
smite
these
Philistines?
And
the
LORD
said
unto
David,
Go,
and
smite
the
Philistines,
and
save
Keilah.
023:003
And
David's
men
said
unto
him,
Behold,
we
be
afraid
here
in
Judah:
how
much
more
then
if
we
come
to
Keilah
against
the
armies
of
the
Philistines?
023:004
Then
David
enquired
of
the
LORD
yet
again.
And
the
LORD
answered
him
and
said,
Arise,
go
down
to
Keilah;
for
I
will
deliver
the
Philistines
into
thine
hand.
023:005
So
David
and
his
men
went
to
Keilah,
and
fought
with
the
Philistines,
and
brought
away
their
cattle,
and
smote
them
with
a
great
slaughter.
So
David
saved
the
inhabitants
of
Keilah.
023:006
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Abiathar
the
son
of
Ahimelech
fled
to
David
to
Keilah,
that
he
came
down
with
an
ephod
in
his
hand.
023:007
And
it
was
told
Saul
that
David
was
come
to
Keilah.
And
Saul
said,
God
hath
delivered
him
into
mine
hand;
for
he
is
shut
in,
by
entering
into
a
town
that
hath
gates
and
bars.
023:008
And
Saul
called
all
the
people
together
to
war,
to
go
down
to
Keilah,
to
besiege
David
and
his
men.
023:009
And
David
knew
that
Saul
secretly
practised
mischief
against
him;
and
he
said
to
Abiathar
the
priest,
Bring
hither
the
ephod.
023:010
Then
said
David,
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
thy
servant
hath
certainly
heard
that
Saul
seeketh
to
come
to
Keilah,
to
destroy
the
city
for
my
sake.
023:011
Will
the
men
of
Keilah
deliver
me
up
into
his
hand?
will
Saul
come
down,
as
thy
servant
hath
heard?
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
I
beseech
thee,
tell
thy
servant.
And
the
LORD
said,
He
will
come
down.
023:012
Then
said
David,
Will
the
men
of
Keilah
deliver
me
and
my
men
into
the
hand
of
Saul?
And
the
LORD
said,
They
will
deliver
thee
up.
023:013
Then
David
and
his
men,
which
were
about
six
hundred,
arose
and
departed
out
of
Keilah,
and
went
whithersoever
they
could
go.
And
it
was
told
Saul
that
David
was
escaped
from
Keilah;
and
he
forbare
to
go
forth.
023:014
And
David
abode
in
the
wilderness
in
strong
holds,
and
remained
in
a
mountain
in
the
wilderness
of
Ziph.
And
Saul
sought
him
every
day,
but
God
delivered
him
not
into
his
hand.
023:015
And
David
saw
that
Saul
was
come
out
to
seek
his
life:
and
David
was
in
the
wilderness
of
Ziph
in
a
wood.
023:016
And
Jonathan
Saul's
son
arose,
and
went
to
David
into
the
wood,
and
strengthened
his
hand
in
God.
023:017
And
he
said
unto
him,
Fear
not:
for
the
hand
of
Saul
my
father
shall
not
find
thee;
and
thou
shalt
be
king
over
Israel,
and
I
shall
be
next
unto
thee;
and
that
also
Saul
my
father
knoweth.
023:018
And
they
two
made
a
covenant
before
the
LORD:
and
David
abode
in
the
wood,
and
Jonathan
went
to
his
house.
023:019
Then
came
up
the
Ziphites
to
Saul
to
Gibeah,
saying,
Doth
not
David
hide
himself
with
us
in
strong
holds
in
the
wood,
in
the
hill
of
Hachilah,
which
is
on
the
south
of
Jeshimon?
023:020
Now
therefore,
O
king,
come
down
according
to
all
the
desire
of
thy
soul
to
come
down;
and
our
part
shall
be
to
deliver
him
into
the
king's
hand.
023:021
And
Saul
said,
Blessed
be
ye
of
the
LORD;
for
ye
have
compassion
on
me.
023:022
Go,
I
pray
you,
prepare
yet,
and
know
and
see
his
place
where
his
haunt
is,
and
who
hath
seen
him
there:
for
it
is
told
me
that
he
dealeth
very
subtilly.
023:023
See
therefore,
and
take
knowledge
of
all
the
lurking
places
where
he
hideth
himself,
and
come
ye
again
to
me
with
the
certainty,
and
I
will
go
with
you:
and
it
shall
come
to
pass,
if
he
be
in
the
land,
that
I
will
search
him
out
throughout
all
the
thousands
of
Judah.
023:024
And
they
arose,
and
went
to
Ziph
before
Saul:
but
David
and
his
men
were
in
the
wilderness
of
Maon,
in
the
plain
on
the
south
of
Jeshimon.
023:025
Saul
also
and
his
men
went
to
seek
him.
And
they
told
David;
wherefore
he
came
down
into
a
rock,
and
abode
in
the
wilderness
of
Maon.
And
when
Saul
heard
that,
he
pursued
after
David
in
the
wilderness
of
Maon.
023:026
And
Saul
went
on
this
side
of
the
mountain,
and
David
and
his
men
on
that
side
of
the
mountain:
and
David
made
haste
to
get
away
for
fear
of
Saul;
for
Saul
and
his
men
compassed
David
and
his
men
round
about
to
take
them.
023:027
But
there
came
a
messenger
unto
Saul,
saying,
Haste
thee,
and
come;
for
the
Philistines
have
invaded
the
land.
023:028
Wherefore
Saul
returned
from
pursuing
after
David,
and
went
against
the
Philistines:
therefore
they
called
that
place
Selahammahlekoth.
023:029
And
David
went
up
from
thence,
and
dwelt
in
strong
holds
at
Engedi.
024:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Saul
was
returned
from
following
the
Philistines,
that
it
was
told
him,
saying,
Behold,
David
is
in
the
wilderness
of
Engedi.
024:002
Then
Saul
took
three
thousand
chosen
men
out
of
all
Israel,
and
went
to
seek
David
and
his
men
upon
the
rocks
of
the
wild
goats.
024:003
And
he
came
to
the
sheepcotes
by
the
way,
where
was
a
cave;
and
Saul
went
in
to
cover
his
feet:
and
David
and
his
men
remained
in
the
sides
of
the
cave.
024:004
And
the
men
of
David
said
unto
him,
Behold
the
day
of
which
the
LORD
said
unto
thee,
Behold,
I
will
deliver
thine
enemy
into
thine
hand,
that
thou
mayest
do
to
him
as
it
shall
seem
good
unto
thee.
Then
David
arose,
and
cut
off
the
skirt
of
Saul's
robe
privily.
024:005
And
it
came
to
pass
afterward,
that
David's
heart
smote
him,
because
he
had
cut
off
Saul's
skirt.
024:006
And
he
said
unto
his
men,
The
LORD
forbid
that
I
should
do
this
thing
unto
my
master,
the
LORD's
anointed,
to
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
him,
seeing
he
is
the
anointed
of
the
LORD.
024:007
So
David
stayed
his
servants
with
these
words,
and
suffered
them
not
to
rise
against
Saul.
But
Saul
rose
up
out
of
the
cave,
and
went
on
his
way.
024:008
David
also
arose
afterward,
and
went
out
of
the
cave,
and
cried
after
Saul,
saying,
My
lord
the
king.
And
when
Saul
looked
behind
him,
David
stooped
with
his
face
to
the
earth,
and
bowed
himself.
024:009
And
David
said
to
Saul,
Wherefore
hearest
thou
men's
words,
saying,
Behold,
David
seeketh
thy
hurt?
024:010
Behold,
this
day
thine
eyes
have
seen
how
that
the
LORD
had
delivered
thee
to
day
into
mine
hand
in
the
cave:
and
some
bade
me
kill
thee:
but
mine
eye
spared
thee;
and
I
said,
I
will
not
put
forth
mine
hand
against
my
lord;
for
he
is
the
LORD's
anointed.
024:011
Moreover,
my
father,
see,
yea,
see
the
skirt
of
thy
robe
in
my
hand:
for
in
that
I
cut
off
the
skirt
of
thy
robe,
and
killed
thee
not,
know
thou
and
see
that
there
is
neither
evil
nor
transgression
in
mine
hand,
and
I
have
not
sinned
against
thee;
yet
thou
huntest
my
soul
to
take
it.
024:012
The
LORD
judge
between
me
and
thee,
and
the
LORD
avenge
me
of
thee:
but
mine
hand
shall
not
be
upon
thee.
024:013
As
saith
the
proverb
of
the
ancients,
Wickedness
proceedeth
from
the
wicked:
but
mine
hand
shall
not
be
upon
thee.
024:014
After
whom
is
the
king
of
Israel
come
out?
after
whom
dost
thou
pursue?
after
a
dead
dog,
after
a
flea.
024:015
The
LORD
therefore
be
judge,
and
judge
between
me
and
thee,
and
see,
and
plead
my
cause,
and
deliver
me
out
of
thine
hand.
024:016
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
David
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
unto
Saul,
that
Saul
said,
Is
this
thy
voice,
my
son
David?
And
Saul
lifted
up
his
voice,
and
wept.
024:017
And
he
said
to
David,
Thou
art
more
righteous
than
I:
for
thou
hast
rewarded
me
good,
whereas
I
have
rewarded
thee
evil.
024:018
And
thou
hast
shewed
this
day
how
that
thou
hast
dealt
well
with
me:
forasmuch
as
when
the
LORD
had
delivered
me
into
thine
hand,
thou
killedst
me
not.
024:019
For
if
a
man
find
his
enemy,
will
he
let
him
go
well
away?
wherefore
the
LORD
reward
thee
good
for
that
thou
hast
done
unto
me
this
day.
024:020
And
now,
behold,
I
know
well
that
thou
shalt
surely
be
king,
and
that
the
kingdom
of
Israel
shall
be
established
in
thine
hand.
024:021
Swear
now
therefore
unto
me
by
the
LORD,
that
thou
wilt
not
cut
off
my
seed
after
me,
and
that
thou
wilt
not
destroy
my
name
out
of
my
father's
house.
024:022
And
David
sware
unto
Saul.
And
Saul
went
home;
but
David
and
his
men
gat
them
up
unto
the
hold.
025:001
And
Samuel
died;
and
all
the
Israelites
were
gathered
together,
and
lamented
him,
and
buried
him
in
his
house
at
Ramah.
And
David
arose,
and
went
down
to
the
wilderness
of
Paran.
025:002
And
there
was
a
man
in
Maon,
whose
possessions
were
in
Carmel;
and
the
man
was
very
great,
and
he
had
three
thousand
sheep,
and
a
thousand
goats:
and
he
was
shearing
his
sheep
in
Carmel.
025:003
Now
the
name
of
the
man
was
Nabal;
and
the
name
of
his
wife
Abigail:
and
she
was
a
woman
of
good
understanding,
and
of
a
beautiful
countenance:
but
the
man
was
churlish
and
evil
in
his
doings;
and
he
was
of
the
house
of
Caleb.
025:004
And
David
heard
in
the
wilderness
that
Nabal
did
shear
his
sheep.
025:005
And
David
sent
out
ten
young
men,
and
David
said
unto
the
young
men,
Get
you
up
to
Carmel,
and
go
to
Nabal,
and
greet
him
in
my
name:
025:006
And
thus
shall
ye
say
to
him
that
liveth
in
prosperity,
Peace
be
both
to
thee,
and
peace
be
to
thine
house,
and
peace
be
unto
all
that
thou
hast.
025:007
And
now
I
have
heard
that
thou
hast
shearers:
now
thy
shepherds
which
were
with
us,
we
hurt
them
not,
neither
was
there
ought
missing
unto
them,
all
the
while
they
were
in
Carmel.
025:008
Ask
thy
young
men,
and
they
will
shew
thee.
Wherefore
let
the
young
men
find
favour
in
thine
eyes:
for
we
come
in
a
good
day:
give,
I
pray
thee,
whatsoever
cometh
to
thine
hand
unto
thy
servants,
and
to
thy
son
David.
025:009
And
when
