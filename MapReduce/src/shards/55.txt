David's
young
men
came,
they
spake
to
Nabal
according
to
all
those
words
in
the
name
of
David,
and
ceased.
025:010
And
Nabal
answered
David's
servants,
and
said,
Who
is
David?
and
who
is
the
son
of
Jesse?
there
be
many
servants
now
a
days
that
break
away
every
man
from
his
master.
025:011
Shall
I
then
take
my
bread,
and
my
water,
and
my
flesh
that
I
have
killed
for
my
shearers,
and
give
it
unto
men,
whom
I
know
not
whence
they
be?
025:012
So
David's
young
men
turned
their
way,
and
went
again,
and
came
and
told
him
all
those
sayings.
025:013
And
David
said
unto
his
men,
Gird
ye
on
every
man
his
sword.
And
they
girded
on
every
man
his
sword;
and
David
also
girded
on
his
sword:
and
there
went
up
after
David
about
four
hundred
men;
and
two
hundred
abode
by
the
stuff.
025:014
But
one
of
the
young
men
told
Abigail,
Nabal's
wife,
saying,
Behold,
David
sent
messengers
out
of
the
wilderness
to
salute
our
master;
and
he
railed
on
them.
025:015
But
the
men
were
very
good
unto
us,
and
we
were
not
hurt,
neither
missed
we
any
thing,
as
long
as
we
were
conversant
with
them,
when
we
were
in
the
fields:
025:016
They
were
a
wall
unto
us
both
by
night
and
day,
all
the
while
we
were
with
them
keeping
the
sheep.
025:017
Now
therefore
know
and
consider
what
thou
wilt
do;
for
evil
is
determined
against
our
master,
and
against
all
his
household:
for
he
is
such
a
son
of
Belial,
that
a
man
cannot
speak
to
him.
025:018
Then
Abigail
made
haste,
and
took
two
hundred
loaves,
and
two
bottles
of
wine,
and
five
sheep
ready
dressed,
and
five
measures
of
parched
corn,
and
an
hundred
clusters
of
raisins,
and
two
hundred
cakes
of
figs,
and
laid
them
on
asses.
025:019
And
she
said
unto
her
servants,
Go
on
before
me;
behold,
I
come
after
you.
But
she
told
not
her
husband
Nabal.
025:020
And
it
was
so,
as
she
rode
on
the
ass,
that
she
came
down
by
the
covert
on
the
hill,
and,
behold,
David
and
his
men
came
down
against
her;
and
she
met
them.
025:021
Now
David
had
said,
Surely
in
vain
have
I
kept
all
that
this
fellow
hath
in
the
wilderness,
so
that
nothing
was
missed
of
all
that
pertained
unto
him:
and
he
hath
requited
me
evil
for
good.
025:022
So
and
more
also
do
God
unto
the
enemies
of
David,
if
I
leave
of
all
that
pertain
to
him
by
the
morning
light
any
that
pisseth
against
the
wall.
025:023
And
when
Abigail
saw
David,
she
hasted,
and
lighted
off
the
ass,
and
fell
before
David
on
her
face,
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground,
025:024
And
fell
at
his
feet,
and
said,
Upon
me,
my
lord,
upon
me
let
this
iniquity
be:
and
let
thine
handmaid,
I
pray
thee,
speak
in
thine
audience,
and
hear
the
words
of
thine
handmaid.
025:025
Let
not
my
lord,
I
pray
thee,
regard
this
man
of
Belial,
even
Nabal:
for
as
his
name
is,
so
is
he;
Nabal
is
his
name,
and
folly
is
with
him:
but
I
thine
handmaid
saw
not
the
young
men
of
my
lord,
whom
thou
didst
send.
025:026
Now
therefore,
my
lord,
as
the
LORD
liveth,
and
as
thy
soul
liveth,
seeing
the
LORD
hath
withholden
thee
from
coming
to
shed
blood,
and
from
avenging
thyself
with
thine
own
hand,
now
let
thine
enemies,
and
they
that
seek
evil
to
my
lord,
be
as
Nabal.
025:027
And
now
this
blessing
which
thine
handmaid
hath
brought
unto
my
lord,
let
it
even
be
given
unto
the
young
men
that
follow
my
lord.
025:028
I
pray
thee,
forgive
the
trespass
of
thine
handmaid:
for
the
LORD
will
certainly
make
my
lord
a
sure
house;
because
my
lord
fighteth
the
battles
of
the
LORD,
and
evil
hath
not
been
found
in
thee
all
thy
days.
025:029
Yet
a
man
is
risen
to
pursue
thee,
and
to
seek
thy
soul:
but
the
soul
of
my
lord
shall
be
bound
in
the
bundle
of
life
with
the
LORD
thy
God;
and
the
souls
of
thine
enemies,
them
shall
he
sling
out,
as
out
of
the
middle
of
a
sling.
025:030
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
the
LORD
shall
have
done
to
my
lord
according
to
all
the
good
that
he
hath
spoken
concerning
thee,
and
shall
have
appointed
thee
ruler
over
Israel;
025:031
That
this
shall
be
no
grief
unto
thee,
nor
offence
of
heart
unto
my
lord,
either
that
thou
hast
shed
blood
causeless,
or
that
my
lord
hath
avenged
himself:
but
when
the
LORD
shall
have
dealt
well
with
my
lord,
then
remember
thine
handmaid.
025:032
And
David
said
to
Abigail,
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
which
sent
thee
this
day
to
meet
me:
025:033
And
blessed
be
thy
advice,
and
blessed
be
thou,
which
hast
kept
me
this
day
from
coming
to
shed
blood,
and
from
avenging
myself
with
mine
own
hand.
025:034
For
in
very
deed,
as
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
liveth,
which
hath
kept
me
back
from
hurting
thee,
except
thou
hadst
hasted
and
come
to
meet
me,
surely
there
had
not
been
left
unto
Nabal
by
the
morning
light
any
that
pisseth
against
the
wall.
025:035
So
David
received
of
her
hand
that
which
she
had
brought
him,
and
said
unto
her,
Go
up
in
peace
to
thine
house;
see,
I
have
hearkened
to
thy
voice,
and
have
accepted
thy
person.
025:036
And
Abigail
came
to
Nabal;
and,
behold,
he
held
a
feast
in
his
house,
like
the
feast
of
a
king;
and
Nabal's
heart
was
merry
within
him,
for
he
was
very
drunken:
wherefore
she
told
him
nothing,
less
or
more,
until
the
morning
light.
025:037
But
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning,
when
the
wine
was
gone
out
of
Nabal,
and
his
wife
had
told
him
these
things,
that
his
heart
died
within
him,
and
he
became
as
a
stone.
025:038
And
it
came
to
pass
about
ten
days
after,
that
the
LORD
smote
Nabal,
that
he
died.
025:039
And
when
David
heard
that
Nabal
was
dead,
he
said,
Blessed
be
the
LORD,
that
hath
pleaded
the
cause
of
my
reproach
from
the
hand
of
Nabal,
and
hath
kept
his
servant
from
evil:
for
the
LORD
hath
returned
the
wickedness
of
Nabal
upon
his
own
head.
And
David
sent
and
communed
with
Abigail,
to
take
her
to
him
to
wife.
025:040
And
when
the
servants
of
David
were
come
to
Abigail
to
Carmel,
they
spake
unto
her,
saying,
David
sent
us
unto
thee,
to
take
thee
to
him
to
wife.
025:041
And
she
arose,
and
bowed
herself
on
her
face
to
the
earth,
and
said,
Behold,
let
thine
handmaid
be
a
servant
to
wash
the
feet
of
the
servants
of
my
lord.
025:042
And
Abigail
hasted,
and
arose
and
rode
upon
an
ass,
with
five
damsels
of
hers
that
went
after
her;
and
she
went
after
the
messengers
of
David,
and
became
his
wife.
025:043
David
also
took
Ahinoam
of
Jezreel;
and
they
were
also
both
of
them
his
wives.
025:044
But
Saul
had
given
Michal
his
daughter,
David's
wife,
to
Phalti
the
son
of
Laish,
which
was
of
Gallim.
026:001
And
the
Ziphites
came
unto
Saul
to
Gibeah,
saying,
Doth
not
David
hide
himself
in
the
hill
of
Hachilah,
which
is
before
Jeshimon?
026:002
Then
Saul
arose,
and
went
down
to
the
wilderness
of
Ziph,
having
three
thousand
chosen
men
of
Israel
with
him,
to
seek
David
in
the
wilderness
of
Ziph.
026:003
And
Saul
pitched
in
the
hill
of
Hachilah,
which
is
before
Jeshimon,
by
the
way.
But
David
abode
in
the
wilderness,
and
he
saw
that
Saul
came
after
him
into
the
wilderness.
026:004
David
therefore
sent
out
spies,
and
understood
that
Saul
was
come
in
very
deed.
026:005
And
David
arose,
and
came
to
the
place
where
Saul
had
pitched:
and
David
beheld
the
place
where
Saul
lay,
and
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
the
captain
of
his
host:
and
Saul
lay
in
the
trench,
and
the
people
pitched
round
about
him.
026:006
Then
answered
David
and
said
to
Ahimelech
the
Hittite,
and
to
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
brother
to
Joab,
saying,
Who
will
go
down
with
me
to
Saul
to
the
camp?
And
Abishai
said,
I
will
go
down
with
thee.
026:007
So
David
and
Abishai
came
to
the
people
by
night:
and,
behold,
Saul
lay
sleeping
within
the
trench,
and
his
spear
stuck
in
the
ground
at
his
bolster:
but
Abner
and
the
people
lay
round
about
him.
026:008
Then
said
Abishai
to
David,
God
hath
delivered
thine
enemy
into
thine
hand
this
day:
now
therefore
let
me
smite
him,
I
pray
thee,
with
the
spear
even
to
the
earth
at
once,
and
I
will
not
smite
him
the
second
time.
026:009
And
David
said
to
Abishai,
Destroy
him
not:
for
who
can
stretch
forth
his
hand
against
the
LORD's
anointed,
and
be
guiltless?
026:010
David
said
furthermore,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
the
LORD
shall
smite
him;
or
his
day
shall
come
to
die;
or
he
shall
descend
into
battle,
and
perish.
026:011
The
LORD
forbid
that
I
should
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
the
LORD's
anointed:
but,
I
pray
thee,
take
thou
now
the
spear
that
is
at
his
bolster,
and
the
cruse
of
water,
and
let
us
go.
026:012
So
David
took
the
spear
and
the
cruse
of
water
from
Saul's
bolster;
and
they
gat
them
away,
and
no
man
saw
it,
nor
knew
it,
neither
awaked:
for
they
were
all
asleep;
because
a
deep
sleep
from
the
LORD
was
fallen
upon
them.
026:013
Then
David
went
over
to
the
other
side,
and
stood
on
the
top
of
an
hill
afar
off;
a
great
space
being
between
them:
026:014
And
David
cried
to
the
people,
and
to
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
saying,
Answerest
thou
not,
Abner?
Then
Abner
answered
and
said,
Who
art
thou
that
criest
to
the
king?
026:015
And
David
said
to
Abner,
Art
not
thou
a
valiant
man?
and
who
is
like
to
thee
in
Israel?
wherefore
then
hast
thou
not
kept
thy
lord
the
king?
for
there
came
one
of
the
people
in
to
destroy
the
king
thy
lord.
026:016
This
thing
is
not
good
that
thou
hast
done.
As
the
LORD
liveth,
ye
are
worthy
to
die,
because
ye
have
not
kept
your
master,
the
LORD's
anointed.
And
now
see
where
the
king's
spear
is,
and
the
cruse
of
water
that
was
at
his
bolster.
026:017
And
Saul
knew
David's
voice,
and
said,
Is
this
thy
voice,
my
son
David?
And
David
said,
It
is
my
voice,
my
lord,
O
king.
026:018
And
he
said,
Wherefore
doth
my
lord
thus
pursue
after
his
servant?
for
what
have
I
done?
or
what
evil
is
in
mine
hand?
026:019
Now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
let
my
lord
the
king
hear
the
words
of
his
servant.
If
the
LORD
have
stirred
thee
up
against
me,
let
him
accept
an
offering:
but
if
they
be
the
children
of
men,
cursed
be
they
before
the
LORD;
for
they
have
driven
me
out
this
day
from
abiding
in
the
inheritance
of
the
LORD,
saying,
Go,
serve
other
gods.
026:020
Now
therefore,
let
not
my
blood
fall
to
the
earth
before
the
face
of
the
LORD:
for
the
king
of
Israel
is
come
out
to
seek
a
flea,
as
when
one
doth
hunt
a
partridge
in
the
mountains.
026:021
Then
said
Saul,
I
have
sinned:
return,
my
son
David:
for
I
will
no
more
do
thee
harm,
because
my
soul
was
precious
in
thine
eyes
this
day:
behold,
I
have
played
the
fool,
and
have
erred
exceedingly.
026:022
And
David
answered
and
said,
Behold
the
king's
spear!
and
let
one
of
the
young
men
come
over
and
fetch
it.
026:023
The
LORD
render
to
every
man
his
righteousness
and
his
faithfulness;
for
the
LORD
delivered
thee
into
my
hand
to
day,
but
I
would
not
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
the
LORD's
anointed.
026:024
And,
behold,
as
thy
life
was
much
set
by
this
day
in
mine
eyes,
so
let
my
life
be
much
set
by
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
and
let
him
deliver
me
out
of
all
tribulation.
026:025
Then
Saul
said
to
David,
Blessed
be
thou,
my
son
David:
thou
shalt
both
do
great
things,
and
also
shalt
still
prevail.
So
David
went
on
his
way,
and
Saul
returned
to
his
place.
027:001
And
David
said
in
his
heart,
I
shall
now
perish
one
day
by
the
hand
of
Saul:
there
is
nothing
better
for
me
than
that
I
should
speedily
escape
into
the
land
of
the
Philistines;
and
Saul
shall
despair
of
me,
to
seek
me
any
more
in
any
coast
of
Israel:
so
shall
I
escape
out
of
his
hand.
027:002
And
David
arose,
and
he
passed
over
with
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
unto
Achish,
the
son
of
Maoch,
king
of
Gath.
027:003
And
David
dwelt
with
Achish
at
Gath,
he
and
his
men,
every
man
with
his
household,
even
David
with
his
two
wives,
Ahinoam
the
Jezreelitess,
and
Abigail
the
Carmelitess,
Nabal's
wife.
027:004
And
it
was
told
Saul
that
David
was
fled
to
Gath:
and
he
sought
no
more
again
for
him.
027:005
And
David
said
unto
Achish,
If
I
have
now
found
grace
in
thine
eyes,
let
them
give
me
a
place
in
some
town
in
the
country,
that
I
may
dwell
there:
for
why
should
thy
servant
dwell
in
the
royal
city
with
thee?
027:006
Then
Achish
gave
him
Ziklag
that
day:
wherefore
Ziklag
pertaineth
unto
the
kings
of
Judah
unto
this
day.
027:007
And
the
time
that
David
dwelt
in
the
country
of
the
Philistines
was
a
full
year
and
four
months.
027:008
And
David
and
his
men
went
up,
and
invaded
the
Geshurites,
and
the
Gezrites,
and
the
Amalekites:
for
those
nations
were
of
old
the
inhabitants
of
the
land,
as
thou
goest
to
Shur,
even
unto
the
land
of
Egypt.
027:009
And
David
smote
the
land,
and
left
neither
man
nor
woman
alive,
and
took
away
the
sheep,
and
the
oxen,
and
the
asses,
and
the
camels,
and
the
apparel,
and
returned,
and
came
to
Achish.
027:010
And
Achish
said,
Whither
have
ye
made
a
road
to
day?
And
David
said,
Against
the
south
of
Judah,
and
against
the
south
of
the
Jerahmeelites,
and
against
the
south
of
the
Kenites.
027:011
And
David
saved
neither
man
nor
woman
alive,
to
bring
tidings
to
Gath,
saying,
Lest
they
should
tell
on
us,
saying,
So
did
David,
and
so
will
be
his
manner
all
the
while
he
dwelleth
in
the
country
of
the
Philistines.
027:012
And
Achish
believed
David,
saying,
He
hath
made
his
people
Israel
utterly
to
abhor
him;
therefore
he
shall
be
my
servant
for
ever.
028:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days,
that
the
Philistines
gathered
their
armies
together
for
warfare,
to
fight
with
Israel.
And
Achish
said
unto
David,
Know
thou
assuredly,
that
thou
shalt
go
out
with
me
to
battle,
thou
and
thy
men.
028:002
And
David
said
to
Achish,
Surely
thou
shalt
know
what
thy
servant
can
do.
And
Achish
said
to
David,
Therefore
will
I
make
thee
keeper
of
mine
head
for
ever.
028:003
Now
Samuel
was
dead,
and
all
Israel
had
lamented
him,
and
buried
him
in
Ramah,
even
in
his
own
city.
And
Saul
had
put
away
those
that
had
familiar
spirits,
and
the
wizards,
out
of
the
land.
028:004
And
the
Philistines
gathered
themselves
together,
and
came
and
pitched
in
Shunem:
and
Saul
gathered
all
Israel
together,
and
they
pitched
in
Gilboa.
028:005
And
when
Saul
saw
the
host
of
the
Philistines,
he
was
afraid,
and
his
heart
greatly
trembled.
028:006
And
when
Saul
enquired
of
the
LORD,
the
LORD
answered
him
not,
neither
by
dreams,
nor
by
Urim,
nor
by
prophets.
028:007
Then
said
Saul
unto
his
servants,
Seek
me
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit,
that
I
may
go
to
her,
and
enquire
of
her.
And
his
servants
said
to
him,
Behold,
there
is
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
at
Endor.
028:008
And
Saul
disguised
himself,
and
put
on
other
raiment,
and
he
went,
and
two
men
with
him,
and
they
came
to
the
woman
by
night:
and
he
said,
I
pray
thee,
divine
unto
me
by
the
familiar
spirit,
and
bring
me
him
up,
whom
I
shall
name
unto
thee.
028:009
And
the
woman
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thou
knowest
what
Saul
hath
done,
how
he
hath
cut
off
those
that
have
familiar
spirits,
and
the
wizards,
out
of
the
land:
wherefore
then
layest
thou
a
snare
for
my
life,
to
cause
me
to
die?
028:010
And
Saul
sware
to
her
by
the
LORD,
saying,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
there
shall
no
punishment
happen
to
thee
for
this
thing.
028:011
Then
said
the
woman,
Whom
shall
I
bring
up
unto
thee?
And
he
said,
Bring
me
up
Samuel.
028:012
And
when
the
woman
saw
Samuel,
she
cried
with
a
loud
voice:
and
the
woman
spake
to
Saul,
saying,
Why
hast
thou
deceived
me?
for
thou
art
Saul.
028:013
And
the
king
said
unto
her,
Be
not
afraid:
for
what
sawest
thou?
And
the
woman
said
unto
Saul,
I
saw
gods
ascending
out
of
the
earth.
028:014
And
he
said
unto
her,
What
form
is
he
of?
And
she
said,
An
old
man
cometh
up;
and
he
is
covered
with
a
mantle.
And
Saul
perceived
that
it
was
Samuel,
and
he
stooped
with
his
face
to
the
ground,
and
bowed
himself.
028:015
And
Samuel
said
to
Saul,
Why
hast
thou
disquieted
me,
to
bring
me
up?
And
Saul
answered,
I
am
sore
distressed;
for
the
Philistines
make
war
against
me,
and
God
is
departed
from
me,
and
answereth
me
no
more,
neither
by
prophets,
nor
by
dreams:
therefore
I
have
called
thee,
that
thou
mayest
make
known
unto
me
what
I
shall
do.
028:016
Then
said
Samuel,
Wherefore
then
dost
thou
ask
of
me,
seeing
the
LORD
is
departed
from
thee,
and
is
become
thine
enemy?
028:017
And
the
LORD
hath
done
to
him,
as
he
spake
by
me:
for
the
LORD
hath
rent
the
kingdom
out
of
thine
hand,
and
given
it
to
thy
neighbour,
even
to
David:
028:018
Because
thou
obeyedst
not
the
voice
of
the
LORD,
nor
executedst
his
fierce
wrath
upon
Amalek,
therefore
hath
the
LORD
done
this
thing
unto
thee
this
day.
028:019
Moreover
the
LORD
will
also
deliver
Israel
with
thee
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines:
and
to
morrow
shalt
thou
and
thy
sons
be
with
me:
the
LORD
also
shall
deliver
the
host
of
Israel
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines.
028:020
Then
Saul
fell
straightway
all
along
on
the
earth,
and
was
sore
afraid,
because
of
the
words
of
Samuel:
and
there
was
no
strength
in
him;
for
he
had
eaten
no
bread
all
the
day,
nor
all
the
night.
028:021
And
the
woman
came
unto
Saul,
and
saw
that
he
was
sore
troubled,
and
said
unto
him,
Behold,
thine
handmaid
hath
obeyed
thy
voice,
and
I
have
put
my
life
in
my
hand,
and
have
hearkened
unto
thy
words
which
thou
spakest
unto
me.
028:022
Now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
hearken
thou
also
unto
the
voice
of
thine
handmaid,
and
let
me
set
a
morsel
of
bread
before
thee;
and
eat,
that
thou
mayest
have
strength,
when
thou
goest
on
thy
way.
028:023
But
he
refused,
and
said,
I
will
not
eat.
But
his
servants,
together
with
the
woman,
compelled
him;
and
he
hearkened
unto
their
voice.
So
he
arose
from
the
earth,
and
sat
upon
the
bed.
028:024
And
the
woman
had
a
fat
calf
in
the
house;
and
she
hasted,
and
killed
it,
and
took
flour,
and
kneaded
it,
and
did
bake
unleavened
bread
thereof:
028:025
And
she
brought
it
before
Saul,
and
before
his
servants;
and
they
did
eat.
Then
they
rose
up,
and
went
away
that
night.
029:001
Now
the
Philistines
gathered
together
all
their
armies
to
Aphek:
and
the
Israelites
pitched
by
a
fountain
which
is
in
Jezreel.
029:002
And
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
passed
on
by
hundreds,
and
by
thousands:
but
David
and
his
men
passed
on
in
the
rereward
with
Achish.
029:003
Then
said
the
princes
of
the
Philistines,
What
do
these
Hebrews
here?
And
Achish
said
unto
the
princes
of
the
Philistines,
Is
not
this
David,
the
servant
of
Saul
the
king
of
Israel,
which
hath
been
with
me
these
days,
or
these
years,
and
I
have
found
no
fault
in
him
since
he
fell
unto
me
unto
this
day?
029:004
And
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
were
wroth
with
him;
and
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
said
unto
him,
Make
this
fellow
return,
that
he
may
go
again
to
his
place
which
thou
hast
appointed
him,
and
let
him
not
go
down
with
us
to
battle,
lest
in
the
battle
he
be
an
adversary
to
us:
for
wherewith
should
he
reconcile
himself
unto
his
master?
should
it
not
be
with
the
heads
of
these
men?
029:005
Is
not
this
David,
of
whom
they
sang
one
to
another
in
dances,
saying,
Saul
slew
his
thousands,
and
David
his
ten
thousands?
029:006
Then
Achish
called
David,
and
said
unto
him,
Surely,
as
the
LORD
liveth,
thou
hast
been
upright,
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
with
me
in
the
host
is
good
in
my
sight:
for
I
have
not
found
evil
in
thee
since
the
day
of
thy
coming
unto
me
unto
this
day:
nevertheless
the
lords
favour
thee
not.
029:007
Wherefore
now
return,
and
go
in
peace,
that
thou
displease
not
the
lords
of
the
Philistines.
029:008
And
David
said
unto
Achish,
But
what
have
I
done?
and
what
hast
thou
found
in
thy
servant
so
long
as
I
have
been
with
thee
unto
this
day,
that
I
may
not
go
fight
against
the
enemies
of
my
lord
the
king?
029:009
And
Achish
answered
and
said
to
David,
I
know
that
thou
art
good
in
my
sight,
as
an
angel
of
God:
notwithstanding
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
have
said,
He
shall
not
go
up
with
us
to
the
battle.
029:010
Wherefore
now
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
with
thy
master's
servants
that
are
come
with
thee:
and
as
soon
as
ye
be
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
have
light,
depart.
029:011
So
David
and
his
men
rose
up
early
to
depart
in
the
morning,
to
return
into
the
land
of
the
Philistines.
And
the
Philistines
went
up
to
Jezreel.
030:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
David
and
his
men
were
come
to
Ziklag
on
the
third
day,
that
the
Amalekites
had
invaded
the
south,
and
Ziklag,
and
smitten
Ziklag,
and
burned
it
with
fire;
030:002
And
had
taken
the
women
captives,
that
were
therein:
they
slew
not
any,
either
great
or
small,
but
carried
them
away,
and
went
on
their
way.
030:003
So
David
and
his
men
came
to
the
city,
and,
behold,
it
was
burned
with
fire;
and
their
wives,
and
their
sons,
and
their
daughters,
were
taken
captives.
030:004
Then
David
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept,
until
they
had
no
more
power
to
weep.
030:005
And
David's
two
wives
were
taken
captives,
Ahinoam
the
Jezreelitess,
and
Abigail
the
wife
of
Nabal
the
Carmelite.
030:006
And
David
was
greatly
distressed;
for
the
people
spake
of
stoning
him,
because
the
soul
of
all
the
people
was
grieved,
every
man
for
his
sons
and
for
his
daughters:
but
David
encouraged
himself
in
the
LORD
his
God.
030:007
And
David
said
to
Abiathar
the
priest,
Ahimelech's
son,
I
pray
thee,
bring
me
hither
the
ephod.
And
Abiathar
brought
thither
the
ephod
to
David.
030:008
And
David
enquired
at
the
LORD,
saying,
Shall
I
pursue
after
this
troop?
shall
I
overtake
them?
And
he
answered
him,
Pursue:
for
thou
shalt
surely
overtake
them,
and
without
fail
recover
all.
030:009
So
David
went,
he
and
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him,
and
came
to
the
brook
Besor,
where
those
that
were
left
behind
stayed.
030:010
But
David
pursued,
he
and
four
hundred
men:
for
two
hundred
abode
behind,
which
were
so
faint
that
they
could
not
go
over
the
brook
Besor.
030:011
And
they
found
an
Egyptian
in
the
field,
and
brought
him
to
David,
and
gave
him
bread,
and
he
did
