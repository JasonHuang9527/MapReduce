eat;
and
they
made
him
drink
water;
030:012
And
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
a
cake
of
figs,
and
two
clusters
of
raisins:
and
when
he
had
eaten,
his
spirit
came
again
to
him:
for
he
had
eaten
no
bread,
nor
drunk
any
water,
three
days
and
three
nights.
030:013
And
David
said
unto
him,
To
whom
belongest
thou?
and
whence
art
thou?
And
he
said,
I
am
a
young
man
of
Egypt,
servant
to
an
Amalekite;
and
my
master
left
me,
because
three
days
agone
I
fell
sick.
030:014
We
made
an
invasion
upon
the
south
of
the
Cherethites,
and
upon
the
coast
which
belongeth
to
Judah,
and
upon
the
south
of
Caleb;
and
we
burned
Ziklag
with
fire.
030:015
And
David
said
to
him,
Canst
thou
bring
me
down
to
this
company?
And
he
said,
Swear
unto
me
by
God,
that
thou
wilt
neither
kill
me,
nor
deliver
me
into
the
hands
of
my
master,
and
I
will
bring
thee
down
to
this
company.
030:016
And
when
he
had
brought
him
down,
behold,
they
were
spread
abroad
upon
all
the
earth,
eating
and
drinking,
and
dancing,
because
of
all
the
great
spoil
that
they
had
taken
out
of
the
land
of
the
Philistines,
and
out
of
the
land
of
Judah.
030:017
And
David
smote
them
from
the
twilight
even
unto
the
evening
of
the
next
day:
and
there
escaped
not
a
man
of
them,
save
four
hundred
young
men,
which
rode
upon
camels,
and
fled.
030:018
And
David
recovered
all
that
the
Amalekites
had
carried
away:
and
David
rescued
his
two
wives.
030:019
And
there
was
nothing
lacking
to
them,
neither
small
nor
great,
neither
sons
nor
daughters,
neither
spoil,
nor
any
thing
that
they
had
taken
to
them:
David
recovered
all.
030:020
And
David
took
all
the
flocks
and
the
herds,
which
they
drave
before
those
other
cattle,
and
said,
This
is
David's
spoil.
030:021
And
David
came
to
the
two
hundred
men,
which
were
so
faint
that
they
could
not
follow
David,
whom
they
had
made
also
to
abide
at
the
brook
Besor:
and
they
went
forth
to
meet
David,
and
to
meet
the
people
that
were
with
him:
and
when
David
came
near
to
the
people,
he
saluted
them.
030:022
Then
answered
all
the
wicked
men
and
men
of
Belial,
of
those
that
went
with
David,
and
said,
Because
they
went
not
with
us,
we
will
not
give
them
ought
of
the
spoil
that
we
have
recovered,
save
to
every
man
his
wife
and
his
children,
that
they
may
lead
them
away,
and
depart.
030:023
Then
said
David,
Ye
shall
not
do
so,
my
brethren,
with
that
which
the
LORD
hath
given
us,
who
hath
preserved
us,
and
delivered
the
company
that
came
against
us
into
our
hand.
030:024
For
who
will
hearken
unto
you
in
this
matter?
but
as
his
part
is
that
goeth
down
to
the
battle,
so
shall
his
part
be
that
tarrieth
by
the
stuff:
they
shall
part
alike.
030:025
And
it
was
so
from
that
day
forward,
that
he
made
it
a
statute
and
an
ordinance
for
Israel
unto
this
day.
030:026
And
when
David
came
to
Ziklag,
he
sent
of
the
spoil
unto
the
elders
of
Judah,
even
to
his
friends,
saying,
Behold
a
present
for
you
of
the
spoil
of
the
enemies
of
the
LORD;
030:027
To
them
which
were
in
Bethel,
and
to
them
which
were
in
south
Ramoth,
and
to
them
which
were
in
Jattir,
030:028
And
to
them
which
were
in
Aroer,
and
to
them
which
were
in
Siphmoth,
and
to
them
which
were
in
Eshtemoa,
030:029
And
to
them
which
were
in
Rachal,
and
to
them
which
were
in
the
cities
of
the
Jerahmeelites,
and
to
them
which
were
in
the
cities
of
the
Kenites,
030:030
And
to
them
which
were
in
Hormah,
and
to
them
which
were
in
Chorashan,
and
to
them
which
were
in
Athach,
030:031
And
to
them
which
were
in
Hebron,
and
to
all
the
places
where
David
himself
and
his
men
were
wont
to
haunt.
031:001
Now
the
Philistines
fought
against
Israel:
and
the
men
of
Israel
fled
from
before
the
Philistines,
and
fell
down
slain
in
mount
Gilboa.
031:002
And
the
Philistines
followed
hard
upon
Saul
and
upon
his
sons;
and
the
Philistines
slew
Jonathan,
and
Abinadab,
and
Melchishua,
Saul's
sons.
031:003
And
the
battle
went
sore
against
Saul,
and
the
archers
hit
him;
and
he
was
sore
wounded
of
the
archers.
031:004
Then
said
Saul
unto
his
armourbearer,
Draw
thy
sword,
and
thrust
me
through
therewith;
lest
these
uncircumcised
come
and
thrust
me
through,
and
abuse
me.
But
his
armourbearer
would
not;
for
he
was
sore
afraid.
Therefore
Saul
took
a
sword,
and
fell
upon
it.
031:005
And
when
his
armourbearer
saw
that
Saul
was
dead,
he
fell
likewise
upon
his
sword,
and
died
with
him.
031:006
So
Saul
died,
and
his
three
sons,
and
his
armourbearer,
and
all
his
men,
that
same
day
together.
031:007
And
when
the
men
of
Israel
that
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley,
and
they
that
were
on
the
other
side
Jordan,
saw
that
the
men
of
Israel
fled,
and
that
Saul
and
his
sons
were
dead,
they
forsook
the
cities,
and
fled;
and
the
Philistines
came
and
dwelt
in
them.
031:008
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
when
the
Philistines
came
to
strip
the
slain,
that
they
found
Saul
and
his
three
sons
fallen
in
mount
Gilboa.
031:009
And
they
cut
off
his
head,
and
stripped
off
his
armour,
and
sent
into
the
land
of
the
Philistines
round
about,
to
publish
it
in
the
house
of
their
idols,
and
among
the
people.
031:010
And
they
put
his
armour
in
the
house
of
Ashtaroth:
and
they
fastened
his
body
to
the
wall
of
Bethshan.
031:011
And
when
the
inhabitants
of
Jabeshgilead
heard
of
that
which
the
Philistines
had
done
to
Saul;
031:012
All
the
valiant
men
arose,
and
went
all
night,
and
took
the
body
of
Saul
and
the
bodies
of
his
sons
from
the
wall
of
Bethshan,
and
came
to
Jabesh,
and
burnt
them
there.
031:013
And
they
took
their
bones,
and
buried
them
under
a
tree
at
Jabesh,
and
fasted
seven
days.
Book
10	2
Samuel
001:001
Now
it
came
to
pass
after
the
death
of
Saul,
when
David
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
Amalekites,
and
David
had
abode
two
days
in
Ziklag;
001:002
It
came
even
to
pass
on
the
third
day,
that,
behold,
a
man
came
out
of
the
camp
from
Saul
with
his
clothes
rent,
and
earth
upon
his
head:
and
so
it
was,
when
he
came
to
David,
that
he
fell
to
the
earth,
and
did
obeisance.
001:003
And
David
said
unto
him,
From
whence
comest
thou?
And
he
said
unto
him,
Out
of
the
camp
of
Israel
am
I
escaped.
001:004
And
David
said
unto
him,
How
went
the
matter?
I
pray
thee,
tell
me.
And
he
answered,
That
the
people
are
fled
from
the
battle,
and
many
of
the
people
also
are
fallen
and
dead;
and
Saul
and
Jonathan
his
son
are
dead
also.
001:005
And
David
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
him,
How
knowest
thou
that
Saul
and
Jonathan
his
son
be
dead?
001:006
And
the
young
man
that
told
him
said,
As
I
happened
by
chance
upon
mount
Gilboa,
behold,
Saul
leaned
upon
his
spear;
and,
lo,
the
chariots
and
horsemen
followed
hard
after
him.
001:007
And
when
he
looked
behind
him,
he
saw
me,
and
called
unto
me.
And
I
answered,
Here
am
I.
001:008
And
he
said
unto
me,
Who
art
thou?
And
I
answered
him,
I
am
an
Amalekite.
001:009
He
said
unto
me
again,
Stand,
I
pray
thee,
upon
me,
and
slay
me:
for
anguish
is
come
upon
me,
because
my
life
is
yet
whole
in
me.
001:010
So
I
stood
upon
him,
and
slew
him,
because
I
was
sure
that
he
could
not
live
after
that
he
was
fallen:
and
I
took
the
crown
that
was
upon
his
head,
and
the
bracelet
that
was
on
his
arm,
and
have
brought
them
hither
unto
my
lord.
001:011
Then
David
took
hold
on
his
clothes,
and
rent
them;
and
likewise
all
the
men
that
were
with
him:
001:012
And
they
mourned,
and
wept,
and
fasted
until
even,
for
Saul,
and
for
Jonathan
his
son,
and
for
the
people
of
the
LORD,
and
for
the
house
of
Israel;
because
they
were
fallen
by
the
sword.
001:013
And
David
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
him,
Whence
art
thou?
And
he
answered,
I
am
the
son
of
a
stranger,
an
Amalekite.
001:014
And
David
said
unto
him,
How
wast
thou
not
afraid
to
stretch
forth
thine
hand
to
destroy
the
LORD's
anointed?
001:015
And
David
called
one
of
the
young
men,
and
said,
Go
near,
and
fall
upon
him.
And
he
smote
him
that
he
died.
001:016
And
David
said
unto
him,
Thy
blood
be
upon
thy
head;
for
thy
mouth
hath
testified
against
thee,
saying,
I
have
slain
the
LORD's
anointed.
001:017
And
David
lamented
with
this
lamentation
over
Saul
and
over
Jonathan
his
son:
001:018
(Also
he
bade
them
teach
the
children
of
Judah
the
use
of
the
bow:
behold,
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
Jasher.)
001:019
The
beauty
of
Israel
is
slain
upon
thy
high
places:
how
are
the
mighty
fallen!
001:020
Tell
it
not
in
Gath,
publish
it
not
in
the
streets
of
Askelon;
lest
the
daughters
of
the
Philistines
rejoice,
lest
the
daughters
of
the
uncircumcised
triumph.
001:021
Ye
mountains
of
Gilboa,
let
there
be
no
dew,
neither
let
there
be
rain,
upon
you,
nor
fields
of
offerings:
for
there
the
shield
of
the
mighty
is
vilely
cast
away,
the
shield
of
Saul,
as
though
he
had
not
been
anointed
with
oil.
001:022
From
the
blood
of
the
slain,
from
the
fat
of
the
mighty,
the
bow
of
Jonathan
turned
not
back,
and
the
sword
of
Saul
returned
not
empty.
001:023
Saul
and
Jonathan
were
lovely
and
pleasant
in
their
lives,
and
in
their
death
they
were
not
divided:
they
were
swifter
than
eagles,
they
were
stronger
than
lions.
001:024
Ye
daughters
of
Israel,
weep
over
Saul,
who
clothed
you
in
scarlet,
with
other
delights,
who
put
on
ornaments
of
gold
upon
your
apparel.
001:025
How
are
the
mighty
fallen
in
the
midst
of
the
battle!
O
Jonathan,
thou
wast
slain
in
thine
high
places.
001:026
I
am
distressed
for
thee,
my
brother
Jonathan:
very
pleasant
hast
thou
been
unto
me:
thy
love
to
me
was
wonderful,
passing
the
love
of
women.
001:027
How
are
the
mighty
fallen,
and
the
weapons
of
war
perished!
002:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
David
enquired
of
the
LORD,
saying,
Shall
I
go
up
into
any
of
the
cities
of
Judah?
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Go
up.
And
David
said,
Whither
shall
I
go
up?
And
he
said,
Unto
Hebron.
002:002
So
David
went
up
thither,
and
his
two
wives
also,
Ahinoam
the
Jezreelitess,
and
Abigail
Nabal's
wife
the
Carmelite.
002:003
And
his
men
that
were
with
him
did
David
bring
up,
every
man
with
his
household:
and
they
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
Hebron.
002:004
And
the
men
of
Judah
came,
and
there
they
anointed
David
king
over
the
house
of
Judah.
And
they
told
David,
saying,
That
the
men
of
Jabeshgilead
were
they
that
buried
Saul.
002:005
And
David
sent
messengers
unto
the
men
of
Jabeshgilead,
and
said
unto
them,
Blessed
be
ye
of
the
LORD,
that
ye
have
shewed
this
kindness
unto
your
lord,
even
unto
Saul,
and
have
buried
him.
002:006
And
now
the
LORD
shew
kindness
and
truth
unto
you:
and
I
also
will
requite
you
this
kindness,
because
ye
have
done
this
thing.
002:007
Therefore
now
let
your
hands
be
strengthened,
and
be
ye
valiant:
for
your
master
Saul
is
dead,
and
also
the
house
of
Judah
have
anointed
me
king
over
them.
002:008
But
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
captain
of
Saul's
host,
took
Ishbosheth
the
son
of
Saul,
and
brought
him
over
to
Mahanaim;
002:009
And
made
him
king
over
Gilead,
and
over
the
Ashurites,
and
over
Jezreel,
and
over
Ephraim,
and
over
Benjamin,
and
over
all
Israel.
002:010
Ishbosheth
Saul's
son
was
forty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
over
Israel,
and
reigned
two
years.
But
the
house
of
Judah
followed
David.
002:011
And
the
time
that
David
was
king
in
Hebron
over
the
house
of
Judah
was
seven
years
and
six
months.
002:012
And
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
and
the
servants
of
Ishbosheth
the
son
of
Saul,
went
out
from
Mahanaim
to
Gibeon.
002:013
And
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
and
the
servants
of
David,
went
out,
and
met
together
by
the
pool
of
Gibeon:
and
they
sat
down,
the
one
on
the
one
side
of
the
pool,
and
the
other
on
the
other
side
of
the
pool.
002:014
And
Abner
said
to
Joab,
Let
the
young
men
now
arise,
and
play
before
us.
And
Joab
said,
Let
them
arise.
002:015
Then
there
arose
and
went
over
by
number
twelve
of
Benjamin,
which
pertained
to
Ishbosheth
the
son
of
Saul,
and
twelve
of
the
servants
of
David.
002:016
And
they
caught
every
one
his
fellow
by
the
head,
and
thrust
his
sword
in
his
fellow's
side;
so
they
fell
down
together:
wherefore
that
place
was
called
Helkathhazzurim,
which
is
in
Gibeon.
002:017
And
there
was
a
very
sore
battle
that
day;
and
Abner
was
beaten,
and
the
men
of
Israel,
before
the
servants
of
David.
002:018
And
there
were
three
sons
of
Zeruiah
there,
Joab,
and
Abishai,
and
Asahel:
and
Asahel
was
as
light
of
foot
as
a
wild
roe.
002:019
And
Asahel
pursued
after
Abner;
and
in
going
he
turned
not
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
from
following
Abner.
002:020
Then
Abner
looked
behind
him,
and
said,
Art
thou
Asahel?
And
he
answered,
I
am.
002:021
And
Abner
said
to
him,
Turn
thee
aside
to
thy
right
hand
or
to
thy
left,
and
lay
thee
hold
on
one
of
the
young
men,
and
take
thee
his
armour.
But
Asahel
would
not
turn
aside
from
following
of
him.
002:022
And
Abner
said
again
to
Asahel,
Turn
thee
aside
from
following
me:
wherefore
should
I
smite
thee
to
the
ground?
how
then
should
I
hold
up
my
face
to
Joab
thy
brother?
002:023
Howbeit
he
refused
to
turn
aside:
wherefore
Abner
with
the
hinder
end
of
the
spear
smote
him
under
the
fifth
rib,
that
the
spear
came
out
behind
him;
and
he
fell
down
there,
and
died
in
the
same
place:
and
it
came
to
pass,
that
as
many
as
came
to
the
place
where
Asahel
fell
down
and
died
stood
still.
002:024
Joab
also
and
Abishai
pursued
after
Abner:
and
the
sun
went
down
when
they
were
come
to
the
hill
of
Ammah,
that
lieth
before
Giah
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
Gibeon.
002:025
And
the
children
of
Benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
after
Abner,
and
became
one
troop,
and
stood
on
the
top
of
an
hill.
002:026
Then
Abner
called
to
Joab,
and
said,
Shall
the
sword
devour
for
ever?
knowest
thou
not
that
it
will
be
bitterness
in
the
latter
end?
how
long
shall
it
be
then,
ere
thou
bid
the
people
return
from
following
their
brethren?
002:027
And
Joab
said,
As
God
liveth,
unless
thou
hadst
spoken,
surely
then
in
the
morning
the
people
had
gone
up
every
one
from
following
his
brother.
002:028
So
Joab
blew
a
trumpet,
and
all
the
people
stood
still,
and
pursued
after
Israel
no
more,
neither
fought
they
any
more.
002:029
And
Abner
and
his
men
walked
all
that
night
through
the
plain,
and
passed
over
Jordan,
and
went
through
all
Bithron,
and
they
came
to
Mahanaim.
002:030
And
Joab
returned
from
following
Abner:
and
when
he
had
gathered
all
the
people
together,
there
lacked
of
David's
servants
nineteen
men
and
Asahel.
002:031
But
the
servants
of
David
had
smitten
of
Benjamin,
and
of
Abner's
men,
so
that
three
hundred
and
threescore
men
died.
002:032
And
they
took
up
Asahel,
and
buried
him
in
the
sepulchre
of
his
father,
which
was
in
Bethlehem.
And
Joab
and
his
men
went
all
night,
and
they
came
to
Hebron
at
break
of
day.
003:001
Now
there
was
long
war
between
the
house
of
Saul
and
the
house
of
David:
but
David
waxed
stronger
and
stronger,
and
the
house
of
Saul
waxed
weaker
and
weaker.
003:002
And
unto
David
were
sons
born
in
Hebron:
and
his
firstborn
was
Amnon,
of
Ahinoam
the
Jezreelitess;
003:003
And
his
second,
Chileab,
of
Abigail
the
wife
of
Nabal
the
Carmelite;
and
the
third,
Absalom
the
son
of
Maacah
the
daughter
of
Talmai
king
of
Geshur;
003:004
And
the
fourth,
Adonijah
the
son
of
Haggith;
and
the
fifth,
Shephatiah
the
son
of
Abital;
003:005
And
the
sixth,
Ithream,
by
Eglah
David's
wife.
These
were
born
to
David
in
Hebron.
003:006
And
it
came
to
pass,
while
there
was
war
between
the
house
of
Saul
and
the
house
of
David,
that
Abner
made
himself
strong
for
the
house
of
Saul.
003:007
And
Saul
had
a
concubine,
whose
name
was
Rizpah,
the
daughter
of
Aiah:
and
Ishbosheth
said
to
Abner,
Wherefore
hast
thou
gone
in
unto
my
father's
concubine?
003:008
Then
was
Abner
very
wroth
for
the
words
of
Ishbosheth,
and
said,
Am
I
a
dog's
head,
which
against
Judah
do
shew
kindness
this
day
unto
the
house
of
Saul
thy
father,
to
his
brethren,
and
to
his
friends,
and
have
not
delivered
thee
into
the
hand
of
David,
that
thou
chargest
me
to
day
with
a
fault
concerning
this
woman?
003:009
So
do
God
to
Abner,
and
more
also,
except,
as
the
LORD
hath
sworn
to
David,
even
so
I
do
to
him;
003:010
To
translate
the
kingdom
from
the
house
of
Saul,
and
to
set
up
the
throne
of
David
over
Israel
and
over
Judah,
from
Dan
even
to
Beersheba.
003:011
And
he
could
not
answer
Abner
a
word
again,
because
he
feared
him.
003:012
And
Abner
sent
messengers
to
David
on
his
behalf,
saying,
Whose
is
the
land?
saying
also,
Make
thy
league
with
me,
and,
behold,
my
hand
shall
be
with
thee,
to
bring
about
all
Israel
unto
thee.
003:013
And
he
said,
Well;
I
will
make
a
league
with
thee:
but
one
thing
I
require
of
thee,
that
is,
Thou
shalt
not
see
my
face,
except
thou
first
bring
Michal
Saul's
daughter,
when
thou
comest
to
see
my
face.
003:014
And
David
sent
messengers
to
Ishbosheth
Saul's
son,
saying,
Deliver
me
my
wife
Michal,
which
I
espoused
to
me
for
an
hundred
foreskins
of
the
Philistines.
003:015
And
Ishbosheth
sent,
and
took
her
from
her
husband,
even
from
Phaltiel
the
son
of
Laish.
003:016
And
her
husband
went
with
her
along
weeping
behind
her
to
Bahurim.
Then
said
Abner
unto
him,
Go,
return.
And
he
returned.
003:017
And
Abner
had
communication
with
the
elders
of
Israel,
saying,
Ye
sought
for
David
in
times
past
to
be
king
over
you:
003:018
Now
then
do
it:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken
of
David,
saying,
By
the
hand
of
my
servant
David
I
will
save
my
people
Israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines,
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
their
enemies.
003:019
And
Abner
also
spake
in
the
ears
of
Benjamin:
and
Abner
went
also
to
speak
in
the
ears
of
David
in
Hebron
all
that
seemed
good
to
Israel,
and
that
seemed
good
to
the
whole
house
of
Benjamin.
003:020
So
Abner
came
to
David
to
Hebron,
and
twenty
men
with
him.
And
David
made
Abner
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
a
feast.
003:021
And
Abner
said
unto
David,
I
will
arise
and
go,
and
will
gather
all
Israel
unto
my
lord
the
king,
that
they
may
make
a
league
with
thee,
and
that
thou
mayest
reign
over
all
that
thine
heart
desireth.
And
David
sent
Abner
away;
and
he
went
in
peace.
003:022
And,
behold,
the
servants
of
David
and
Joab
came
from
pursuing
a
troop,
and
brought
in
a
great
spoil
with
them:
but
Abner
was
not
with
David
in
Hebron;
for
he
had
sent
him
away,
and
he
was
gone
in
peace.
003:023
When
Joab
and
all
the
host
that
was
with
him
were
come,
they
told
Joab,
saying,
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
came
to
the
king,
and
he
hath
sent
him
away,
and
he
is
gone
in
peace.
003:024
Then
Joab
came
to
the
king,
and
said,
What
hast
thou
done?
behold,
Abner
came
unto
thee;
why
is
it
that
thou
hast
sent
him
away,
and
he
is
quite
gone?
003:025
Thou
knowest
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
that
he
came
to
deceive
thee,
and
to
know
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in,
and
to
know
all
that
thou
doest.
003:026
And
when
Joab
was
come
out
from
David,
he
sent
messengers
after
Abner,
which
brought
him
again
from
the
well
of
Sirah:
but
David
knew
it
not.
003:027
And
when
Abner
was
returned
to
Hebron,
Joab
took
him
aside
in
the
gate
to
speak
with
him
quietly,
and
smote
him
there
under
the
fifth
rib,
that
he
died,
for
the
blood
of
Asahel
his
brother.
003:028
And
afterward
when
David
heard
it,
he
said,
I
and
my
kingdom
are
guiltless
before
the
LORD
for
ever
from
the
blood
of
Abner
the
son
of
Ner:
003:029
Let
it
rest
on
the
head
of
Joab,
and
on
all
his
father's
house;
and
let
there
not
fail
from
the
house
of
Joab
one
that
hath
an
issue,
or
that
is
a
leper,
or
that
leaneth
on
a
staff,
or
that
falleth
on
the
sword,
or
that
lacketh
bread.
003:030
So
Joab,
and
Abishai
his
brother
slew
Abner,
because
he
had
slain
their
brother
Asahel
at
Gibeon
in
the
battle.
003:031
And
David
said
to
Joab,
and
to
all
the
people
that
were
with
him,
Rend
your
clothes,
and
gird
you
with
sackcloth,
and
mourn
before
Abner.
And
king
David
himself
followed
the
bier.
003:032
And
they
buried
Abner
in
Hebron:
and
the
king
lifted
up
his
voice,
and
wept
at
the
grave
of
Abner;
and
all
the
people
wept.
003:033
And
the
king
lamented
over
Abner,
and
said,
Died
Abner
as
a
fool
dieth?
003:034
Thy
hands
were
not
bound,
nor
thy
feet
put
into
fetters:
as
a
man
falleth
before
wicked
men,
so
fellest
thou.
And
all
the
people
wept
again
over
him.
003:035
And
when
all
the
people
came
to
cause
David
to
eat
meat
while
it
was
yet
day,
David
sware,
saying,
So
do
God
to
me,
and
more
also,
if
I
taste
bread,
or
ought
else,
till
the
sun
be
down.
003:036
And
all
the
people
took
notice
of
it,
and
it
pleased
them:
as
whatsoever
the
king
did
pleased
all
the
people.
003:037
For
all
the
people
and
all
Israel
understood
that
day
that
it
was
not
of
the
king
to
slay
Abner
the
son
of
Ner.
003:038
And
the
king
said
unto
his
servants,
Know
ye
not
that
there
is
a
prince
and
a
great
man
fallen
this
day
in
Israel?
003:039
And
I
am
this
day
weak,
though
anointed
king;
and
these
men
the
sons
of
Zeruiah
be
too
hard
for
me:
the
LORD
shall
reward
the
doer
of
evil
according
to
his
wickedness.
004:001
And
when
Saul's
son
heard
that
Abner
was
dead
in
Hebron,
his
hands
were
feeble,
and
all
the
Israelites
were
troubled.
004:002
And
Saul's
son
had
two
men
that
were
captains
of
bands:
the
name
of
the
one
was
Baanah,
and
the
name
of
the
other
Rechab,
the
sons
of
Rimmon
a
Beerothite,
of
the
children
of
Benjamin:
(for
Beeroth
also
was
reckoned
to
Benjamin.
004:003
And
the
Beerothites
fled
to
Gittaim,
and
were
sojourners
there
until
this
day.)
004:004
And
Jonathan,
Saul's
son,
had
a
son
that
was
lame
of
his
feet.
He
was
five
years
old
when
the
tidings
came
of
Saul
and
Jonathan
out
of
Jezreel,
and
his
nurse
took
him
up,
and
fled:
and
it
came
to
pass,
as
she
made
haste
to
flee,
that
he
fell,
and
became
lame.
And
his
name
was
Mephibosheth.
004:005
And
the
sons
of
Rimmon
the
Beerothite,
Rechab
and
Baanah,
went,
and
came
about
the
heat
of
the
day
to
the
house
of
Ishbosheth,
who
lay
on
a
bed
at
noon.
004:006
And
they
came
thither
into
the
midst
of
the
house,
as
though
they
would
have
fetched
wheat;
and
