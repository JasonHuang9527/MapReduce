they
smote
him
under
the
fifth
rib:
and
Rechab
and
Baanah
his
brother
escaped.
004:007
For
when
they
came
into
the
house,
he
lay
on
his
bed
in
his
bedchamber,
and
they
smote
him,
and
slew
him,
and
beheaded
him,
and
took
his
head,
and
gat
them
away
through
the
plain
all
night.
004:008
And
they
brought
the
head
of
Ishbosheth
unto
David
to
Hebron,
and
said
to
the
king,
Behold
the
head
of
Ishbosheth
the
son
of
Saul
thine
enemy,
which
sought
thy
life;
and
the
LORD
hath
avenged
my
lord
the
king
this
day
of
Saul,
and
of
his
seed.
004:009
And
David
answered
Rechab
and
Baanah
his
brother,
the
sons
of
Rimmon
the
Beerothite,
and
said
unto
them,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
who
hath
redeemed
my
soul
out
of
all
adversity,
004:010
When
one
told
me,
saying,
Behold,
Saul
is
dead,
thinking
to
have
brought
good
tidings,
I
took
hold
of
him,
and
slew
him
in
Ziklag,
who
thought
that
I
would
have
given
him
a
reward
for
his
tidings:
004:011
How
much
more,
when
wicked
men
have
slain
a
righteous
person
in
his
own
house
upon
his
bed?
shall
I
not
therefore
now
require
his
blood
of
your
hand,
and
take
you
away
from
the
earth?
004:012
And
David
commanded
his
young
men,
and
they
slew
them,
and
cut
off
their
hands
and
their
feet,
and
hanged
them
up
over
the
pool
in
Hebron.
But
they
took
the
head
of
Ishbosheth,
and
buried
it
in
the
sepulchre
of
Abner
in
Hebron.
005:001
Then
came
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
David
unto
Hebron,
and
spake,
saying,
Behold,
we
are
thy
bone
and
thy
flesh.
005:002
Also
in
time
past,
when
Saul
was
king
over
us,
thou
wast
he
that
leddest
out
and
broughtest
in
Israel:
and
the
LORD
said
to
thee,
Thou
shalt
feed
my
people
Israel,
and
thou
shalt
be
a
captain
over
Israel.
005:003
So
all
the
elders
of
Israel
came
to
the
king
to
Hebron;
and
king
David
made
a
league
with
them
in
Hebron
before
the
LORD:
and
they
anointed
David
king
over
Israel.
005:004
David
was
thirty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
forty
years.
005:005
In
Hebron
he
reigned
over
Judah
seven
years
and
six
months:
and
in
Jerusalem
he
reigned
thirty
and
three
years
over
all
Israel
and
Judah.
005:006
And
the
king
and
his
men
went
to
Jerusalem
unto
the
Jebusites,
the
inhabitants
of
the
land:
which
spake
unto
David,
saying,
Except
thou
take
away
the
blind
and
the
lame,
thou
shalt
not
come
in
hither:
thinking,
David
cannot
come
in
hither.
005:007
Nevertheless
David
took
the
strong
hold
of
Zion:
the
same
is
the
city
of
David.
005:008
And
David
said
on
that
day,
Whosoever
getteth
up
to
the
gutter,
and
smiteth
the
Jebusites,
and
the
lame
and
the
blind
that
are
hated
of
David's
soul,
he
shall
be
chief
and
captain.
Wherefore
they
said,
The
blind
and
the
lame
shall
not
come
into
the
house.
005:009
So
David
dwelt
in
the
fort,
and
called
it
the
city
of
David.
And
David
built
round
about
from
Millo
and
inward.
005:010
And
David
went
on,
and
grew
great,
and
the
LORD
God
of
hosts
was
with
him.
005:011
And
Hiram
king
of
Tyre
sent
messengers
to
David,
and
cedar
trees,
and
carpenters,
and
masons:
and
they
built
David
an
house.
005:012
And
David
perceived
that
the
LORD
had
established
him
king
over
Israel,
and
that
he
had
exalted
his
kingdom
for
his
people
Israel's
sake.
005:013
And
David
took
him
more
concubines
and
wives
out
of
Jerusalem,
after
he
was
come
from
Hebron:
and
there
were
yet
sons
and
daughters
born
to
David.
005:014
And
these
be
the
names
of
those
that
were
born
unto
him
in
Jerusalem;
Shammuah,
and
Shobab,
and
Nathan,
and
Solomon,
005:015
Ibhar
also,
and
Elishua,
and
Nepheg,
and
Japhia,
005:016
And
Elishama,
and
Eliada,
and
Eliphalet.
005:017
But
when
the
Philistines
heard
that
they
had
anointed
David
king
over
Israel,
all
the
Philistines
came
up
to
seek
David;
and
David
heard
of
it,
and
went
down
to
the
hold.
005:018
The
Philistines
also
came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
005:019
And
David
enquired
of
the
LORD,
saying,
Shall
I
go
up
to
the
Philistines?
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
hand?
And
the
LORD
said
unto
David,
Go
up:
for
I
will
doubtless
deliver
the
Philistines
into
thine
hand.
005:020
And
David
came
to
Baalperazim,
and
David
smote
them
there,
and
said,
The
LORD
hath
broken
forth
upon
mine
enemies
before
me,
as
the
breach
of
waters.
Therefore
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
Baalperazim.
005:021
And
there
they
left
their
images,
and
David
and
his
men
burned
them.
005:022
And
the
Philistines
came
up
yet
again,
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
005:023
And
when
David
enquired
of
the
LORD,
he
said,
Thou
shalt
not
go
up;
but
fetch
a
compass
behind
them,
and
come
upon
them
over
against
the
mulberry
trees.
005:024
And
let
it
be,
when
thou
hearest
the
sound
of
a
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
trees,
that
then
thou
shalt
bestir
thyself:
for
then
shall
the
LORD
go
out
before
thee,
to
smite
the
host
of
the
Philistines.
005:025
And
David
did
so,
as
the
LORD
had
commanded
him;
and
smote
the
Philistines
from
Geba
until
thou
come
to
Gazer.
006:001
Again,
David
gathered
together
all
the
chosen
men
of
Israel,
thirty
thousand.
006:002
And
David
arose,
and
went
with
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
Baale
of
Judah,
to
bring
up
from
thence
the
ark
of
God,
whose
name
is
called
by
the
name
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
that
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims.
006:003
And
they
set
the
ark
of
God
upon
a
new
cart,
and
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
Abinadab
that
was
in
Gibeah:
and
Uzzah
and
Ahio,
the
sons
of
Abinadab,
drave
the
new
cart.
006:004
And
they
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
Abinadab
which
was
at
Gibeah,
accompanying
the
ark
of
God:
and
Ahio
went
before
the
ark.
006:005
And
David
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
played
before
the
LORD
on
all
manner
of
instruments
made
of
fir
wood,
even
on
harps,
and
on
psalteries,
and
on
timbrels,
and
on
cornets,
and
on
cymbals.
006:006
And
when
they
came
to
Nachon's
threshingfloor,
Uzzah
put
forth
his
hand
to
the
ark
of
God,
and
took
hold
of
it;
for
the
oxen
shook
it.
006:007
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Uzzah;
and
God
smote
him
there
for
his
error;
and
there
he
died
by
the
ark
of
God.
006:008
And
David
was
displeased,
because
the
LORD
had
made
a
breach
upon
Uzzah:
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
Perezuzzah
to
this
day.
006:009
And
David
was
afraid
of
the
LORD
that
day,
and
said,
How
shall
the
ark
of
the
LORD
come
to
me?
006:010
So
David
would
not
remove
the
ark
of
the
LORD
unto
him
into
the
city
of
David:
but
David
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
Obededom
the
Gittite.
006:011
And
the
ark
of
the
LORD
continued
in
the
house
of
Obededom
the
Gittite
three
months:
and
the
LORD
blessed
Obededom,
and
all
his
household.
006:012
And
it
was
told
king
David,
saying,
The
LORD
hath
blessed
the
house
of
Obededom,
and
all
that
pertaineth
unto
him,
because
of
the
ark
of
God.
So
David
went
and
brought
up
the
ark
of
God
from
the
house
of
Obededom
into
the
city
of
David
with
gladness.
006:013
And
it
was
so,
that
when
they
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
LORD
had
gone
six
paces,
he
sacrificed
oxen
and
fatlings.
006:014
And
David
danced
before
the
LORD
with
all
his
might;
and
David
was
girded
with
a
linen
ephod.
006:015
So
David
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD
with
shouting,
and
with
the
sound
of
the
trumpet.
006:016
And
as
the
ark
of
the
LORD
came
into
the
city
of
David,
Michal
Saul's
daughter
looked
through
a
window,
and
saw
king
David
leaping
and
dancing
before
the
LORD;
and
she
despised
him
in
her
heart.
006:017
And
they
brought
in
the
ark
of
the
LORD,
and
set
it
in
his
place,
in
the
midst
of
the
tabernacle
that
David
had
pitched
for
it:
and
David
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
before
the
LORD.
006:018
And
as
soon
as
David
had
made
an
end
of
offering
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings,
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
of
hosts.
006:019
And
he
dealt
among
all
the
people,
even
among
the
whole
multitude
of
Israel,
as
well
to
the
women
as
men,
to
every
one
a
cake
of
bread,
and
a
good
piece
of
flesh,
and
a
flagon
of
wine.
So
all
the
people
departed
every
one
to
his
house.
006:020
Then
David
returned
to
bless
his
household.
And
Michal
the
daughter
of
Saul
came
out
to
meet
David,
and
said,
How
glorious
was
the
king
of
Israel
to
day,
who
uncovered
himself
to
day
in
the
eyes
of
the
handmaids
of
his
servants,
as
one
of
the
vain
fellows
shamelessly
uncovereth
himself!
006:021
And
David
said
unto
Michal,
It
was
before
the
LORD,
which
chose
me
before
thy
father,
and
before
all
his
house,
to
appoint
me
ruler
over
the
people
of
the
LORD,
over
Israel:
therefore
will
I
play
before
the
LORD.
006:022
And
I
will
yet
be
more
vile
than
thus,
and
will
be
base
in
mine
own
sight:
and
of
the
maidservants
which
thou
hast
spoken
of,
of
them
shall
I
be
had
in
honour.
006:023
Therefore
Michal
the
daughter
of
Saul
had
no
child
unto
the
day
of
her
death.
007:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
king
sat
in
his
house,
and
the
LORD
had
given
him
rest
round
about
from
all
his
enemies;
007:002
That
the
king
said
unto
Nathan
the
prophet,
See
now,
I
dwell
in
an
house
of
cedar,
but
the
ark
of
God
dwelleth
within
curtains.
007:003
And
Nathan
said
to
the
king,
Go,
do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart;
for
the
LORD
is
with
thee.
007:004
And
it
came
to
pass
that
night,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Nathan,
saying,
007:005
Go
and
tell
my
servant
David,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Shalt
thou
build
me
an
house
for
me
to
dwell
in?
007:006
Whereas
I
have
not
dwelt
in
any
house
since
the
time
that
I
brought
up
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
Egypt,
even
to
this
day,
but
have
walked
in
a
tent
and
in
a
tabernacle.
007:007
In
all
the
places
wherein
I
have
walked
with
all
the
children
of
Israel
spake
I
a
word
with
any
of
the
tribes
of
Israel,
whom
I
commanded
to
feed
my
people
Israel,
saying,
Why
build
ye
not
me
an
house
of
cedar?
007:008
Now
therefore
so
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
servant
David,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
I
took
thee
from
the
sheepcote,
from
following
the
sheep,
to
be
ruler
over
my
people,
over
Israel:
007:009
And
I
was
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
wentest,
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
out
of
thy
sight,
and
have
made
thee
a
great
name,
like
unto
the
name
of
the
great
men
that
are
in
the
earth.
007:010
Moreover
I
will
appoint
a
place
for
my
people
Israel,
and
will
plant
them,
that
they
may
dwell
in
a
place
of
their
own,
and
move
no
more;
neither
shall
the
children
of
wickedness
afflict
them
any
more,
as
beforetime,
007:011
And
as
since
the
time
that
I
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
Israel,
and
have
caused
thee
to
rest
from
all
thine
enemies.
Also
the
LORD
telleth
thee
that
he
will
make
thee
an
house.
007:012
And
when
thy
days
be
fulfilled,
and
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers,
I
will
set
up
thy
seed
after
thee,
which
shall
proceed
out
of
thy
bowels,
and
I
will
establish
his
kingdom.
007:013
He
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name,
and
I
will
stablish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
for
ever.
007:014
I
will
be
his
father,
and
he
shall
be
my
son.
If
he
commit
iniquity,
I
will
chasten
him
with
the
rod
of
men,
and
with
the
stripes
of
the
children
of
men:
007:015
But
my
mercy
shall
not
depart
away
from
him,
as
I
took
it
from
Saul,
whom
I
put
away
before
thee.
007:016
And
thine
house
and
thy
kingdom
shall
be
established
for
ever
before
thee:
thy
throne
shall
be
established
for
ever.
007:017
According
to
all
these
words,
and
according
to
all
this
vision,
so
did
Nathan
speak
unto
David.
007:018
Then
went
king
David
in,
and
sat
before
the
LORD,
and
he
said,
Who
am
I,
O
Lord
GOD?
and
what
is
my
house,
that
thou
hast
brought
me
hitherto?
007:019
And
this
was
yet
a
small
thing
in
thy
sight,
O
Lord
GOD;
but
thou
hast
spoken
also
of
thy
servant's
house
for
a
great
while
to
come.
And
is
this
the
manner
of
man,
O
Lord
GOD?
007:020
And
what
can
David
say
more
unto
thee?
for
thou,
Lord
GOD,
knowest
thy
servant.
007:021
For
thy
word's
sake,
and
according
to
thine
own
heart,
hast
thou
done
all
these
great
things,
to
make
thy
servant
know
them.
007:022
Wherefore
thou
art
great,
O
LORD
God:
for
there
is
none
like
thee,
neither
is
there
any
God
beside
thee,
according
to
all
that
we
have
heard
with
our
ears.
007:023
And
what
one
nation
in
the
earth
is
like
thy
people,
even
like
Israel,
whom
God
went
to
redeem
for
a
people
to
himself,
and
to
make
him
a
name,
and
to
do
for
you
great
things
and
terrible,
for
thy
land,
before
thy
people,
which
thou
redeemedst
to
thee
from
Egypt,
from
the
nations
and
their
gods?
007:024
For
thou
hast
confirmed
to
thyself
thy
people
Israel
to
be
a
people
unto
thee
for
ever:
and
thou,
LORD,
art
become
their
God.
007:025
And
now,
O
LORD
God,
the
word
that
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
thy
servant,
and
concerning
his
house,
establish
it
for
ever,
and
do
as
thou
hast
said.
007:026
And
let
thy
name
be
magnified
for
ever,
saying,
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
the
God
over
Israel:
and
let
the
house
of
thy
servant
David
be
established
before
thee.
007:027
For
thou,
O
LORD
of
hosts,
God
of
Israel,
hast
revealed
to
thy
servant,
saying,
I
will
build
thee
an
house:
therefore
hath
thy
servant
found
in
his
heart
to
pray
this
prayer
unto
thee.
007:028
And
now,
O
Lord
GOD,
thou
art
that
God,
and
thy
words
be
true,
and
thou
hast
promised
this
goodness
unto
thy
servant:
007:029
Therefore
now
let
it
please
thee
to
bless
the
house
of
thy
servant,
that
it
may
continue
for
ever
before
thee:
for
thou,
O
Lord
GOD,
hast
spoken
it:
and
with
thy
blessing
let
the
house
of
thy
servant
be
blessed
for
ever.
008:001
And
after
this
it
came
to
pass
that
David
smote
the
Philistines,
and
subdued
them:
and
David
took
Methegammah
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines.
008:002
And
he
smote
Moab,
and
measured
them
with
a
line,
casting
them
down
to
the
ground;
even
with
two
lines
measured
he
to
put
to
death,
and
with
one
full
line
to
keep
alive.
And
so
the
Moabites
became
David's
servants,
and
brought
gifts.
008:003
David
smote
also
Hadadezer,
the
son
of
Rehob,
king
of
Zobah,
as
he
went
to
recover
his
border
at
the
river
Euphrates.
008:004
And
David
took
from
him
a
thousand
chariots,
and
seven
hundred
horsemen,
and
twenty
thousand
footmen:
and
David
houghed
all
the
chariot
horses,
but
reserved
of
them
for
an
hundred
chariots.
008:005
And
when
the
Syrians
of
Damascus
came
to
succour
Hadadezer
king
of
Zobah,
David
slew
of
the
Syrians
two
and
twenty
thousand
men.
008:006
Then
David
put
garrisons
in
Syria
of
Damascus:
and
the
Syrians
became
servants
to
David,
and
brought
gifts.
And
the
LORD
preserved
David
whithersoever
he
went.
008:007
And
David
took
the
shields
of
gold
that
were
on
the
servants
of
Hadadezer,
and
brought
them
to
Jerusalem.
008:008
And
from
Betah,
and
from
Berothai,
cities
of
Hadadezer,
king
David
took
exceeding
much
brass.
008:009
When
Toi
king
of
Hamath
heard
that
David
had
smitten
all
the
host
of
Hadadezer,
008:010
Then
Toi
sent
Joram
his
son
unto
king
David,
to
salute
him,
and
to
bless
him,
because
he
had
fought
against
Hadadezer,
and
smitten
him:
for
Hadadezer
had
wars
with
Toi.
And
Joram
brought
with
him
vessels
of
silver,
and
vessels
of
gold,
and
vessels
of
brass:
008:011
Which
also
king
David
did
dedicate
unto
the
LORD,
with
the
silver
and
gold
that
he
had
dedicated
of
all
nations
which
he
subdued;
008:012
Of
Syria,
and
of
Moab,
and
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
of
the
Philistines,
and
of
Amalek,
and
of
the
spoil
of
Hadadezer,
son
of
Rehob,
king
of
Zobah.
008:013
And
David
gat
him
a
name
when
he
returned
from
smiting
of
the
Syrians
in
the
valley
of
salt,
being
eighteen
thousand
men.
008:014
And
he
put
garrisons
in
Edom;
throughout
all
Edom
put
he
garrisons,
and
all
they
of
Edom
became
David's
servants.
And
the
LORD
preserved
David
whithersoever
he
went.
008:015
And
David
reigned
over
all
Israel;
and
David
executed
judgment
and
justice
unto
all
his
people.
008:016
And
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
was
over
the
host;
and
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Ahilud
was
recorder;
008:017
And
Zadok
the
son
of
Ahitub,
and
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Abiathar,
were
the
priests;
and
Seraiah
was
the
scribe;
008:018
And
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
over
both
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites;
and
David's
sons
were
chief
rulers.
009:001
And
David
said,
Is
there
yet
any
that
is
left
of
the
house
of
Saul,
that
I
may
shew
him
kindness
for
Jonathan's
sake?
009:002
And
there
was
of
the
house
of
Saul
a
servant
whose
name
was
Ziba.
And
when
they
had
called
him
unto
David,
the
king
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
Ziba?
And
he
said,
Thy
servant
is
he.
009:003
And
the
king
said,
Is
there
not
yet
any
of
the
house
of
Saul,
that
I
may
shew
the
kindness
of
God
unto
him?
And
Ziba
said
unto
the
king,
Jonathan
hath
yet
a
son,
which
is
lame
on
his
feet.
009:004
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
Where
is
he?
And
Ziba
said
unto
the
king,
Behold,
he
is
in
the
house
of
Machir,
the
son
of
Ammiel,
in
Lodebar.
009:005
Then
king
David
sent,
and
fetched
him
out
of
the
house
of
Machir,
the
son
of
Ammiel,
from
Lodebar.
009:006
Now
when
Mephibosheth,
the
son
of
Jonathan,
the
son
of
Saul,
was
come
unto
David,
he
fell
on
his
face,
and
did
reverence.
And
David
said,
Mephibosheth.
And
he
answered,
Behold
thy
servant!
009:007
And
David
said
unto
him,
Fear
not:
for
I
will
surely
shew
thee
kindness
for
Jonathan
thy
father's
sake,
and
will
restore
thee
all
the
land
of
Saul
thy
father;
and
thou
shalt
eat
bread
at
my
table
continually.
009:008
And
he
bowed
himself,
and
said,
What
is
thy
servant,
that
thou
shouldest
look
upon
such
a
dead
dog
as
I
am?
009:009
Then
the
king
called
to
Ziba,
Saul's
servant,
and
said
unto
him,
I
have
given
unto
thy
master's
son
all
that
pertained
to
Saul
and
to
all
his
house.
009:010
Thou
therefore,
and
thy
sons,
and
thy
servants,
shall
till
the
land
for
him,
and
thou
shalt
bring
in
the
fruits,
that
thy
master's
son
may
have
food
to
eat:
but
Mephibosheth
thy
master's
son
shall
eat
bread
alway
at
my
table.
Now
Ziba
had
fifteen
sons
and
twenty
servants.
009:011
Then
said
Ziba
unto
the
king,
According
to
all
that
my
lord
the
king
hath
commanded
his
servant,
so
shall
thy
servant
do.
As
for
Mephibosheth,
said
the
king,
he
shall
eat
at
my
table,
as
one
of
the
king's
sons.
009:012
And
Mephibosheth
had
a
young
son,
whose
name
was
Micha.
And
all
that
dwelt
in
the
house
of
Ziba
were
servants
unto
Mephibosheth.
009:013
So
Mephibosheth
dwelt
in
Jerusalem:
for
he
did
eat
continually
at
the
king's
table;
and
was
lame
on
both
his
feet.
010:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon
died,
and
Hanun
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
010:002
Then
said
David,
I
will
shew
kindness
unto
Hanun
the
son
of
Nahash,
as
his
father
shewed
kindness
unto
me.
And
David
sent
to
comfort
him
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
for
his
father.
And
David's
servants
came
into
the
land
of
the
children
of
Ammon.
010:003
And
the
princes
of
the
children
of
Ammon
said
unto
Hanun
their
lord,
Thinkest
thou
that
David
doth
honour
thy
father,
that
he
hath
sent
comforters
unto
thee?
hath
not
David
rather
sent
his
servants
unto
thee,
to
search
the
city,
and
to
spy
it
out,
and
to
overthrow
it?
010:004
Wherefore
Hanun
took
David's
servants,
and
shaved
off
the
one
half
of
their
beards,
and
cut
off
their
garments
in
the
middle,
even
to
their
buttocks,
and
sent
them
away.
010:005
When
they
told
it
unto
David,
he
sent
to
meet
them,
because
the
men
were
greatly
ashamed:
and
the
king
said,
Tarry
at
Jericho
until
your
beards
be
grown,
and
then
return.
010:006
And
when
the
children
of
Ammon
saw
that
they
stank
before
David,
the
children
of
Ammon
sent
and
hired
the
Syrians
of
Bethrehob
and
the
Syrians
of
Zoba,
twenty
thousand
footmen,
and
of
king
Maacah
a
thousand
men,
and
of
Ishtob
twelve
thousand
men.
010:007
And
when
David
heard
of
it,
he
sent
Joab,
and
all
the
host
of
the
mighty
men.
010:008
And
the
children
of
Ammon
came
out,
and
put
the
battle
in
array
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate:
and
the
Syrians
of
Zoba,
and
of
Rehob,
and
Ishtob,
and
Maacah,
were
by
themselves
in
the
field.
010:009
When
Joab
saw
that
the
front
of
the
battle
was
against
him
before
and
behind,
he
chose
of
all
the
choice
men
of
Israel,
and
put
them
in
array
against
the
Syrians:
010:010
And
the
rest
of
the
people
he
delivered
into
the
hand
of
Abishai
his
brother,
that
he
might
put
them
in
array
against
the
children
of
Ammon.
010:011
And
he
said,
If
the
Syrians
be
too
strong
for
me,
then
thou
shalt
help
me:
but
if
the
children
of
Ammon
be
too
strong
for
thee,
then
I
will
come
and
help
thee.
010:012
Be
of
good
courage,
and
let
us
play
the
men
for
our
people,
and
for
the
cities
of
our
God:
and
the
LORD
do
that
which
seemeth
him
good.
010:013
And
Joab
drew
nigh,
and
the
people
that
were
with
him,
unto
the
battle
against
the
Syrians:
and
they
fled
before
him.
010:014
And
when
the
children
of
Ammon
saw
that
the
Syrians
were
fled,
then
fled
they
also
before
Abishai,
and
entered
into
the
city.
So
Joab
returned
from
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
came
to
Jerusalem.
010:015
And
when
the
Syrians
saw
that
they
were
smitten
before
Israel,
they
gathered
themselves
together.
010:016
And
Hadarezer
sent,
and
brought
out
the
Syrians
that
were
beyond
the
river:
and
they
came
to
Helam;
and
Shobach
the
captain
of
the
host
of
Hadarezer
went
before
them.
010:017
And
when
it
was
told
David,
he
gathered
all
Israel
together,
and
passed
over
Jordan,
and
came
to
Helam.
And
the
Syrians
set
themselves
in
array
against
David,
and
fought
with
him.
010:018
And
the
Syrians
fled
before
Israel;
and
David
slew
the
men
of
seven
hundred
chariots
of
the
Syrians,
and
forty
thousand
horsemen,
and
smote
Shobach
the
captain
of
their
host,
who
died
there.
010:019
And
when
all
the
kings
that
were
servants
to
Hadarezer
saw
that
they
were
smitten
before
Israel,
they
made
peace
with
Israel,
and
served
them.
So
the
Syrians
feared
to
help
the
children
of
Ammon
any
more.
011:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
after
the
year
was
expired,
at
the
time
when
kings
go
forth
to
battle,
that
David
sent
Joab,
and
his
servants
with
him,
and
all
Israel;
and
they
destroyed
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
besieged
Rabbah.
But
David
tarried
still
at
Jerusalem.
011:002
And
it
came
to
pass
in
an
