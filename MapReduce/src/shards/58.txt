eveningtide,
that
David
arose
from
off
his
bed,
and
walked
upon
the
roof
of
the
king's
house:
and
from
the
roof
he
saw
a
woman
washing
herself;
and
the
woman
was
very
beautiful
to
look
upon.
011:003
And
David
sent
and
enquired
after
the
woman.
And
one
said,
Is
not
this
Bathsheba,
the
daughter
of
Eliam,
the
wife
of
Uriah
the
Hittite?
011:004
And
David
sent
messengers,
and
took
her;
and
she
came
in
unto
him,
and
he
lay
with
her;
for
she
was
purified
from
her
uncleanness:
and
she
returned
unto
her
house.
011:005
And
the
woman
conceived,
and
sent
and
told
David,
and
said,
I
am
with
child.
011:006
And
David
sent
to
Joab,
saying,
Send
me
Uriah
the
Hittite.
And
Joab
sent
Uriah
to
David.
011:007
And
when
Uriah
was
come
unto
him,
David
demanded
of
him
how
Joab
did,
and
how
the
people
did,
and
how
the
war
prospered.
011:008
And
David
said
to
Uriah,
Go
down
to
thy
house,
and
wash
thy
feet.
And
Uriah
departed
out
of
the
king's
house,
and
there
followed
him
a
mess
of
meat
from
the
king.
011:009
But
Uriah
slept
at
the
door
of
the
king's
house
with
all
the
servants
of
his
lord,
and
went
not
down
to
his
house.
011:010
And
when
they
had
told
David,
saying,
Uriah
went
not
down
unto
his
house,
David
said
unto
Uriah,
Camest
thou
not
from
thy
journey?
why
then
didst
thou
not
go
down
unto
thine
house?
011:011
And
Uriah
said
unto
David,
The
ark,
and
Israel,
and
Judah,
abide
in
tents;
and
my
lord
Joab,
and
the
servants
of
my
lord,
are
encamped
in
the
open
fields;
shall
I
then
go
into
mine
house,
to
eat
and
to
drink,
and
to
lie
with
my
wife?
as
thou
livest,
and
as
thy
soul
liveth,
I
will
not
do
this
thing.
011:012
And
David
said
to
Uriah,
Tarry
here
to
day
also,
and
to
morrow
I
will
let
thee
depart.
So
Uriah
abode
in
Jerusalem
that
day,
and
the
morrow.
011:013
And
when
David
had
called
him,
he
did
eat
and
drink
before
him;
and
he
made
him
drunk:
and
at
even
he
went
out
to
lie
on
his
bed
with
the
servants
of
his
lord,
but
went
not
down
to
his
house.
011:014
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning,
that
David
wrote
a
letter
to
Joab,
and
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
Uriah.
011:015
And
he
wrote
in
the
letter,
saying,
Set
ye
Uriah
in
the
forefront
of
the
hottest
battle,
and
retire
ye
from
him,
that
he
may
be
smitten,
and
die.
011:016
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Joab
observed
the
city,
that
he
assigned
Uriah
unto
a
place
where
he
knew
that
valiant
men
were.
011:017
And
the
men
of
the
city
went
out,
and
fought
with
Joab:
and
there
fell
some
of
the
people
of
the
servants
of
David;
and
Uriah
the
Hittite
died
also.
011:018
Then
Joab
sent
and
told
David
all
the
things
concerning
the
war;
011:019
And
charged
the
messenger,
saying,
When
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
telling
the
matters
of
the
war
unto
the
king,
011:020
And
if
so
be
that
the
king's
wrath
arise,
and
he
say
unto
thee,
Wherefore
approached
ye
so
nigh
unto
the
city
when
ye
did
fight?
knew
ye
not
that
they
would
shoot
from
the
wall?
011:021
Who
smote
Abimelech
the
son
of
Jerubbesheth?
did
not
a
woman
cast
a
piece
of
a
millstone
upon
him
from
the
wall,
that
he
died
in
Thebez?
why
went
ye
nigh
the
wall?
then
say
thou,
Thy
servant
Uriah
the
Hittite
is
dead
also.
011:022
So
the
messenger
went,
and
came
and
shewed
David
all
that
Joab
had
sent
him
for.
011:023
And
the
messenger
said
unto
David,
Surely
the
men
prevailed
against
us,
and
came
out
unto
us
into
the
field,
and
we
were
upon
them
even
unto
the
entering
of
the
gate.
011:024
And
the
shooters
shot
from
off
the
wall
upon
thy
servants;
and
some
of
the
king's
servants
be
dead,
and
thy
servant
Uriah
the
Hittite
is
dead
also.
011:025
Then
David
said
unto
the
messenger,
Thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
Joab,
Let
not
this
thing
displease
thee,
for
the
sword
devoureth
one
as
well
as
another:
make
thy
battle
more
strong
against
the
city,
and
overthrow
it:
and
encourage
thou
him.
011:026
And
when
the
wife
of
Uriah
heard
that
Uriah
her
husband
was
dead,
she
mourned
for
her
husband.
011:027
And
when
the
mourning
was
past,
David
sent
and
fetched
her
to
his
house,
and
she
became
his
wife,
and
bare
him
a
son.
But
the
thing
that
David
had
done
displeased
the
LORD.
012:001
And
the
LORD
sent
Nathan
unto
David.
And
he
came
unto
him,
and
said
unto
him,
There
were
two
men
in
one
city;
the
one
rich,
and
the
other
poor.
012:002
The
rich
man
had
exceeding
many
flocks
and
herds:
012:003
But
the
poor
man
had
nothing,
save
one
little
ewe
lamb,
which
he
had
bought
and
nourished
up:
and
it
grew
up
together
with
him,
and
with
his
children;
it
did
eat
of
his
own
meat,
and
drank
of
his
own
cup,
and
lay
in
his
bosom,
and
was
unto
him
as
a
daughter.
012:004
And
there
came
a
traveller
unto
the
rich
man,
and
he
spared
to
take
of
his
own
flock
and
of
his
own
herd,
to
dress
for
the
wayfaring
man
that
was
come
unto
him;
but
took
the
poor
man's
lamb,
and
dressed
it
for
the
man
that
was
come
to
him.
012:005
And
David's
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
the
man;
and
he
said
to
Nathan,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
the
man
that
hath
done
this
thing
shall
surely
die:
012:006
And
he
shall
restore
the
lamb
fourfold,
because
he
did
this
thing,
and
because
he
had
no
pity.
012:007
And
Nathan
said
to
David,
Thou
art
the
man.
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
I
anointed
thee
king
over
Israel,
and
I
delivered
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
Saul;
012:008
And
I
gave
thee
thy
master's
house,
and
thy
master's
wives
into
thy
bosom,
and
gave
thee
the
house
of
Israel
and
of
Judah;
and
if
that
had
been
too
little,
I
would
moreover
have
given
unto
thee
such
and
such
things.
012:009
Wherefore
hast
thou
despised
the
commandment
of
the
LORD,
to
do
evil
in
his
sight?
thou
hast
killed
Uriah
the
Hittite
with
the
sword,
and
hast
taken
his
wife
to
be
thy
wife,
and
hast
slain
him
with
the
sword
of
the
children
of
Ammon.
012:010
Now
therefore
the
sword
shall
never
depart
from
thine
house;
because
thou
hast
despised
me,
and
hast
taken
the
wife
of
Uriah
the
Hittite
to
be
thy
wife.
012:011
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
raise
up
evil
against
thee
out
of
thine
own
house,
and
I
will
take
thy
wives
before
thine
eyes,
and
give
them
unto
thy
neighbour,
and
he
shall
lie
with
thy
wives
in
the
sight
of
this
sun.
012:012
For
thou
didst
it
secretly:
but
I
will
do
this
thing
before
all
Israel,
and
before
the
sun.
012:013
And
David
said
unto
Nathan,
I
have
sinned
against
the
LORD.
And
Nathan
said
unto
David,
The
LORD
also
hath
put
away
thy
sin;
thou
shalt
not
die.
012:014
Howbeit,
because
by
this
deed
thou
hast
given
great
occasion
to
the
enemies
of
the
LORD
to
blaspheme,
the
child
also
that
is
born
unto
thee
shall
surely
die.
012:015
And
Nathan
departed
unto
his
house.
And
the
LORD
struck
the
child
that
Uriah's
wife
bare
unto
David,
and
it
was
very
sick.
012:016
David
therefore
besought
God
for
the
child;
and
David
fasted,
and
went
in,
and
lay
all
night
upon
the
earth.
012:017
And
the
elders
of
his
house
arose,
and
went
to
him,
to
raise
him
up
from
the
earth:
but
he
would
not,
neither
did
he
eat
bread
with
them.
012:018
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day,
that
the
child
died.
And
the
servants
of
David
feared
to
tell
him
that
the
child
was
dead:
for
they
said,
Behold,
while
the
child
was
yet
alive,
we
spake
unto
him,
and
he
would
not
hearken
unto
our
voice:
how
will
he
then
vex
himself,
if
we
tell
him
that
the
child
is
dead?
012:019
But
when
David
saw
that
his
servants
whispered,
David
perceived
that
the
child
was
dead:
therefore
David
said
unto
his
servants,
Is
the
child
dead?
And
they
said,
He
is
dead.
012:020
Then
David
arose
from
the
earth,
and
washed,
and
anointed
himself,
and
changed
his
apparel,
and
came
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
worshipped:
then
he
came
to
his
own
house;
and
when
he
required,
they
set
bread
before
him,
and
he
did
eat.
012:021
Then
said
his
servants
unto
him,
What
thing
is
this
that
thou
hast
done?
thou
didst
fast
and
weep
for
the
child,
while
it
was
alive;
but
when
the
child
was
dead,
thou
didst
rise
and
eat
bread.
012:022
And
he
said,
While
the
child
was
yet
alive,
I
fasted
and
wept:
for
I
said,
Who
can
tell
whether
GOD
will
be
gracious
to
me,
that
the
child
may
live?
012:023
But
now
he
is
dead,
wherefore
should
I
fast?
can
I
bring
him
back
again?
I
shall
go
to
him,
but
he
shall
not
return
to
me.
012:024
And
David
comforted
Bathsheba
his
wife,
and
went
in
unto
her,
and
lay
with
her:
and
she
bare
a
son,
and
he
called
his
name
Solomon:
and
the
LORD
loved
him.
012:025
And
he
sent
by
the
hand
of
Nathan
the
prophet;
and
he
called
his
name
Jedidiah,
because
of
the
LORD.
012:026
And
Joab
fought
against
Rabbah
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
took
the
royal
city.
012:027
And
Joab
sent
messengers
to
David,
and
said,
I
have
fought
against
Rabbah,
and
have
taken
the
city
of
waters.
012:028
Now
therefore
gather
the
rest
of
the
people
together,
and
encamp
against
the
city,
and
take
it:
lest
I
take
the
city,
and
it
be
called
after
my
name.
012:029
And
David
gathered
all
the
people
together,
and
went
to
Rabbah,
and
fought
against
it,
and
took
it.
012:030
And
he
took
their
king's
crown
from
off
his
head,
the
weight
whereof
was
a
talent
of
gold
with
the
precious
stones:
and
it
was
set
on
David's
head.
And
he
brought
forth
the
spoil
of
the
city
in
great
abundance.
012:031
And
he
brought
forth
the
people
that
were
therein,
and
put
them
under
saws,
and
under
harrows
of
iron,
and
under
axes
of
iron,
and
made
them
pass
through
the
brick-kiln:
and
thus
did
he
unto
all
the
cities
of
the
children
of
Ammon.
So
David
and
all
the
people
returned
unto
Jerusalem.
013:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
Absalom
the
son
of
David
had
a
fair
sister,
whose
name
was
Tamar;
and
Amnon
the
son
of
David
loved
her.
013:002
And
Amnon
was
so
vexed,
that
he
fell
sick
for
his
sister
Tamar;
for
she
was
a
virgin;
and
Amnon
thought
it
hard
for
him
to
do
anything
to
her.
013:003
But
Amnon
had
a
friend,
whose
name
was
Jonadab,
the
son
of
Shimeah
David's
brother:
and
Jonadab
was
a
very
subtil
man.
013:004
And
he
said
unto
him,
Why
art
thou,
being
the
king's
son,
lean
from
day
to
day?
wilt
thou
not
tell
me?
And
Amnon
said
unto
him,
I
love
Tamar,
my
brother
Absalom's
sister.
013:005
And
Jonadab
said
unto
him,
Lay
thee
down
on
thy
bed,
and
make
thyself
sick:
and
when
thy
father
cometh
to
see
thee,
say
unto
him,
I
pray
thee,
let
my
sister
Tamar
come,
and
give
me
meat,
and
dress
the
meat
in
my
sight,
that
I
may
see
it,
and
eat
it
at
her
hand.
013:006
So
Amnon
lay
down,
and
made
himself
sick:
and
when
the
king
was
come
to
see
him,
Amnon
said
unto
the
king,
I
pray
thee,
let
Tamar
my
sister
come,
and
make
me
a
couple
of
cakes
in
my
sight,
that
I
may
eat
at
her
hand.
013:007
Then
David
sent
home
to
Tamar,
saying,
Go
now
to
thy
brother
Amnon's
house,
and
dress
him
meat.
013:008
So
Tamar
went
to
her
brother
Amnon's
house;
and
he
was
laid
down.
And
she
took
flour,
and
kneaded
it,
and
made
cakes
in
his
sight,
and
did
bake
the
cakes.
013:009
And
she
took
a
pan,
and
poured
them
out
before
him;
but
he
refused
to
eat.
And
Amnon
said,
Have
out
all
men
from
me.
And
they
went
out
every
man
from
him.
013:010
And
Amnon
said
unto
Tamar,
Bring
the
meat
into
the
chamber,
that
I
may
eat
of
thine
hand.
And
Tamar
took
the
cakes
which
she
had
made,
and
brought
them
into
the
chamber
to
Amnon
her
brother.
013:011
And
when
she
had
brought
them
unto
him
to
eat,
he
took
hold
of
her,
and
said
unto
her,
Come
lie
with
me,
my
sister.
013:012
And
she
answered
him,
Nay,
my
brother,
do
not
force
me;
for
no
such
thing
ought
to
be
done
in
Israel:
do
not
thou
this
folly.
013:013
And
I,
whither
shall
I
cause
my
shame
to
go?
and
as
for
thee,
thou
shalt
be
as
one
of
the
fools
in
Israel.
Now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
speak
unto
the
king;
for
he
will
not
withhold
me
from
thee.
013:014
Howbeit
he
would
not
hearken
unto
her
voice:
but,
being
stronger
than
she,
forced
her,
and
lay
with
her.
013:015
Then
Amnon
hated
her
exceedingly;
so
that
the
hatred
wherewith
he
hated
her
was
greater
than
the
love
wherewith
he
had
loved
her.
And
Amnon
said
unto
her,
Arise,
be
gone.
013:016
And
she
said
unto
him,
There
is
no
cause:
this
evil
in
sending
me
away
is
greater
than
the
other
that
thou
didst
unto
me.
But
he
would
not
hearken
unto
her.
013:017
Then
he
called
his
servant
that
ministered
unto
him,
and
said,
Put
now
this
woman
out
from
me,
and
bolt
the
door
after
her.
013:018
And
she
had
a
garment
of
divers
colours
upon
her:
for
with
such
robes
were
the
king's
daughters
that
were
virgins
apparelled.
Then
his
servant
brought
her
out,
and
bolted
the
door
after
her.
013:019
And
Tamar
put
ashes
on
her
head,
and
rent
her
garment
of
divers
colours
that
was
on
her,
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
head,
and
went
on
crying.
013:020
And
Absalom
her
brother
said
unto
her,
Hath
Amnon
thy
brother
been
with
thee?
but
hold
now
thy
peace,
my
sister:
he
is
thy
brother;
regard
not
this
thing.
So
Tamar
remained
desolate
in
her
brother
Absalom's
house.
013:021
But
when
king
David
heard
of
all
these
things,
he
was
very
wroth.
013:022
And
Absalom
spake
unto
his
brother
Amnon
neither
good
nor
bad:
for
Absalom
hated
Amnon,
because
he
had
forced
his
sister
Tamar.
013:023
And
it
came
to
pass
after
two
full
years,
that
Absalom
had
sheepshearers
in
Baalhazor,
which
is
beside
Ephraim:
and
Absalom
invited
all
the
king's
sons.
013:024
And
Absalom
came
to
the
king,
and
said,
Behold
now,
thy
servant
hath
sheepshearers;
let
the
king,
I
beseech
thee,
and
his
servants
go
with
thy
servant.
013:025
And
the
king
said
to
Absalom,
Nay,
my
son,
let
us
not
all
now
go,
lest
we
be
chargeable
unto
thee.
And
he
pressed
him:
howbeit
he
would
not
go,
but
blessed
him.
013:026
Then
said
Absalom,
If
not,
I
pray
thee,
let
my
brother
Amnon
go
with
us.
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
Why
should
he
go
with
thee?
013:027
But
Absalom
pressed
him,
that
he
let
Amnon
and
all
the
king's
sons
go
with
him.
013:028
Now
Absalom
had
commanded
his
servants,
saying,
Mark
ye
now
when
Amnon's
heart
is
merry
with
wine,
and
when
I
say
unto
you,
Smite
Amnon;
then
kill
him,
fear
not:
have
not
I
commanded
you?
be
courageous,
and
be
valiant.
013:029
And
the
servants
of
Absalom
did
unto
Amnon
as
Absalom
had
commanded.
Then
all
the
king's
sons
arose,
and
every
man
gat
him
up
upon
his
mule,
and
fled.
013:030
And
it
came
to
pass,
while
they
were
in
the
way,
that
tidings
came
to
David,
saying,
Absalom
hath
slain
all
the
king's
sons,
and
there
is
not
one
of
them
left.
013:031
Then
the
king
arose,
and
tare
his
garments,
and
lay
on
the
earth;
and
all
his
servants
stood
by
with
their
clothes
rent.
013:032
And
Jonadab,
the
son
of
Shimeah
David's
brother,
answered
and
said,
Let
not
my
lord
suppose
that
they
have
slain
all
the
young
men
the
king's
sons;
for
Amnon
only
is
dead:
for
by
the
appointment
of
Absalom
this
hath
been
determined
from
the
day
that
he
forced
his
sister
Tamar.
013:033
Now
therefore
let
not
my
lord
the
king
take
the
thing
to
his
heart,
to
think
that
all
the
king's
sons
are
dead:
for
Amnon
only
is
dead.
013:034
But
Absalom
fled.
And
the
young
man
that
kept
the
watch
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
looked,
and,
behold,
there
came
much
people
by
the
way
of
the
hill
side
behind
him.
013:035
And
Jonadab
said
unto
the
king,
Behold,
the
king's
sons
come:
as
thy
servant
said,
so
it
is.
013:036
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking,
that,
behold,
the
king's
sons
came,
and
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept:
and
the
king
also
and
all
his
servants
wept
very
sore.
013:037
But
Absalom
fled,
and
went
to
Talmai,
the
son
of
Ammihud,
king
of
Geshur.
And
David
mourned
for
his
son
every
day.
013:038
So
Absalom
fled,
and
went
to
Geshur,
and
was
there
three
years.
013:039
And
the
soul
of
king
David
longed
to
go
forth
unto
Absalom:
for
he
was
comforted
concerning
Amnon,
seeing
he
was
dead.
014:001
Now
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
perceived
that
the
king's
heart
was
toward
Absalom.
014:002
And
Joab
sent
to
Tekoah,
and
fetched
thence
a
wise
woman,
and
said
unto
her,
I
pray
thee,
feign
thyself
to
be
a
mourner,
and
put
on
now
mourning
apparel,
and
anoint
not
thyself
with
oil,
but
be
as
a
woman
that
had
a
long
time
mourned
for
the
dead:
014:003
And
come
to
the
king,
and
speak
on
this
manner
unto
him.
So
Joab
put
the
words
in
her
mouth.
014:004
And
when
the
woman
of
Tekoah
spake
to
the
king,
she
fell
on
her
face
to
the
ground,
and
did
obeisance,
and
said,
Help,
O
king.
014:005
And
the
king
said
unto
her,
What
aileth
thee?
And
she
answered,
I
am
indeed
a
widow
woman,
and
mine
husband
is
dead.
014:006
And
thy
handmaid
had
two
sons,
and
they
two
strove
together
in
the
field,
and
there
was
none
to
part
them,
but
the
one
smote
the
other,
and
slew
him.
014:007
And,
behold,
the
whole
family
is
risen
against
thine
handmaid,
and
they
said,
Deliver
him
that
smote
his
brother,
that
we
may
kill
him,
for
the
life
of
his
brother
whom
he
slew;
and
we
will
destroy
the
heir
also:
and
so
they
shall
quench
my
coal
which
is
left,
and
shall
not
leave
to
my
husband
neither
name
nor
remainder
upon
the
earth.
014:008
And
the
king
said
unto
the
woman,
Go
to
thine
house,
and
I
will
give
charge
concerning
thee.
014:009
And
the
woman
of
Tekoah
said
unto
the
king,
My
lord,
O
king,
the
iniquity
be
on
me,
and
on
my
father's
house:
and
the
king
and
his
throne
be
guiltless.
014:010
And
the
king
said,
Whoever
saith
ought
unto
thee,
bring
him
to
me,
and
he
shall
not
touch
thee
any
more.
014:011
Then
said
she,
I
pray
thee,
let
the
king
remember
the
LORD
thy
God,
that
thou
wouldest
not
suffer
the
revengers
of
blood
to
destroy
any
more,
lest
they
destroy
my
son.
And
he
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
there
shall
not
one
hair
of
thy
son
fall
to
the
earth.
014:012
Then
the
woman
said,
Let
thine
handmaid,
I
pray
thee,
speak
one
word
unto
my
lord
the
king.
And
he
said,
Say
on.
014:013
And
the
woman
said,
Wherefore
then
hast
thou
thought
such
a
thing
against
the
people
of
God?
for
the
king
doth
speak
this
thing
as
one
which
is
faulty,
in
that
the
king
doth
not
fetch
home
again
his
banished.
014:014
For
we
must
needs
die,
and
are
as
water
spilt
on
the
ground,
which
cannot
be
gathered
up
again;
neither
doth
God
respect
any
person:
yet
doth
he
devise
means,
that
his
banished
be
not
expelled
from
him.
014:015
Now
therefore
that
I
am
come
to
speak
of
this
thing
unto
my
lord
the
king,
it
is
because
the
people
have
made
me
afraid:
and
thy
handmaid
said,
I
will
now
speak
unto
the
king;
it
may
be
that
the
king
will
perform
the
request
of
his
handmaid.
014:016
For
the
king
will
hear,
to
deliver
his
handmaid
out
of
the
hand
of
the
man
that
would
destroy
me
and
my
son
together
out
of
the
inheritance
of
God.
014:017
Then
thine
handmaid
said,
The
word
of
my
lord
the
king
shall
now
be
comfortable:
for
as
an
angel
of
God,
so
is
my
lord
the
king
to
discern
good
and
bad:
therefore
the
LORD
thy
God
will
be
with
thee.
014:018
Then
the
king
answered
and
said
unto
the
woman,
Hide
not
from
me,
I
pray
thee,
the
thing
that
I
shall
ask
thee.
And
the
woman
said,
Let
my
lord
the
king
now
speak.
014:019
And
the
king
said,
Is
not
the
hand
of
Joab
with
thee
in
all
this?
And
the
woman
answered
and
said,
As
thy
soul
liveth,
my
lord
the
king,
none
can
turn
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
from
ought
that
my
lord
the
king
hath
spoken:
for
thy
servant
Joab,
he
bade
me,
and
he
put
all
these
words
in
the
mouth
of
thine
handmaid:
014:020
To
fetch
about
this
form
of
speech
hath
thy
servant
Joab
done
this
thing:
and
my
lord
is
wise,
according
to
the
wisdom
of
an
angel
of
God,
to
know
all
things
that
are
in
the
earth.
014:021
And
the
king
said
unto
Joab,
Behold
now,
I
have
done
this
thing:
go
therefore,
bring
the
young
man
Absalom
again.
014:022
And
Joab
fell
to
the
ground
on
his
face,
and
bowed
himself,
and
thanked
the
king:
and
Joab
said,
To
day
thy
servant
knoweth
that
I
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight,
my
lord,
O
king,
in
that
the
king
hath
fulfilled
the
request
of
his
servant.
014:023
So
Joab
arose
and
went
to
Geshur,
and
brought
Absalom
to
Jerusalem.
014:024
And
the
king
said,
Let
him
turn
to
his
own
house,
and
let
him
not
see
my
face.
So
Absalom
returned
to
his
own
house,
and
saw
not
the
king's
face.
014:025
But
in
all
Israel
there
was
none
to
be
so
much
praised
as
Absalom
for
his
beauty:
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
even
to
the
crown
of
his
head
there
was
no
blemish
in
him.
014:026
And
when
he
polled
his
head,
(for
it
was
at
every
year's
end
that
he
polled
it:
because
the
hair
was
heavy
on
him,
therefore
he
polled
it:)
he
weighed
the
hair
of
his
head
at
two
hundred
shekels
after
the
king's
weight.
014:027
And
unto
Absalom
there
were
born
three
sons,
and
one
daughter,
whose
name
was
Tamar:
she
was
a
woman
of
a
fair
countenance.
014:028
So
Absalom
dwelt
two
full
years
in
Jerusalem,
and
saw
not
the
king's
face.
014:029
Therefore
Absalom
sent
for
Joab,
to
have
sent
him
to
the
king;
but
he
would
not
come
to
him:
and
when
he
sent
again
the
second
time,
he
would
not
come.
014:030
Therefore
he
said
unto
his
servants,
See,
Joab's
field
is
near
mine,
and
he
hath
barley
there;
go
and
set
it
on
fire.
And
Absalom's
servants
set
the
field
on
fire.
014:031
Then
Joab
arose,
and
came
to
Absalom
unto
his
house,
and
said
unto
him,
Wherefore
have
thy
servants
set
my
field
on
fire?
014:032
And
Absalom
answered
Joab,
Behold,
I
sent
unto
thee,
saying,
Come
hither,
that
I
may
send
thee
to
the
king,
to
say,
Wherefore
am
I
come
from
Geshur?
it
had
been
good
for
me
to
have
been
there
still:
now
therefore
let
me
see
the
king's
face;
and
if
