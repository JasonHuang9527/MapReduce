there
be
any
iniquity
in
me,
let
him
kill
me.
014:033
So
Joab
came
to
the
king,
and
told
him:
and
when
he
had
called
for
Absalom,
he
came
to
the
king,
and
bowed
himself
on
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
king:
and
the
king
kissed
Absalom.
015:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
Absalom
prepared
him
chariots
and
horses,
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
him.
015:002
And
Absalom
rose
up
early,
and
stood
beside
the
way
of
the
gate:
and
it
was
so,
that
when
any
man
that
had
a
controversy
came
to
the
king
for
judgment,
then
Absalom
called
unto
him,
and
said,
Of
what
city
art
thou?
And
he
said,
Thy
servant
is
of
one
of
the
tribes
of
Israel.
015:003
And
Absalom
said
unto
him,
See,
thy
matters
are
good
and
right;
but
there
is
no
man
deputed
of
the
king
to
hear
thee.
015:004
Absalom
said
moreover,
Oh
that
I
were
made
judge
in
the
land,
that
every
man
which
hath
any
suit
or
cause
might
come
unto
me,
and
I
would
do
him
justice!
015:005
And
it
was
so,
that
when
any
man
came
nigh
to
him
to
do
him
obeisance,
he
put
forth
his
hand,
and
took
him,
and
kissed
him.
015:006
And
on
this
manner
did
Absalom
to
all
Israel
that
came
to
the
king
for
judgment:
so
Absalom
stole
the
hearts
of
the
men
of
Israel.
015:007
And
it
came
to
pass
after
forty
years,
that
Absalom
said
unto
the
king,
I
pray
thee,
let
me
go
and
pay
my
vow,
which
I
have
vowed
unto
the
LORD,
in
Hebron.
015:008
For
thy
servant
vowed
a
vow
while
I
abode
at
Geshur
in
Syria,
saying,
If
the
LORD
shall
bring
me
again
indeed
to
Jerusalem,
then
I
will
serve
the
LORD.
015:009
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
Go
in
peace.
So
he
arose,
and
went
to
Hebron.
015:010
But
Absalom
sent
spies
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
saying,
As
soon
as
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet,
then
ye
shall
say,
Absalom
reigneth
in
Hebron.
015:011
And
with
Absalom
went
two
hundred
men
out
of
Jerusalem,
that
were
called;
and
they
went
in
their
simplicity,
and
they
knew
not
any
thing.
015:012
And
Absalom
sent
for
Ahithophel
the
Gilonite,
David's
counsellor,
from
his
city,
even
from
Giloh,
while
he
offered
sacrifices.
And
the
conspiracy
was
strong;
for
the
people
increased
continually
with
Absalom.
015:013
And
there
came
a
messenger
to
David,
saying,
The
hearts
of
the
men
of
Israel
are
after
Absalom.
015:014
And
David
said
unto
all
his
servants
that
were
with
him
at
Jerusalem,
Arise,
and
let
us
flee;
for
we
shall
not
else
escape
from
Absalom:
make
speed
to
depart,
lest
he
overtake
us
suddenly,
and
bring
evil
upon
us,
and
smite
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword.
015:015
And
the
king's
servants
said
unto
the
king,
Behold,
thy
servants
are
ready
to
do
whatsoever
my
lord
the
king
shall
appoint.
015:016
And
the
king
went
forth,
and
all
his
household
after
him.
And
the
king
left
ten
women,
which
were
concubines,
to
keep
the
house.
015:017
And
the
king
went
forth,
and
all
the
people
after
him,
and
tarried
in
a
place
that
was
far
off.
015:018
And
all
his
servants
passed
on
beside
him;
and
all
the
Cherethites,
and
all
the
Pelethites,
and
all
the
Gittites,
six
hundred
men
which
came
after
him
from
Gath,
passed
on
before
the
king.
015:019
Then
said
the
king
to
Ittai
the
Gittite,
Wherefore
goest
thou
also
with
us?
return
to
thy
place,
and
abide
with
the
king:
for
thou
art
a
stranger,
and
also
an
exile.
015:020
Whereas
thou
camest
but
yesterday,
should
I
this
day
make
thee
go
up
and
down
with
us?
seeing
I
go
whither
I
may,
return
thou,
and
take
back
thy
brethren:
mercy
and
truth
be
with
thee.
015:021
And
Ittai
answered
the
king,
and
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
and
as
my
lord
the
king
liveth,
surely
in
what
place
my
lord
the
king
shall
be,
whether
in
death
or
life,
even
there
also
will
thy
servant
be.
015:022
And
David
said
to
Ittai,
Go
and
pass
over.
And
Ittai
the
Gittite
passed
over,
and
all
his
men,
and
all
the
little
ones
that
were
with
him.
015:023
And
all
the
country
wept
with
a
loud
voice,
and
all
the
people
passed
over:
the
king
also
himself
passed
over
the
brook
Kidron,
and
all
the
people
passed
over,
toward
the
way
of
the
wilderness.
015:024
And
lo
Zadok
also,
and
all
the
Levites
were
with
him,
bearing
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
God:
and
they
set
down
the
ark
of
God;
and
Abiathar
went
up,
until
all
the
people
had
done
passing
out
of
the
city.
015:025
And
the
king
said
unto
Zadok,
Carry
back
the
ark
of
God
into
the
city:
if
I
shall
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
he
will
bring
me
again,
and
shew
me
both
it,
and
his
habitation:
015:026
But
if
he
thus
say,
I
have
no
delight
in
thee;
behold,
here
am
I,
let
him
do
to
me
as
seemeth
good
unto
him.
015:027
The
king
said
also
unto
Zadok
the
priest,
Art
not
thou
a
seer?
return
into
the
city
in
peace,
and
your
two
sons
with
you,
Ahimaaz
thy
son,
and
Jonathan
the
son
of
Abiathar.
015:028
See,
I
will
tarry
in
the
plain
of
the
wilderness,
until
there
come
word
from
you
to
certify
me.
015:029
Zadok
therefore
and
Abiathar
carried
the
ark
of
God
again
to
Jerusalem:
and
they
tarried
there.
015:030
And
David
went
up
by
the
ascent
of
mount
Olivet,
and
wept
as
he
went
up,
and
had
his
head
covered,
and
he
went
barefoot:
and
all
the
people
that
was
with
him
covered
every
man
his
head,
and
they
went
up,
weeping
as
they
went
up.
015:031
And
one
told
David,
saying,
Ahithophel
is
among
the
conspirators
with
Absalom.
And
David
said,
O
LORD,
I
pray
thee,
turn
the
counsel
of
Ahithophel
into
foolishness.
015:032
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
David
was
come
to
the
top
of
the
mount,
where
he
worshipped
God,
behold,
Hushai
the
Archite
came
to
meet
him
with
his
coat
rent,
and
earth
upon
his
head:
015:033
Unto
whom
David
said,
If
thou
passest
on
with
me,
then
thou
shalt
be
a
burden
unto
me:
015:034
But
if
thou
return
to
the
city,
and
say
unto
Absalom,
I
will
be
thy
servant,
O
king;
as
I
have
been
thy
father's
servant
hitherto,
so
will
I
now
also
be
thy
servant:
then
mayest
thou
for
me
defeat
the
counsel
of
Ahithophel.
015:035
And
hast
thou
not
there
with
thee
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests?
therefore
it
shall
be,
that
what
thing
soever
thou
shalt
hear
out
of
the
king's
house,
thou
shalt
tell
it
to
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests.
015:036
Behold,
they
have
there
with
them
their
two
sons,
Ahimaaz
Zadok's
son,
and
Jonathan
Abiathar's
son;
and
by
them
ye
shall
send
unto
me
every
thing
that
ye
can
hear.
015:037
So
Hushai
David's
friend
came
into
the
city,
and
Absalom
came
into
Jerusalem.
016:001
And
when
David
was
a
little
past
the
top
of
the
hill,
behold,
Ziba
the
servant
of
Mephibosheth
met
him,
with
a
couple
of
asses
saddled,
and
upon
them
two
hundred
loaves
of
bread,
and
an
hundred
bunches
of
raisins,
and
an
hundred
of
summer
fruits,
and
a
bottle
of
wine.
016:002
And
the
king
said
unto
Ziba,
What
meanest
thou
by
these?
And
Ziba
said,
The
asses
be
for
the
king's
household
to
ride
on;
and
the
bread
and
summer
fruit
for
the
young
men
to
eat;
and
the
wine,
that
such
as
be
faint
in
the
wilderness
may
drink.
016:003
And
the
king
said,
And
where
is
thy
master's
son?
And
Ziba
said
unto
the
king,
Behold,
he
abideth
at
Jerusalem:
for
he
said,
To
day
shall
the
house
of
Israel
restore
me
the
kingdom
of
my
father.
016:004
Then
said
the
king
to
Ziba,
Behold,
thine
are
all
that
pertained
unto
Mephibosheth.
And
Ziba
said,
I
humbly
beseech
thee
that
I
may
find
grace
in
thy
sight,
my
lord,
O
king.
016:005
And
when
king
David
came
to
Bahurim,
behold,
thence
came
out
a
man
of
the
family
of
the
house
of
Saul,
whose
name
was
Shimei,
the
son
of
Gera:
he
came
forth,
and
cursed
still
as
he
came.
016:006
And
he
cast
stones
at
David,
and
at
all
the
servants
of
king
David:
and
all
the
people
and
all
the
mighty
men
were
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left.
016:007
And
thus
said
Shimei
when
he
cursed,
Come
out,
come
out,
thou
bloody
man,
and
thou
man
of
Belial:
016:008
The
LORD
hath
returned
upon
thee
all
the
blood
of
the
house
of
Saul,
in
whose
stead
thou
hast
reigned;
and
the
LORD
hath
delivered
the
kingdom
into
the
hand
of
Absalom
thy
son:
and,
behold,
thou
art
taken
in
thy
mischief,
because
thou
art
a
bloody
man.
016:009
Then
said
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
unto
the
king,
Why
should
this
dead
dog
curse
my
lord
the
king?
let
me
go
over,
I
pray
thee,
and
take
off
his
head.
016:010
And
the
king
said,
What
have
I
to
do
with
you,
ye
sons
of
Zeruiah?
so
let
him
curse,
because
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
him,
Curse
David.
Who
shall
then
say,
Wherefore
hast
thou
done
so?
016:011
And
David
said
to
Abishai,
and
to
all
his
servants,
Behold,
my
son,
which
came
forth
of
my
bowels,
seeketh
my
life:
how
much
more
now
may
this
Benjamite
do
it?
let
him
alone,
and
let
him
curse;
for
the
LORD
hath
bidden
him.
016:012
It
may
be
that
the
LORD
will
look
on
mine
affliction,
and
that
the
LORD
will
requite
me
good
for
his
cursing
this
day.
016:013
And
as
David
and
his
men
went
by
the
way,
Shimei
went
along
on
the
hill's
side
over
against
him,
and
cursed
as
he
went,
and
threw
stones
at
him,
and
cast
dust.
016:014
And
the
king,
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him,
came
weary,
and
refreshed
themselves
there.
016:015
And
Absalom,
and
all
the
people
the
men
of
Israel,
came
to
Jerusalem,
and
Ahithophel
with
him.
016:016
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Hushai
the
Archite,
David's
friend,
was
come
unto
Absalom,
that
Hushai
said
unto
Absalom,
God
save
the
king,
God
save
the
king.
016:017
And
Absalom
said
to
Hushai,
Is
this
thy
kindness
to
thy
friend?
why
wentest
thou
not
with
thy
friend?
016:018
And
Hushai
said
unto
Absalom,
Nay;
but
whom
the
LORD,
and
this
people,
and
all
the
men
of
Israel,
choose,
his
will
I
be,
and
with
him
will
I
abide.
016:019
And
again,
whom
should
I
serve?
should
I
not
serve
in
the
presence
of
his
son?
as
I
have
served
in
thy
father's
presence,
so
will
I
be
in
thy
presence.
016:020
Then
said
Absalom
to
Ahithophel,
Give
counsel
among
you
what
we
shall
do.
016:021
And
Ahithophel
said
unto
Absalom,
Go
in
unto
thy
father's
concubines,
which
he
hath
left
to
keep
the
house;
and
all
Israel
shall
hear
that
thou
art
abhorred
of
thy
father:
then
shall
the
hands
of
all
that
are
with
thee
be
strong.
016:022
So
they
spread
Absalom
a
tent
upon
the
top
of
the
house;
and
Absalom
went
in
unto
his
father's
concubines
in
the
sight
of
all
Israel.
016:023
And
the
counsel
of
Ahithophel,
which
he
counselled
in
those
days,
was
as
if
a
man
had
enquired
at
the
oracle
of
God:
so
was
all
the
counsel
of
Ahithophel
both
with
David
and
with
Absalom.
017:001
Moreover
Ahithophel
said
unto
Absalom,
Let
me
now
choose
out
twelve
thousand
men,
and
I
will
arise
and
pursue
after
David
this
night:
017:002
And
I
will
come
upon
him
while
he
is
weary
and
weak
handed,
and
will
make
him
afraid:
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
him
shall
flee;
and
I
will
smite
the
king
only:
017:003
And
I
will
bring
back
all
the
people
unto
thee:
the
man
whom
thou
seekest
is
as
if
all
returned:
so
all
the
people
shall
be
in
peace.
017:004
And
the
saying
pleased
Absalom
well,
and
all
the
elders
of
Israel.
017:005
Then
said
Absalom,
Call
now
Hushai
the
Archite
also,
and
let
us
hear
likewise
what
he
saith.
017:006
And
when
Hushai
was
come
to
Absalom,
Absalom
spake
unto
him,
saying,
Ahithophel
hath
spoken
after
this
manner:
shall
we
do
after
his
saying?
if
not;
speak
thou.
017:007
And
Hushai
said
unto
Absalom,
The
counsel
that
Ahithophel
hath
given
is
not
good
at
this
time.
017:008
For,
said
Hushai,
thou
knowest
thy
father
and
his
men,
that
they
be
mighty
men,
and
they
be
chafed
in
their
minds,
as
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
in
the
field:
and
thy
father
is
a
man
of
war,
and
will
not
lodge
with
the
people.
017:009
Behold,
he
is
hid
now
in
some
pit,
or
in
some
other
place:
and
it
will
come
to
pass,
when
some
of
them
be
overthrown
at
the
first,
that
whosoever
heareth
it
will
say,
There
is
a
slaughter
among
the
people
that
follow
Absalom.
017:010
And
he
also
that
is
valiant,
whose
heart
is
as
the
heart
of
a
lion,
shall
utterly
melt:
for
all
Israel
knoweth
that
thy
father
is
a
mighty
man,
and
they
which
be
with
him
are
valiant
men.
017:011
Therefore
I
counsel
that
all
Israel
be
generally
gathered
unto
thee,
from
Dan
even
to
Beersheba,
as
the
sand
that
is
by
the
sea
for
multitude;
and
that
thou
go
to
battle
in
thine
own
person.
017:012
So
shall
we
come
upon
him
in
some
place
where
he
shall
be
found,
and
we
will
light
upon
him
as
the
dew
falleth
on
the
ground:
and
of
him
and
of
all
the
men
that
are
with
him
there
shall
not
be
left
so
much
as
one.
017:013
Moreover,
if
he
be
gotten
into
a
city,
then
shall
all
Israel
bring
ropes
to
that
city,
and
we
will
draw
it
into
the
river,
until
there
be
not
one
small
stone
found
there.
017:014
And
Absalom
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
said,
The
counsel
of
Hushai
the
Archite
is
better
than
the
counsel
of
Ahithophel.
For
the
LORD
had
appointed
to
defeat
the
good
counsel
of
Ahithophel,
to
the
intent
that
the
LORD
might
bring
evil
upon
Absalom.
017:015
Then
said
Hushai
unto
Zadok
and
to
Abiathar
the
priests,
Thus
and
thus
did
Ahithophel
counsel
Absalom
and
the
elders
of
Israel;
and
thus
and
thus
have
I
counselled.
017:016
Now
therefore
send
quickly,
and
tell
David,
saying,
Lodge
not
this
night
in
the
plains
of
the
wilderness,
but
speedily
pass
over;
lest
the
king
be
swallowed
up,
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
him.
017:017
Now
Jonathan
and
Ahimaaz
stayed
by
Enrogel;
for
they
might
not
be
seen
to
come
into
the
city:
and
a
wench
went
and
told
them;
and
they
went
and
told
king
David.
017:018
Nevertheless
a
lad
saw
them,
and
told
Absalom:
but
they
went
both
of
them
away
quickly,
and
came
to
a
man's
house
in
Bahurim,
which
had
a
well
in
his
court;
whither
they
went
down.
017:019
And
the
woman
took
and
spread
a
covering
over
the
well's
mouth,
and
spread
ground
corn
thereon;
and
the
thing
was
not
known.
017:020
And
when
Absalom's
servants
came
to
the
woman
to
the
house,
they
said,
Where
is
Ahimaaz
and
Jonathan?
And
the
woman
said
unto
them,
They
be
gone
over
the
brook
of
water.
And
when
they
had
sought
and
could
not
find
them,
they
returned
to
Jerusalem.
017:021
And
it
came
to
pass,
after
they
were
departed,
that
they
came
up
out
of
the
well,
and
went
and
told
king
David,
and
said
unto
David,
Arise,
and
pass
quickly
over
the
water:
for
thus
hath
Ahithophel
counselled
against
you.
017:022
Then
David
arose,
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him,
and
they
passed
over
Jordan:
by
the
morning
light
there
lacked
not
one
of
them
that
was
not
gone
over
Jordan.
017:023
And
when
Ahithophel
saw
that
his
counsel
was
not
followed,
he
saddled
his
ass,
and
arose,
and
gat
him
home
to
his
house,
to
his
city,
and
put
his
household
in
order,
and
hanged
himself,
and
died,
and
was
buried
in
the
sepulchre
of
his
father.
017:024
Then
David
came
to
Mahanaim.
And
Absalom
passed
over
Jordan,
he
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
with
him.
017:025
And
Absalom
made
Amasa
captain
of
the
host
instead
of
Joab:
which
Amasa
was
a
man's
son,
whose
name
was
Ithra
an
Israelite,
that
went
in
to
Abigail
the
daughter
of
Nahash,
sister
to
Zeruiah
Joab's
mother.
017:026
So
Israel
and
Absalom
pitched
in
the
land
of
Gilead.
017:027
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
David
was
come
to
Mahanaim,
that
Shobi
the
son
of
Nahash
of
Rabbah
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
Machir
the
son
of
Ammiel
of
Lodebar,
and
Barzillai
the
Gileadite
of
Rogelim,
017:028
Brought
beds,
and
basons,
and
earthen
vessels,
and
wheat,
and
barley,
and
flour,
and
parched
corn,
and
beans,
and
lentiles,
and
parched
pulse,
017:029
And
honey,
and
butter,
and
sheep,
and
cheese
of
kine,
for
David,
and
for
the
people
that
were
with
him,
to
eat:
for
they
said,
The
people
is
hungry,
and
weary,
and
thirsty,
in
the
wilderness.
018:001
And
David
numbered
the
people
that
were
with
him,
and
set
captains
of
thousands,
and
captains
of
hundreds
over
them.
018:002
And
David
sent
forth
a
third
part
of
the
people
under
the
hand
of
Joab,
and
a
third
part
under
the
hand
of
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
Joab's
brother,
and
a
third
part
under
the
hand
of
Ittai
the
Gittite.
And
the
king
said
unto
the
people,
I
will
surely
go
forth
with
you
myself
also.
018:003
But
the
people
answered,
Thou
shalt
not
go
forth:
for
if
we
flee
away,
they
will
not
care
for
us;
neither
if
half
of
us
die,
will
they
care
for
us:
but
now
thou
art
worth
ten
thousand
of
us:
therefore
now
it
is
better
that
thou
succour
us
out
of
the
city.
018:004
And
the
king
said
unto
them,
What
seemeth
you
best
I
will
do.
And
the
king
stood
by
the
gate
side,
and
all
the
people
came
out
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands.
018:005
And
the
king
commanded
Joab
and
Abishai
and
Ittai,
saying,
Deal
gently
for
my
sake
with
the
young
man,
even
with
Absalom.
And
all
the
people
heard
when
the
king
gave
all
the
captains
charge
concerning
Absalom.
018:006
So
the
people
went
out
into
the
field
against
Israel:
and
the
battle
was
in
the
wood
of
Ephraim;
018:007
Where
the
people
of
Israel
were
slain
before
the
servants
of
David,
and
there
was
there
a
great
slaughter
that
day
of
twenty
thousand
men.
018:008
For
the
battle
was
there
scattered
over
the
face
of
all
the
country:
and
the
wood
devoured
more
people
that
day
than
the
sword
devoured.
018:009
And
Absalom
met
the
servants
of
David.
And
Absalom
rode
upon
a
mule,
and
the
mule
went
under
the
thick
boughs
of
a
great
oak,
and
his
head
caught
hold
of
the
oak,
and
he
was
taken
up
between
the
heaven
and
the
earth;
and
the
mule
that
was
under
him
went
away.
018:010
And
a
certain
man
saw
it,
and
told
Joab,
and
said,
Behold,
I
saw
Absalom
hanged
in
an
oak.
018:011
And
Joab
said
unto
the
man
that
told
him,
And,
behold,
thou
sawest
him,
and
why
didst
thou
not
smite
him
there
to
the
ground?
and
I
would
have
given
thee
ten
shekels
of
silver,
and
a
girdle.
018:012
And
the
man
said
unto
Joab,
Though
I
should
receive
a
thousand
shekels
of
silver
in
mine
hand,
yet
would
I
not
put
forth
mine
hand
against
the
king's
son:
for
in
our
hearing
the
king
charged
thee
and
Abishai
and
Ittai,
saying,
Beware
that
none
touch
the
young
man
Absalom.
018:013
Otherwise
I
should
have
wrought
falsehood
against
mine
own
life:
for
there
is
no
matter
hid
from
the
king,
and
thou
thyself
wouldest
have
set
thyself
against
me.
018:014
Then
said
Joab,
I
may
not
tarry
thus
with
thee.
And
he
took
three
darts
in
his
hand,
and
thrust
them
through
the
heart
of
Absalom,
while
he
was
yet
alive
in
the
midst
of
the
oak.
018:015
And
ten
young
men
that
bare
Joab's
armour
compassed
about
and
smote
Absalom,
and
slew
him.
018:016
And
Joab
blew
the
trumpet,
and
the
people
returned
from
pursuing
after
Israel:
for
Joab
held
back
the
people.
018:017
And
they
took
Absalom,
and
cast
him
into
a
great
pit
in
the
wood,
and
laid
a
very
great
heap
of
stones
upon
him:
and
all
Israel
fled
every
one
to
his
tent.
018:018
Now
Absalom
in
his
lifetime
had
taken
and
reared
up
for
himself
a
pillar,
which
is
in
the
king's
dale:
for
he
said,
I
have
no
son
to
keep
my
name
in
remembrance:
and
he
called
the
pillar
after
his
own
name:
and
it
is
called
unto
this
day,
Absalom's
place.
018:019
Then
said
Ahimaaz
the
son
of
Zadok,
Let
me
now
run,
and
bear
the
king
tidings,
how
that
the
LORD
hath
avenged
him
of
his
enemies.
018:020
And
Joab
said
unto
him,
Thou
shalt
not
bear
tidings
this
day,
but
thou
shalt
bear
tidings
another
day:
but
this
day
thou
shalt
bear
no
tidings,
because
the
king's
son
is
dead.
018:021
Then
said
Joab
to
Cushi,
Go
tell
the
king
what
thou
hast
seen.
And
Cushi
bowed
himself
unto
Joab,
and
ran.
018:022
Then
said
Ahimaaz
the
son
of
Zadok
yet
again
to
Joab,
But
howsoever,
let
me,
I
pray
thee,
also
run
after
Cushi.
And
Joab
said,
Wherefore
wilt
thou
run,
my
son,
seeing
that
thou
hast
no
tidings
ready?
018:023
But
howsoever,
said
he,
let
me
run.
And
he
said
unto
him,
Run.
Then
Ahimaaz
ran
by
the
way
of
the
plain,
and
overran
Cushi.
018:024
And
David
sat
between
the
two
gates:
and
the
watchman
went
up
to
the
roof
over
the
gate
unto
the
wall,
and
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
looked,
and
behold
a
man
running
alone.
018:025
And
the
watchman
cried,
and
told
the
king.
And
the
king
said,
If
he
be
alone,
there
is
tidings
in
his
mouth.
And
he
came
apace,
and
drew
near.
018:026
And
the
watchman
saw
another
man
running:
and
the
watchman
called
unto
the
porter,
and
said,
Behold
another
man
running
alone.
And
the
king
said,
He
also
bringeth
tidings.
018:027
And
the
watchman
said,
Me
thinketh
the
running
of
the
foremost
is
like
the
running
of
Ahimaaz
the
son
of
Zadok.
And
the
king
said,
He
is
a
good
man,
and
cometh
with
good
tidings.
018:028
And
Ahimaaz
called,
and
said
unto
the
king,
All
is
well.
And
he
fell
down
to
the
earth
upon
his
face
before
the
king,
and
said,
Blessed
be
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
hath
delivered
up
the
men
that
lifted
up
their
hand
against
my
lord
the
king.
018:029
And
the
king
said,
Is
the
young
man
Absalom
safe?
And
Ahimaaz
answered,
When
Joab
sent
the
king's
servant,
and
me
thy
servant,
I
saw
a
great
tumult,
but
I
knew
not
what
it
was.
018:030
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
Turn
aside,
and
stand
here.
And
he
turned
aside,
and
stood
still.
018:031
And,
behold,
Cushi
came;
and
Cushi
said,
Tidings,
my
lord
the
king:
for
the
LORD
hath
avenged
thee
this
day
of
all
them
that
rose
up
against
thee.
018:032
And
the
king
said
unto
Cushi,
Is
the
young
man
Absalom
safe?
And
Cushi
answered,
The
enemies
of
my
lord
the
king,
and
all
that
rise
against
thee
to
do
thee
hurt,
be
as
that
young
man
is.
018:033
And
the
king
was
much
moved,
and
went
up
to
the
chamber
over
the
gate,
and
wept:
and
as
he
went,
thus
he
said,
O
my
son
Absalom,
my
son,
my
son
Absalom!
would
God
I
had
died
for
thee,
O
Absalom,
my
son,
my
son!
019:001
And
it
was
told
Joab,
Behold,
the
king
weepeth
and
mourneth
for
Absalom.
019:002
And
the
victory
that
day
was
turned
into
mourning
unto
all
the
people:
for
the
people
heard
say
that
day
how
the
king
