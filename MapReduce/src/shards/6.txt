will
accept
of
me.
032:021
So
went
the
present
over
before
him:
and
himself
lodged
that
night
in
the
company.
032:022
And
he
rose
up
that
night,
and
took
his
two
wives,
and
his
two
womenservants,
and
his
eleven
sons,
and
passed
over
the
ford
Jabbok.
032:023
And
he
took
them,
and
sent
them
over
the
brook,
and
sent
over
that
he
had.
032:024
And
Jacob
was
left
alone;
and
there
wrestled
a
man
with
him
until
the
breaking
of
the
day.
032:025
And
when
he
saw
that
he
prevailed
not
against
him,
he
touched
the
hollow
of
his
thigh;
and
the
hollow
of
Jacob's
thigh
was
out
of
joint,
as
he
wrestled
with
him.
032:026
And
he
said,
Let
me
go,
for
the
day
breaketh.
And
he
said,
I
will
not
let
thee
go,
except
thou
bless
me.
032:027
And
he
said
unto
him,
What
is
thy
name?
And
he
said,
Jacob.
032:028
And
he
said,
Thy
name
shall
be
called
no
more
Jacob,
but
Israel:
for
as
a
prince
hast
thou
power
with
God
and
with
men,
and
hast
prevailed.
032:029
And
Jacob
asked
him,
and
said,
Tell
me,
I
pray
thee,
thy
name.
And
he
said,
Wherefore
is
it
that
thou
dost
ask
after
my
name?
And
he
blessed
him
there.
032:030
And
Jacob
called
the
name
of
the
place
Peniel:
for
I
have
seen
God
face
to
face,
and
my
life
is
preserved.
032:031
And
as
he
passed
over
Penuel
the
sun
rose
upon
him,
and
he
halted
upon
his
thigh.
032:032
Therefore
the
children
of
Israel
eat
not
of
the
sinew
which
shrank,
which
is
upon
the
hollow
of
the
thigh,
unto
this
day:
because
he
touched
the
hollow
of
Jacob's
thigh
in
the
sinew
that
shrank.
033:001
And
Jacob
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
looked,
and,
behold,
Esau
came,
and
with
him
four
hundred
men.
And
he
divided
the
children
unto
Leah,
and
unto
Rachel,
and
unto
the
two
handmaids.
033:002
And
he
put
the
handmaids
and
their
children
foremost,
and
Leah
and
her
children
after,
and
Rachel
and
Joseph
hindermost.
033:003
And
he
passed
over
before
them,
and
bowed
himself
to
the
ground
seven
times,
until
he
came
near
to
his
brother.
033:004
And
Esau
ran
to
meet
him,
and
embraced
him,
and
fell
on
his
neck,
and
kissed
him:
and
they
wept.
033:005
And
he
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
saw
the
women
and
the
children;
and
said,
Who
are
those
with
thee?
And
he
said,
The
children
which
God
hath
graciously
given
thy
servant.
033:006
Then
the
handmaidens
came
near,
they
and
their
children,
and
they
bowed
themselves.
033:007
And
Leah
also
with
her
children
came
near,
and
bowed
themselves:
and
after
came
Joseph
near
and
Rachel,
and
they
bowed
themselves.
033:008
And
he
said,
What
meanest
thou
by
all
this
drove
which
I
met?
And
he
said,
These
are
to
find
grace
in
the
sight
of
my
lord.
033:009
And
Esau
said,
I
have
enough,
my
brother;
keep
that
thou
hast
unto
thyself.
033:010
And
Jacob
said,
Nay,
I
pray
thee,
if
now
I
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight,
then
receive
my
present
at
my
hand:
for
therefore
I
have
seen
thy
face,
as
though
I
had
seen
the
face
of
God,
and
thou
wast
pleased
with
me.
033:011
Take,
I
pray
thee,
my
blessing
that
is
brought
to
thee;
because
God
hath
dealt
graciously
with
me,
and
because
I
have
enough.
And
he
urged
him,
and
he
took
it.
033:012
And
he
said,
Let
us
take
our
journey,
and
let
us
go,
and
I
will
go
before
thee.
033:013
And
he
said
unto
him,
My
lord
knoweth
that
the
children
are
tender,
and
the
flocks
and
herds
with
young
are
with
me:
and
if
men
should
overdrive
them
one
day,
all
the
flock
will
die.
033:014
Let
my
lord,
I
pray
thee,
pass
over
before
his
servant:
and
I
will
lead
on
softly,
according
as
the
cattle
that
goeth
before
me
and
the
children
be
able
to
endure,
until
I
come
unto
my
lord
unto
Seir.
033:015
And
Esau
said,
Let
me
now
leave
with
thee
some
of
the
folk
that
are
with
me.
And
he
said,
What
needeth
it?
let
me
find
grace
in
the
sight
of
my
lord.
033:016
So
Esau
returned
that
day
on
his
way
unto
Seir.
033:017
And
Jacob
journeyed
to
Succoth,
and
built
him
an
house,
and
made
booths
for
his
cattle:
therefore
the
name
of
the
place
is
called
Succoth.
033:018
And
Jacob
came
to
Shalem,
a
city
of
Shechem,
which
is
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
when
he
came
from
Padanaram;
and
pitched
his
tent
before
the
city.
033:019
And
he
bought
a
parcel
of
a
field,
where
he
had
spread
his
tent,
at
the
hand
of
the
children
of
Hamor,
Shechem's
father,
for
an
hundred
pieces
of
money.
033:020
And
he
erected
there
an
altar,
and
called
it
EleloheIsrael.
034:001
And
Dinah
the
daughter
of
Leah,
which
she
bare
unto
Jacob,
went
out
to
see
the
daughters
of
the
land.
034:002
And
when
Shechem
the
son
of
Hamor
the
Hivite,
prince
of
the
country,
saw
her,
he
took
her,
and
lay
with
her,
and
defiled
her.
034:003
And
his
soul
clave
unto
Dinah
the
daughter
of
Jacob,
and
he
loved
the
damsel,
and
spake
kindly
unto
the
damsel.
034:004
And
Shechem
spake
unto
his
father
Hamor,
saying,
Get
me
this
damsel
to
wife.
034:005
And
Jacob
heard
that
he
had
defiled
Dinah
his
daughter:
now
his
sons
were
with
his
cattle
in
the
field:
and
Jacob
held
his
peace
until
they
were
come.
034:006
And
Hamor
the
father
of
Shechem
went
out
unto
Jacob
to
commune
with
him.
034:007
And
the
sons
of
Jacob
came
out
of
the
field
when
they
heard
it:
and
the
men
were
grieved,
and
they
were
very
wroth,
because
he
had
wrought
folly
in
Israel
in
lying
with
Jacob's
daughter:
which
thing
ought
not
to
be
done.
034:008
And
Hamor
communed
with
them,
saying,
The
soul
of
my
son
Shechem
longeth
for
your
daughter:
I
pray
you
give
her
him
to
wife.
034:009
And
make
ye
marriages
with
us,
and
give
your
daughters
unto
us,
and
take
our
daughters
unto
you.
034:010
And
ye
shall
dwell
with
us:
and
the
land
shall
be
before
you;
dwell
and
trade
ye
therein,
and
get
you
possessions
therein.
034:011
And
Shechem
said
unto
her
father
and
unto
her
brethren,
Let
me
find
grace
in
your
eyes,
and
what
ye
shall
say
unto
me
I
will
give.
034:012
Ask
me
never
so
much
dowry
and
gift,
and
I
will
give
according
as
ye
shall
say
unto
me:
but
give
me
the
damsel
to
wife.
034:013
And
the
sons
of
Jacob
answered
Shechem
and
Hamor
his
father
deceitfully,
and
said,
because
he
had
defiled
Dinah
their
sister:
034:014
And
they
said
unto
them,
We
cannot
do
this
thing,
to
give
our
sister
to
one
that
is
uncircumcised;
for
that
were
a
reproach
unto
us:
034:015
But
in
this
will
we
consent
unto
you:
If
ye
will
be
as
we
be,
that
every
male
of
you
be
circumcised;
034:016
Then
will
we
give
our
daughters
unto
you,
and
we
will
take
your
daughters
to
us,
and
we
will
dwell
with
you,
and
we
will
become
one
people.
034:017
But
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
us,
to
be
circumcised;
then
will
we
take
our
daughter,
and
we
will
be
gone.
034:018
And
their
words
pleased
Hamor,
and
Shechem
Hamor's
son.
034:019
And
the
young
man
deferred
not
to
do
the
thing,
because
he
had
delight
in
Jacob's
daughter:
and
he
was
more
honourable
than
all
the
house
of
his
father.
034:020
And
Hamor
and
Shechem
his
son
came
unto
the
gate
of
their
city,
and
communed
with
the
men
of
their
city,
saying,
034:021
These
men
are
peaceable
with
us;
therefore
let
them
dwell
in
the
land,
and
trade
therein;
for
the
land,
behold,
it
is
large
enough
for
them;
let
us
take
their
daughters
to
us
for
wives,
and
let
us
give
them
our
daughters.
034:022
Only
herein
will
the
men
consent
unto
us
for
to
dwell
with
us,
to
be
one
people,
if
every
male
among
us
be
circumcised,
as
they
are
circumcised.
034:023
Shall
not
their
cattle
and
their
substance
and
every
beast
of
their's
be
our's?
only
let
us
consent
unto
them,
and
they
will
dwell
with
us.
034:024
And
unto
Hamor
and
unto
Shechem
his
son
hearkened
all
that
went
out
of
the
gate
of
his
city;
and
every
male
was
circumcised,
all
that
went
out
of
the
gate
of
his
city.
034:025
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
day,
when
they
were
sore,
that
two
of
the
sons
of
Jacob,
Simeon
and
Levi,
Dinah's
brethren,
took
each
man
his
sword,
and
came
upon
the
city
boldly,
and
slew
all
the
males.
034:026
And
they
slew
Hamor
and
Shechem
his
son
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
took
Dinah
out
of
Shechem's
house,
and
went
out.
034:027
The
sons
of
Jacob
came
upon
the
slain,
and
spoiled
the
city,
because
they
had
defiled
their
sister.
034:028
They
took
their
sheep,
and
their
oxen,
and
their
asses,
and
that
which
was
in
the
city,
and
that
which
was
in
the
field,
034:029
And
all
their
wealth,
and
all
their
little
ones,
and
their
wives
took
they
captive,
and
spoiled
even
all
that
was
in
the
house.
034:030
And
Jacob
said
to
Simeon
and
Levi,
Ye
have
troubled
me
to
make
me
to
stink
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
land,
among
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites:
and
I
being
few
in
number,
they
shall
gather
themselves
together
against
me,
and
slay
me;
and
I
shall
be
destroyed,
I
and
my
house.
034:031
And
they
said,
Should
he
deal
with
our
sister
as
with
an
harlot?
035:001
And
God
said
unto
Jacob,
Arise,
go
up
to
Bethel,
and
dwell
there:
and
make
there
an
altar
unto
God,
that
appeared
unto
thee
when
thou
fleddest
from
the
face
of
Esau
thy
brother.
035:002
Then
Jacob
said
unto
his
household,
and
to
all
that
were
with
him,
Put
away
the
strange
gods
that
are
among
you,
and
be
clean,
and
change
your
garments:
035:003
And
let
us
arise,
and
go
up
to
Bethel;
and
I
will
make
there
an
altar
unto
God,
who
answered
me
in
the
day
of
my
distress,
and
was
with
me
in
the
way
which
I
went.
035:004
And
they
gave
unto
Jacob
all
the
strange
gods
which
were
in
their
hand,
and
all
their
earrings
which
were
in
their
ears;
and
Jacob
hid
them
under
the
oak
which
was
by
Shechem.
035:005
And
they
journeyed:
and
the
terror
of
God
was
upon
the
cities
that
were
round
about
them,
and
they
did
not
pursue
after
the
sons
of
Jacob.
035:006
So
Jacob
came
to
Luz,
which
is
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
that
is,
Bethel,
he
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him.
035:007
And
he
built
there
an
altar,
and
called
the
place
Elbethel:
because
there
God
appeared
unto
him,
when
he
fled
from
the
face
of
his
brother.
035:008
But
Deborah
Rebekah's
nurse
died,
and
she
was
buried
beneath
Bethel
under
an
oak:
and
the
name
of
it
was
called
Allonbachuth.
035:009
And
God
appeared
unto
Jacob
again,
when
he
came
out
of
Padanaram,
and
blessed
him.
035:010
And
God
said
unto
him,
Thy
name
is
Jacob:
thy
name
shall
not
be
called
any
more
Jacob,
but
Israel
shall
be
thy
name:
and
he
called
his
name
Israel.
035:011
And
God
said
unto
him,
I
am
God
Almighty:
be
fruitful
and
multiply;
a
nation
and
a
company
of
nations
shall
be
of
thee,
and
kings
shall
come
out
of
thy
loins;
035:012
And
the
land
which
I
gave
Abraham
and
Isaac,
to
thee
I
will
give
it,
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee
will
I
give
the
land.
035:013
And
God
went
up
from
him
in
the
place
where
he
talked
with
him.
035:014
And
Jacob
set
up
a
pillar
in
the
place
where
he
talked
with
him,
even
a
pillar
of
stone:
and
he
poured
a
drink
offering
thereon,
and
he
poured
oil
thereon.
035:015
And
Jacob
called
the
name
of
the
place
where
God
spake
with
him,
Bethel.
035:016
And
they
journeyed
from
Bethel;
and
there
was
but
a
little
way
to
come
to
Ephrath:
and
Rachel
travailed,
and
she
had
hard
labour.
035:017
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
she
was
in
hard
labour,
that
the
midwife
said
unto
her,
Fear
not;
thou
shalt
have
this
son
also.
035:018
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
her
soul
was
in
departing,
(for
she
died)
that
she
called
his
name
Benoni:
but
his
father
called
him
Benjamin.
035:019
And
Rachel
died,
and
was
buried
in
the
way
to
Ephrath,
which
is
Bethlehem.
035:020
And
Jacob
set
a
pillar
upon
her
grave:
that
is
the
pillar
of
Rachel's
grave
unto
this
day.
035:021
And
Israel
journeyed,
and
spread
his
tent
beyond
the
tower
of
Edar.
035:022
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Israel
dwelt
in
that
land,
that
Reuben
went
and
lay
with
Bilhah
his
father's
concubine:
and
Israel
heard
it.
Now
the
sons
of
Jacob
were
twelve:
035:023
The
sons
of
Leah;
Reuben,
Jacob's
firstborn,
and
Simeon,
and
Levi,
and
Judah,
and
Issachar,
and
Zebulun:
035:024
The
sons
of
Rachel;
Joseph,
and
Benjamin:
035:025
And
the
sons
of
Bilhah,
Rachel's
handmaid;
Dan,
and
Naphtali:
035:026
And
the
sons
of
Zilpah,
Leah's
handmaid:
Gad,
and
Asher:
these
are
the
sons
of
Jacob,
which
were
born
to
him
in
Padanaram.
035:027
And
Jacob
came
unto
Isaac
his
father
unto
Mamre,
unto
the
city
of
Arbah,
which
is
Hebron,
where
Abraham
and
Isaac
sojourned.
035:028
And
the
days
of
Isaac
were
an
hundred
and
fourscore
years.
035:029
And
Isaac
gave
up
the
ghost,
and
died,
and
was
gathered
unto
his
people,
being
old
and
full
of
days:
and
his
sons
Esau
and
Jacob
buried
him.
036:001
Now
these
are
the
generations
of
Esau,
who
is
Edom.
036:002
Esau
took
his
wives
of
the
daughters
of
Canaan;
Adah
the
daughter
of
Elon
the
Hittite,
and
Aholibamah
the
daughter
of
Anah
the
daughter
of
Zibeon
the
Hivite;
036:003
And
Bashemath
Ishmael's
daughter,
sister
of
Nebajoth.
036:004
And
Adah
bare
to
Esau
Eliphaz;
and
Bashemath
bare
Reuel;
036:005
And
Aholibamah
bare
Jeush,
and
Jaalam,
and
Korah:
these
are
the
sons
of
Esau,
which
were
born
unto
him
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
036:006
And
Esau
took
his
wives,
and
his
sons,
and
his
daughters,
and
all
the
persons
of
his
house,
and
his
cattle,
and
all
his
beasts,
and
all
his
substance,
which
he
had
got
in
the
land
of
Canaan;
and
went
into
the
country
from
the
face
of
his
brother
Jacob.
036:007
For
their
riches
were
more
than
that
they
might
dwell
together;
and
the
land
wherein
they
were
strangers
could
not
bear
them
because
of
their
cattle.
036:008
Thus
dwelt
Esau
in
mount
Seir:
Esau
is
Edom.
036:009
And
these
are
the
generations
of
Esau
the
father
of
the
Edomites
in
mount
Seir:
036:010
These
are
the
names
of
Esau's
sons;
Eliphaz
the
son
of
Adah
the
wife
of
Esau,
Reuel
the
son
of
Bashemath
the
wife
of
Esau.
036:011
And
the
sons
of
Eliphaz
were
Teman,
Omar,
Zepho,
and
Gatam,
and
Kenaz.
036:012
And
Timna
was
concubine
to
Eliphaz
Esau's
son;
and
she
bare
to
Eliphaz
Amalek:
these
were
the
sons
of
Adah
Esau's
wife.
036:013
And
these
are
the
sons
of
Reuel;
Nahath,
and
Zerah,
Shammah,
and
Mizzah:
these
were
the
sons
of
Bashemath
Esau's
wife.
036:014
And
these
were
the
sons
of
Aholibamah,
the
daughter
of
Anah
the
daughter
of
Zibeon,
Esau's
wife:
and
she
bare
to
Esau
Jeush,
and
Jaalam,
and
Korah.
036:015
These
were
dukes
of
the

of
Esau:
the
sons
of
Eliphaz
the
firstborn
son
of
Esau;
duke
Teman,
duke
Omar,
duke
Zepho,
duke
Kenaz,
036:016
Duke
Korah,
duke

and
duke

these
are
the
dukes
that
came
of
Eliphaz
in
the
land
of
Edom;
these
were
the
sons
of
Adah.
036:017
And
these
are
the
sons
of
Reuel
Esau's
son;
duke
Nahath,
duke
Zerah,
duke
Shammah,
duke
Mizzah:
these
are
the
dukes
that
came
of
Reuel
in
the
land
of
Edom;
these
are
the
sons
of
Bashemath
Esau's
wife.
036:018
And
these
are
the
sons
of
Aholibamah
Esau's
wife;
duke
Jeush,
duke
Jaalam,
duke
Korah:
these
were
the
dukes
that
came
of
Aholibamah
the
daughter
of
Anah,
Esau's
wife.
036:019
These
are
the
sons
of
Esau,
who
is
Edom,
and
these
are
their
dukes.
036:020
These
are
the
sons
of
Seir
the
Horite,
who
inhabited
the
land;
Lotan,
and
Shobal,
and
Zibeon,
and
Anah,
036:021
And
Dishon,
and
Ezer,
and
Dishan:
these
are
the
dukes
of
the
Horites,
the
children
of
Seir
in
the
land
of
Edom.
036:022
And
the
children
of
Lotan
were
Hori
and
Hemam;
and
Lotan's
sister
was
Timna.
036:023
And
the
children
of
Shobal
were
these;
Alvan,
and
Manahath,
and
Ebal,
Shepho,
and
Onam.
036:024
And
these
are
the
children
of
Zibeon;
both
Ajah,
and
Anah:
this
was
that
Anah
that
found
the
mules
in
the
wilderness,
as
he
fed
the
asses
of
Zibeon
his
father.
036:025
And
the
children
of
Anah
were
these;
Dishon,
and

the

of
Anah.
036:026
And
these

and

and

036:027
The

and

036:028
The

of
Dishan

036:029
These

duke
Zibeon,
duke
Anah,
036:030
Duke
Dishon,
duke
Ezer,
duke
Dishan:
these
are
the
dukes
that
came
of
Hori,
among
their
dukes
in
the
land
of
Seir.
036:031
And
these
are
the
kings
that
reigned
in
the
land
of
Edom,
before
there
reigned
any
king
over
the
children
of
Israel.
036:032
And
Bela
the
son
of
Beor
reigned
in
Edom:
and
the
name
of
his
city
was
Dinhabah.
036:033
And
Bela
died,
and
Jobab
the

of
Zerah
of
Bozrah
reigned
in
his
stead.
036:034
And

036:035
And

who
smote
Midian
in
the
field
of
Moab,

and
the
name
of
his
city
was
Avith.
036:036
And

died,
and

of
Masrekah
reigned
in
his
stead.
036:037
And
Samlah
died,
and
Saul
of
Rehoboth
by
the
river
reigned
in
his
stead.
036:038
And
Saul
died,
and
Baalhanan
the
son
of
Achbor
reigned
in
his
stead.
036:039
And
Baalhanan
the
son
of
Achbor
died,
and
Hadar
reigned
in
his
stead:
and
the
name
of
his
city
was
Pau;
and
his
wife's
name
was
Mehetabel,
the
daughter
of
Matred,
the
daughter
of
Mezahab.
036:040
And
these
are
the
names
of
the
dukes
that
came
of
Esau,
according
to
their
families,
after
their
places,
by
their
names;
duke
Timnah,
duke
Alvah,
duke
Jetheth,
036:041
Duke
Aholibamah,
duke
Elah,
duke
Pinon,
036:042
Duke
Kenaz,
duke
Teman,
duke
Mibzar,
036:043
Duke
Magdiel,
duke
Iram:
these
be
the
dukes
of
Edom,
according
to
their
habitations
in
the
land
of
their
possession:
he
is
Esau
the
father
of
the
Edomites.
037:001
And
Jacob
dwelt
in
the
land
wherein
his
father
was
a
stranger,
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
037:002
These
are
the
generations
of
Jacob.
Joseph,
being
seventeen
years
old,
was
feeding
the
flock
with
his
brethren;
and
the
lad
was
with
the
sons
of
Bilhah,
and
with
the
sons
of
Zilpah,
his
father's
wives:
and
Joseph
brought
unto
his
father
their
evil
report.
037:003
Now
Israel
loved
Joseph
more
than
all
his
children,
because
he
was
the
son
of
his
old
age:
and
he
made
him
a
coat
of
many
colours.
037:004
And
when
his
brethren
saw
that
their
father
loved
him
more
than
all
his
brethren,
they
hated
him,
and
could
not
speak
peaceably
unto
him.
037:005
And
Joseph
dreamed
a
dream,
and
he
told
it
his
brethren:
and
they
hated
him
yet
the
more.
037:006
And
he
said
unto
them,
Hear,
I
pray
you,
this
dream
which
I
have
dreamed:
037:007
For,
behold,
we
were
binding
sheaves
in
the
field,
and,
lo,
my
sheaf
arose,
and
also
stood
upright;
and,
behold,
your
sheaves
stood
round
about,
and
made
obeisance
to
my
sheaf.
037:008
And
his
brethren
said
to
him,
Shalt
thou
indeed
reign
over
us?
or
shalt
thou
indeed
have
dominion
over
us?
And
they
hated
him
yet
the
more
for
his
dreams,
and
for
his
words.
037:009
And
he
dreamed
yet
another
dream,
and
told
it
his
brethren,
and
said,
Behold,
I
have
dreamed
a
dream
more;
and,
behold,
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
eleven
stars
made
obeisance
to
me.
037:010
And
he
told
it
to
his
father,
and
to
his
brethren:
and
his
father
rebuked
him,
and
said
unto
him,
What
is
this
dream
that
thou
hast
dreamed?
Shall
I
and
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
indeed
come
to
bow
down
ourselves
to
thee
to
the
earth?
037:011
And
his
brethren
envied
him;
but
his
father
observed
the
saying.
037:012
And
his
brethren
went
to
feed
their
father's
flock
in
Shechem.
037:013
And
Israel
said
unto
Joseph,
Do
not
thy
brethren
feed
the
flock
in
Shechem?
come,
and
I
will
send
thee
unto
them.
And
he
said
to
him,
Here
am
I.
037:014
And
he
said
to
him,
Go,
I
pray
thee,
see
whether
it
be
well
with
thy
brethren,
and
well
with
the
flocks;
and
bring
me
word
again.
So
he
sent
him
out
of
the
vale
of
Hebron,
and
he
came
to
Shechem.
037:015
And
a
certain
man
found
him,
and,
behold,
he
was
wandering
in
the
field:
and
the
man
asked
him,
saying,
What
seekest
thou?
037:016
And
he
said,
I
seek
my
brethren:
tell
me,
I
pray
thee,
where
they
feed
their
flocks.
037:017
And
the
man
said,
They
are
departed
hence;
for
I
heard
them
say,
Let
us
go
to
Dothan.
And
Joseph
went
after
his
brethren,
and
found
them
in
Dothan.
037:018
And
when
they
saw
him
afar
off,
even
before
he
came
near
unto
them,
they
conspired
against
him
to
slay
him.
037:019
And
they
said
one
to
another,
Behold,
this
dreamer
cometh.
037:020
Come
now
therefore,
and
let
us
slay
him,
and
cast
him
into
some
pit,
and
we
will
say,
Some
evil
beast
hath
devoured
him:
and
we
shall
see
what
will
become
of
his
dreams.
037:021
And
Reuben
heard
it,
and
he
delivered
him
out
of
their
hands;
and
said,
Let
us
not
kill
him.
037:022
And
Reuben
said
unto
them,
Shed
no
blood,
but
cast
him
into
this
pit
that
is
in
the
wilderness,
and
lay
no
hand
upon
him;
that
he
might
rid
him
out
of
their
hands,
to
deliver
him
to
his
father
again.
037:023
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Joseph
was
come
unto
his
brethren,
that
they
stript
Joseph
out
of
his
coat,
his
coat
of
many
colours
that
was
on
him;
037:024
And
they
took
him,
and
cast
him
into
a
pit:
and
the
pit
was
empty,
there
was
no
water
in
it.
037:025
And
they
sat
down
to
eat
bread:
and
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
and
looked,
and,
behold,
a
company
of
Ishmeelites
came
from
Gilead
with
their
camels
bearing
spicery
and
balm
and
myrrh,
going
to
carry
it
down
to
Egypt.
037:026
And
Judah
said
unto
his
brethren,
What
profit
is
it
if
we
slay
our
brother,
and
conceal
his
blood?
037:027
Come,
and
let
us
sell
him
to
the
Ishmeelites,
and
let
not
our
hand
be
upon
him;
for
he
is
our
brother
and
our
flesh.
And
his
brethren
were
content.
037:028
Then
there
passed
by
Midianites
merchantmen;
and
they
drew
and
lifted
up
Joseph
out
of
the
pit,
and
sold
Joseph
to
the
Ishmeelites
for
twenty
pieces
of
silver:
and
they
brought
Joseph
into
Egypt.
037:029
And
Reuben
returned
unto
the
pit;
and,
behold,
Joseph
was
not
in
the
pit;
and
he
rent
his
clothes.
037:030
And
he
returned
unto
his
brethren,
and
said,
The
child
is
not;
and
I,
whither
shall
I
go?
037:031
And
they
took
Joseph's
coat,
and
killed
a
kid
of
the
goats,
and
dipped
the
coat
in
the
blood;
037:032
And
they
sent
the
coat
of
many
colours,
and
they
brought
it
to
their
father;
and
said,
This
have
we
found:
know
now
whether
it
be
thy
son's
coat
or
no.
