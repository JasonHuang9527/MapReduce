was
grieved
for
his
son.
019:003
And
the
people
gat
them
by
stealth
that
day
into
the
city,
as
people
being
ashamed
steal
away
when
they
flee
in
battle.
019:004
But
the
king
covered
his
face,
and
the
king
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
O
my
son
Absalom,
O
Absalom,
my
son,
my
son!
019:005
And
Joab
came
into
the
house
to
the
king,
and
said,
Thou
hast
shamed
this
day
the
faces
of
all
thy
servants,
which
this
day
have
saved
thy
life,
and
the
lives
of
thy
sons
and
of
thy
daughters,
and
the
lives
of
thy
wives,
and
the
lives
of
thy
concubines;
019:006
In
that
thou
lovest
thine
enemies,
and
hatest
thy
friends.
For
thou
hast
declared
this
day,
that
thou
regardest
neither
princes
nor
servants:
for
this
day
I
perceive,
that
if
Absalom
had
lived,
and
all
we
had
died
this
day,
then
it
had
pleased
thee
well.
019:007
Now
therefore
arise,
go
forth,
and
speak
comfortably
unto
thy
servants:
for
I
swear
by
the
LORD,
if
thou
go
not
forth,
there
will
not
tarry
one
with
thee
this
night:
and
that
will
be
worse
unto
thee
than
all
the
evil
that
befell
thee
from
thy
youth
until
now.
019:008
Then
the
king
arose,
and
sat
in
the
gate.
And
they
told
unto
all
the
people,
saying,
Behold,
the
king
doth
sit
in
the
gate.
And
all
the
people
came
before
the
king:
for
Israel
had
fled
every
man
to
his
tent.
019:009
And
all
the
people
were
at
strife
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
saying,
The
king
saved
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies,
and
he
delivered
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines;
and
now
he
is
fled
out
of
the
land
for
Absalom.
019:010
And
Absalom,
whom
we
anointed
over
us,
is
dead
in
battle.
Now
therefore
why
speak
ye
not
a
word
of
bringing
the
king
back?
019:011
And
king
David
sent
to
Zadok
and
to
Abiathar
the
priests,
saying,
Speak
unto
the
elders
of
Judah,
saying,
Why
are
ye
the
last
to
bring
the
king
back
to
his
house?
seeing
the
speech
of
all
Israel
is
come
to
the
king,
even
to
his
house.
019:012
Ye
are
my
brethren,
ye
are
my
bones
and
my
flesh:
wherefore
then
are
ye
the
last
to
bring
back
the
king?
019:013
And
say
ye
to
Amasa,
Art
thou
not
of
my
bone,
and
of
my
flesh?
God
do
so
to
me,
and
more
also,
if
thou
be
not
captain
of
the
host
before
me
continually
in
the
room
of
Joab.
019:014
And
he
bowed
the
heart
of
all
the
men
of
Judah,
even
as
the
heart
of
one
man;
so
that
they
sent
this
word
unto
the
king,
Return
thou,
and
all
thy
servants.
019:015
So
the
king
returned,
and
came
to
Jordan.
And
Judah
came
to
Gilgal,
to
go
to
meet
the
king,
to
conduct
the
king
over
Jordan.
019:016
And
Shimei
the
son
of
Gera,
a
Benjamite,
which
was
of
Bahurim,
hasted
and
came
down
with
the
men
of
Judah
to
meet
king
David.
019:017
And
there
were
a
thousand
men
of
Benjamin
with
him,
and
Ziba
the
servant
of
the
house
of
Saul,
and
his
fifteen
sons
and
his
twenty
servants
with
him;
and
they
went
over
Jordan
before
the
king.
019:018
And
there
went
over
a
ferry
boat
to
carry
over
the
king's
household,
and
to
do
what
he
thought
good.
And
Shimei
the
son
of
Gera
fell
down
before
the
king,
as
he
was
come
over
Jordan;
019:019
And
said
unto
the
king,
Let
not
my
lord
impute
iniquity
unto
me,
neither
do
thou
remember
that
which
thy
servant
did
perversely
the
day
that
my
lord
the
king
went
out
of
Jerusalem,
that
the
king
should
take
it
to
his
heart.
019:020
For
thy
servant
doth
know
that
I
have
sinned:
therefore,
behold,
I
am
come
the
first
this
day
of
all
the
house
of
Joseph
to
go
down
to
meet
my
lord
the
king.
019:021
But
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
answered
and
said,
Shall
not
Shimei
be
put
to
death
for
this,
because
he
cursed
the
LORD's
anointed?
019:022
And
David
said,
What
have
I
to
do
with
you,
ye
sons
of
Zeruiah,
that
ye
should
this
day
be
adversaries
unto
me?
shall
there
any
man
be
put
to
death
this
day
in
Israel?
for
do
not
I
know
that
I
am
this
day
king
over
Israel?
019:023
Therefore
the
king
said
unto
Shimei,
Thou
shalt
not
die.
And
the
king
sware
unto
him.
019:024
And
Mephibosheth
the
son
of
Saul
came
down
to
meet
the
king,
and
had
neither
dressed
his
feet,
nor
trimmed
his
beard,
nor
washed
his
clothes,
from
the
day
the
king
departed
until
the
day
he
came
again
in
peace.
019:025
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
was
come
to
Jerusalem
to
meet
the
king,
that
the
king
said
unto
him,
Wherefore
wentest
not
thou
with
me,
Mephibosheth?
019:026
And
he
answered,
My
lord,
O
king,
my
servant
deceived
me:
for
thy
servant
said,
I
will
saddle
me
an
ass,
that
I
may
ride
thereon,
and
go
to
the
king;
because
thy
servant
is
lame.
019:027
And
he
hath
slandered
thy
servant
unto
my
lord
the
king;
but
my
lord
the
king
is
as
an
angel
of
God:
do
therefore
what
is
good
in
thine
eyes.
019:028
For
all
of
my
father's
house
were
but
dead
men
before
my
lord
the
king:
yet
didst
thou
set
thy
servant
among
them
that
did
eat
at
thine
own
table.
What
right
therefore
have
I
yet
to
cry
any
more
unto
the
king?
019:029
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
Why
speakest
thou
any
more
of
thy
matters?
I
have
said,
Thou
and
Ziba
divide
the
land.
019:030
And
Mephibosheth
said
unto
the
king,
Yea,
let
him
take
all,
forasmuch
as
my
lord
the
king
is
come
again
in
peace
unto
his
own
house.
019:031
And
Barzillai
the
Gileadite
came
down
from
Rogelim,
and
went
over
Jordan
with
the
king,
to
conduct
him
over
Jordan.
019:032
Now
Barzillai
was
a
very
aged
man,
even
fourscore
years
old:
and
he
had
provided
the
king
of
sustenance
while
he
lay
at
Mahanaim;
for
he
was
a
very
great
man.
019:033
And
the
king
said
unto
Barzillai,
Come
thou
over
with
me,
and
I
will
feed
thee
with
me
in
Jerusalem.
019:034
And
Barzillai
said
unto
the
king,
How
long
have
I
to
live,
that
I
should
go
up
with
the
king
unto
Jerusalem?
019:035
I
am
this
day
fourscore
years
old:
and
can
I
discern
between
good
and
evil?
can
thy
servant
taste
what
I
eat
or
what
I
drink?
can
I
hear
any
more
the
voice
of
singing
men
and
singing
women?
wherefore
then
should
thy
servant
be
yet
a
burden
unto
my
lord
the
king?
019:036
Thy
servant
will
go
a
little
way
over
Jordan
with
the
king:
and
why
should
the
king
recompense
it
me
with
such
a
reward?
019:037
Let
thy
servant,
I
pray
thee,
turn
back
again,
that
I
may
die
in
mine
own
city,
and
be
buried
by
the
grave
of
my
father
and
of
my
mother.
But
behold
thy
servant
Chimham;
let
him
go
over
with
my
lord
the
king;
and
do
to
him
what
shall
seem
good
unto
thee.
019:038
And
the
king
answered,
Chimham
shall
go
over
with
me,
and
I
will
do
to
him
that
which
shall
seem
good
unto
thee:
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
require
of
me,
that
will
I
do
for
thee.
019:039
And
all
the
people
went
over
Jordan.
And
when
the
king
was
come
over,
the
king
kissed
Barzillai,
and
blessed
him;
and
he
returned
unto
his
own
place.
019:040
Then
the
king
went
on
to
Gilgal,
and
Chimham
went
on
with
him:
and
all
the
people
of
Judah
conducted
the
king,
and
also
half
the
people
of
Israel.
019:041
And,
behold,
all
the
men
of
Israel
came
to
the
king,
and
said
unto
the
king,
Why
have
our
brethren
the
men
of
Judah
stolen
thee
away,
and
have
brought
the
king,
and
his
household,
and
all
David's
men
with
him,
over
Jordan?
019:042
And
all
the
men
of
Judah
answered
the
men
of
Israel,
Because
the
king
is
near
of
kin
to
us:
wherefore
then
be
ye
angry
for
this
matter?
have
we
eaten
at
all
of
the
king's
cost?
or
hath
he
given
us
any
gift?
019:043
And
the
men
of
Israel
answered
the
men
of
Judah,
and
said,
We
have
ten
parts
in
the
king,
and
we
have
also
more
right
in
David
than
ye:
why
then
did
ye
despise
us,
that
our
advice
should
not
be
first
had
in
bringing
back
our
king?
And
the
words
of
the
men
of
Judah
were
fiercer
than
the
words
of
the
men
of
Israel.
020:001
And
there
happened
to
be
there
a
man
of
Belial,
whose
name
was
Sheba,
the
son
of
Bichri,
a
Benjamite:
and
he
blew
a
trumpet,
and
said,
We
have
no
part
in
David,
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the
son
of
Jesse:
every
man
to
his
tents,
O
Israel.
020:002
So
every
man
of
Israel
went
up
from
after
David,
and
followed
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri:
but
the
men
of
Judah
clave
unto
their
king,
from
Jordan
even
to
Jerusalem.
020:003
And
David
came
to
his
house
at
Jerusalem;
and
the
king
took
the
ten
women
his
concubines,
whom
he
had
left
to
keep
the
house,
and
put
them
in
ward,
and
fed
them,
but
went
not
in
unto
them.
So
they
were
shut
up
unto
the
day
of
their
death,
living
in
widowhood.
020:004
Then
said
the
king
to
Amasa,
Assemble
me
the
men
of
Judah
within
three
days,
and
be
thou
here
present.
020:005
So
Amasa
went
to
assemble
the
men
of
Judah:
but
he
tarried
longer
than
the
set
time
which
he
had
appointed
him.
020:006
And
David
said
to
Abishai,
Now
shall
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
do
us
more
harm
than
did
Absalom:
take
thou
thy
lord's
servants,
and
pursue
after
him,
lest
he
get
him
fenced
cities,
and
escape
us.
020:007
And
there
went
out
after
him
Joab's
men,
and
the
Cherethites,
and
the
Pelethites,
and
all
the
mighty
men:
and
they
went
out
of
Jerusalem,
to
pursue
after
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri.
020:008
When
they
were
at
the
great
stone
which
is
in
Gibeon,
Amasa
went
before
them.
And
Joab's
garment
that
he
had
put
on
was
girded
unto
him,
and
upon
it
a
girdle
with
a
sword
fastened
upon
his
loins
in
the
sheath
thereof;
and
as
he
went
forth
it
fell
out.
020:009
And
Joab
said
to
Amasa,
Art
thou
in
health,
my
brother?
And
Joab
took
Amasa
by
the
beard
with
the
right
hand
to
kiss
him.
020:010
But
Amasa
took
no
heed
to
the
sword
that
was
in
Joab's
hand:
so
he
smote
him
therewith
in
the
fifth
rib,
and
shed
out
his
bowels
to
the
ground,
and
struck
him
not
again;
and
he
died.
So
Joab
and
Abishai
his
brother
pursued
after
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri.
020:011
And
one
of
Joab's
men
stood
by
him,
and
said,
He
that
favoureth
Joab,
and
he
that
is
for
David,
let
him
go
after
Joab.
020:012
And
Amasa
wallowed
in
blood
in
the
midst
of
the
highway.
And
when
the
man
saw
that
all
the
people
stood
still,
he
removed
Amasa
out
of
the
highway
into
the
field,
and
cast
a
cloth
upon
him,
when
he
saw
that
every
one
that
came
by
him
stood
still.
020:013
When
he
was
removed
out
of
the
highway,
all
the
people
went
on
after
Joab,
to
pursue
after
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri.
020:014
And
he
went
through
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
unto
Abel,
and
to
Bethmaachah,
and
all
the
Berites:
and
they
were
gathered
together,
and
went
also
after
him.
020:015
And
they
came
and
besieged
him
in
Abel
of
Bethmaachah,
and
they
cast
up
a
bank
against
the
city,
and
it
stood
in
the
trench:
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
Joab
battered
the
wall,
to
throw
it
down.
020:016
Then
cried
a
wise
woman
out
of
the
city,
Hear,
hear;
say,
I
pray
you,
unto
Joab,
Come
near
hither,
that
I
may
speak
with
thee.
020:017
And
when
he
was
come
near
unto
her,
the
woman
said,
Art
thou
Joab?
And
he
answered,
I
am
he.
Then
she
said
unto
him,
Hear
the
words
of
thine
handmaid.
And
he
answered,
I
do
hear.
020:018
Then
she
spake,
saying,
They
were
wont
to
speak
in
old
time,
saying,
They
shall
surely
ask
counsel
at
Abel:
and
so
they
ended
the
matter.
020:019
I
am
one
of
them
that
are
peaceable
and
faithful
in
Israel:
thou
seekest
to
destroy
a
city
and
a
mother
in
Israel:
why
wilt
thou
swallow
up
the
inheritance
of
the
LORD?
020:020
And
Joab
answered
and
said,
Far
be
it,
far
be
it
from
me,
that
I
should
swallow
up
or
destroy.
020:021
The
matter
is
not
so:
but
a
man
of
mount
Ephraim,
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
by
name,
hath
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
king,
even
against
David:
deliver
him
only,
and
I
will
depart
from
the
city.
And
the
woman
said
unto
Joab,
Behold,
his
head
shall
be
thrown
to
thee
over
the
wall.
020:022
Then
the
woman
went
unto
all
the
people
in
her
wisdom.
And
they
cut
off
the
head
of
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri,
and
cast
it
out
to
Joab.
And
he
blew
a
trumpet,
and
they
retired
from
the
city,
every
man
to
his
tent.
And
Joab
returned
to
Jerusalem
unto
the
king.
020:023
Now
Joab
was
over
all
the
host
of
Israel:
and
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
over
the
Cherethites
and
over
the
Pelethites:
020:024
And
Adoram
was
over
the
tribute:
and
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Ahilud
was
recorder:
020:025
And
Sheva
was
scribe:
and
Zadok
and
Abiathar
were
the
priests:
020:026
And
Ira
also
the
Jairite
was
a
chief
ruler
about
David.
021:001
Then
there
was
a
famine
in
the
days
of
David
three
years,
year
after
year;
and
David
enquired
of
the
LORD.
And
the
LORD
answered,
It
is
for
Saul,
and
for
his
bloody
house,
because
he
slew
the
Gibeonites.
021:002
And
the
king
called
the
Gibeonites,
and
said
unto
them;
(now
the
Gibeonites
were
not
of
the
children
of
Israel,
but
of
the
remnant
of
the
Amorites;
and
the
children
of
Israel
had
sworn
unto
them:
and
Saul
sought
to
slay
them
in
his
zeal
to
the
children
of
Israel
and
Judah.)
021:003
Wherefore
David
said
unto
the
Gibeonites,
What
shall
I
do
for
you?
and
wherewith
shall
I
make
the
atonement,
that
ye
may
bless
the
inheritance
of
the
LORD?
021:004
And
the
Gibeonites
said
unto
him,
We
will
have
no
silver
nor
gold
of
Saul,
nor
of
his
house;
neither
for
us
shalt
thou
kill
any
man
in
Israel.
And
he
said,
What
ye
shall
say,
that
will
I
do
for
you.
021:005
And
they
answered
the
king,
The
man
that
consumed
us,
and
that
devised
against
us
that
we
should
be
destroyed
from
remaining
in
any
of
the
coasts
of
Israel,
021:006
Let
seven
men
of
his
sons
be
delivered
unto
us,
and
we
will
hang
them
up
unto
the
LORD
in
Gibeah
of
Saul,
whom
the
LORD
did
choose.
And
the
king
said,
I
will
give
them.
021:007
But
the
king
spared
Mephibosheth,
the
son
of
Jonathan
the
son
of
Saul,
because
of
the
LORD's
oath
that
was
between
them,
between
David
and
Jonathan
the
son
of
Saul.
021:008
But
the
king
took
the
two
sons
of
Rizpah
the
daughter
of
Aiah,
whom
she
bare
unto
Saul,
Armoni
and
Mephibosheth;
and
the
five
sons
of
Michal
the
daughter
of
Saul,
whom
she
brought
up
for
Adriel
the
son
of
Barzillai
the
Meholathite:
021:009
And
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
the
Gibeonites,
and
they
hanged
them
in
the
hill
before
the
LORD:
and
they
fell
all
seven
together,
and
were
put
to
death
in
the
days
of
harvest,
in
the
first
days,
in
the
beginning
of
barley
harvest.
021:010
And
Rizpah
the
daughter
of
Aiah
took
sackcloth,
and
spread
it
for
her
upon
the
rock,
from
the
beginning
of
harvest
until
water
dropped
upon
them
out
of
heaven,
and
suffered
neither
the
birds
of
the
air
to
rest
on
them
by
day,
nor
the
beasts
of
the
field
by
night.
021:011
And
it
was
told
David
what
Rizpah
the
daughter
of
Aiah,
the
concubine
of
Saul,
had
done.
021:012
And
David
went
and
took
the
bones
of
Saul
and
the
bones
of
Jonathan
his
son
from
the
men
of
Jabeshgilead,
which
had
stolen
them
from
the
street
of
Bethshan,
where
the
Philistines
had
hanged
them,
when
the
Philistines
had
slain
Saul
in
Gilboa:
021:013
And
he
brought
up
from
thence
the
bones
of
Saul
and
the
bones
of
Jonathan
his
son;
and
they
gathered
the
bones
of
them
that
were
hanged.
021:014
And
the
bones
of
Saul
and
Jonathan
his
son
buried
they
in
the
country
of
Benjamin
in
Zelah,
in
the
sepulchre
of
Kish
his
father:
and
they
performed
all
that
the
king
commanded.
And
after
that
God
was
intreated
for
the
land.
021:015
Moreover
the
Philistines
had
yet
war
again
with
Israel;
and
David
went
down,
and
his
servants
with
him,
and
fought
against
the
Philistines:
and
David
waxed
faint.
021:016
And
Ishbibenob,
which
was
of
the
sons
of
the
giant,
the
weight
of
whose
spear
weighed
three
hundred
shekels
of
brass
in
weight,
he
being
girded
with
a
new
sword,
thought
to
have
slain
David.
021:017
But
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
succoured
him,
and
smote
the
Philistine,
and
killed
him.
Then
the
men
of
David
sware
unto
him,
saying,
Thou
shalt
go
no
more
out
with
us
to
battle,
that
thou
quench
not
the
light
of
Israel.
021:018
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
there
was
again
a
battle
with
the
Philistines
at
Gob:
then
Sibbechai
the
Hushathite
slew
Saph,
which
was
of
the
sons
of
the
giant.
021:019
And
there
was
again
a
battle
in
Gob
with
the
Philistines,
where
Elhanan
the
son
of
Jaareoregim,
a
Bethlehemite,
slew
the
brother
of
Goliath
the
Gittite,
the
staff
of
whose
spear
was
like
a
weaver's
beam.
021:020
And
there
was
yet
a
battle
in
Gath,
where
was
a
man
of
great
stature,
that
had
on
every
hand
six
fingers,
and
on
every
foot
six
toes,
four
and
twenty
in
number;
and
he
also
was
born
to
the
giant.
021:021
And
when
he
defied
Israel,
Jonathan
the
son
of
Shimeah
the
brother
of
David
slew
him.
021:022
These
four
were
born
to
the
giant
in
Gath,
and
fell
by
the
hand
of
David,
and
by
the
hand
of
his
servants.
022:001
And
David
spake
unto
the
LORD
the
words
of
this
song
in
the
day
that
the
LORD
had
delivered
him
out
of
the
hand
of
all
his
enemies,
and
out
of
the
hand
of
Saul:
022:002
And
he
said,
The
LORD
is
my
rock,
and
my
fortress,
and
my
deliverer;
022:003
The
God
of
my
rock;
in
him
will
I
trust:
he
is
my
shield,
and
the
horn
of
my
salvation,
my
high
tower,
and
my
refuge,
my
saviour;
thou
savest
me
from
violence.
022:004
I
will
call
on
the
LORD,
who
is
worthy
to
be
praised:
so
shall
I
be
saved
from
mine
enemies.
022:005
When
the
waves
of
death
compassed
me,
the
floods
of
ungodly
men
made
me
afraid;
022:006
The
sorrows
of
hell
compassed
me
about;
the
snares
of
death
prevented
me;
022:007
In
my
distress
I
called
upon
the
LORD,
and
cried
to
my
God:
and
he
did
hear
my
voice
out
of
his
temple,
and
my
cry
did
enter
into
his
ears.
022:008
Then
the
earth
shook
and
trembled;
the
foundations
of
heaven
moved
and
shook,
because
he
was
wroth.
022:009
There
went
up
a
smoke
out
of
his
nostrils,
and
fire
out
of
his
mouth
devoured:
coals
were
kindled
by
it.
022:010
He
bowed
the
heavens
also,
and
came
down;
and
darkness
was
under
his
feet.
022:011
And
he
rode
upon
a
cherub,
and
did
fly:
and
he
was
seen
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind.
022:012
And
he
made
darkness
pavilions
round
about
him,
dark
waters,
and
thick
clouds
of
the
skies.
022:013
Through
the
brightness
before
him
were
coals
of
fire
kindled.
022:014
The
LORD
thundered
from
heaven,
and
the
most
High
uttered
his
voice.
022:015
And
he
sent
out
arrows,
and
scattered
them;
lightning,
and
discomfited
them.
022:016
And
the
channels
of
the
sea
appeared,
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
discovered,
at
the
rebuking
of
the
LORD,
at
the
blast
of
the
breath
of
his
nostrils.
022:017
He
sent
from
above,
he
took
me;
he
drew
me
out
of
many
waters;
022:018
He
delivered
me
from
my
strong
enemy,
and
from
them
that
hated
me:
for
they
were
too
strong
for
me.
022:019
They
prevented
me
in
the
day
of
my
calamity:
but
the
LORD
was
my
stay.
022:020
He
brought
me
forth
also
into
a
large
place:
he
delivered
me,
because
he
delighted
in
me.
022:021
The
LORD
rewarded
me
according
to
my
righteousness:
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
hath
he
recompensed
me.
022:022
For
I
have
kept
the
ways
of
the
LORD,
and
have
not
wickedly
departed
from
my
God.
022:023
For
all
his
judgments
were
before
me:
and
as
for
his
statutes,
I
did
not
depart
from
them.
022:024
I
was
also
upright
before
him,
and
have
kept
myself
from
mine
iniquity.
022:025
Therefore
the
LORD
hath
recompensed
me
according
to
my
righteousness;
according
to
my
cleanness
in
his
eye
sight.
022:026
With
the
merciful
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
merciful,
and
with
the
upright
man
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
upright.
022:027
With
the
pure
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
pure;
and
with
the
froward
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
unsavoury.
022:028
And
the
afflicted
people
thou
wilt
save:
but
thine
eyes
are
upon
the
haughty,
that
thou
mayest
bring
them
down.
022:029
For
thou
art
my
lamp,
O
LORD:
and
the
LORD
will
lighten
my
darkness.
022:030
For
by
thee
I
have
run
through
a
troop:
by
my
God
have
I
leaped
over
a
wall.
022:031
As
for
God,
his
way
is
perfect;
the
word
of
the
LORD
is
tried:
he
is
a
buckler
to
all
them
that
trust
in
him.
022:032
For
who
is
God,
save
the
LORD?
and
who
is
a
rock,
save
our
God?
022:033
God
is
my
strength
and
power:
and
he
maketh
my
way
perfect.
022:034
He
maketh
my
feet
like
hinds'
feet:
and
setteth
me
upon
my
high
places.
022:035
He
teacheth
my
hands
to
war;
so
that
a
bow
of
steel
is
broken
by
mine
arms.
022:036
Thou
hast
also
given
me
the
shield
of
thy
salvation:
and
thy
gentleness
hath
made
me
great.
022:037
Thou
hast
enlarged
my
steps
under
me;
so
that
my
feet
did
not
slip.
022:038
I
have
pursued
mine
enemies,
and
destroyed
them;
and
turned
not
again
until
I
had
consumed
them.
022:039
And
I
have
consumed
them,
and
wounded
them,
that
they
could
not
arise:
yea,
they
are
fallen
under
my
feet.
022:040
For
thou
hast
girded
me
with
strength
to
battle:
them
that
rose
up
against
me
hast
thou
subdued
under
me.
022:041
Thou
hast
also
given
me
the
necks
of
mine
enemies,
that
I
might
destroy
them
that
hate
me.
022:042
They
looked,
but
there
was
none
to
save;
even
unto
the
LORD,
but
he
answered
them
not.
022:043
Then
did
I
beat
them
as
small
as
the
dust
of
the
earth,
I
did
stamp
them
as
the
mire
of
the
street,
and
did
spread
them
abroad.
022:044
Thou
also
hast
delivered
me
from
the
strivings
of
my
people,
thou
hast
kept
me
to
be
head
of
the
heathen:
a
people
which
I
knew
not
shall
serve
me.
022:045
Strangers
shall
submit
themselves
unto
me:
as
soon
as
they
hear,
they
shall
be
obedient
unto
me.
022:046
Strangers
shall
fade
away,
and
they
shall
be
afraid
out
of
their
close
places.
022:047
The
LORD
liveth;
and
blessed
be
my
rock;
and
exalted
be
the
God
of
the
rock
of
my
salvation.
022:048
It
is
God
that
avengeth
me,
and
that
bringeth
down
the
people
under
me.
022:049
And
that
bringeth
me
forth
from
mine
enemies:
thou
also
hast
lifted
me
up
on
high
above
them
