that
rose
up
against
me:
thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
violent
man.
022:050
Therefore
I
will
give
thanks
unto
thee,
O
LORD,
among
the
heathen,
and
I
will
sing
praises
unto
thy
name.
022:051
He
is
the
tower
of
salvation
for
his
king:
and
sheweth
mercy
to
his
anointed,
unto
David,
and
to
his
seed
for
evermore.
023:001
Now
these
be
the
last
words
of
David.
David
the
son
of
Jesse
said,
and
the
man
who
was
raised
up
on
high,
the
anointed
of
the
God
of
Jacob,
and
the
sweet
psalmist
of
Israel,
said,
023:002
The
Spirit
of
the
LORD
spake
by
me,
and
his
word
was
in
my
tongue.
023:003
The
God
of
Israel
said,
the
Rock
of
Israel
spake
to
me,
He
that
ruleth
over
men
must
be
just,
ruling
in
the
fear
of
God.
023:004
And
he
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
morning,
when
the
sun
riseth,
even
a
morning
without
clouds;
as
the
tender
grass
springing
out
of
the
earth
by
clear
shining
after
rain.
023:005
Although
my
house
be
not
so
with
God;
yet
he
hath
made
with
me
an
everlasting
covenant,
ordered
in
all
things,
and
sure:
for
this
is
all
my
salvation,
and
all
my
desire,
although
he
make
it
not
to
grow.
023:006
But
the
sons
of
Belial
shall
be
all
of
them
as
thorns
thrust
away,
because
they
cannot
be
taken
with
hands:
023:007
But
the
man
that
shall
touch
them
must
be
fenced
with
iron
and
the
staff
of
a
spear;
and
they
shall
be
utterly
burned
with
fire
in
the
same
place.
023:008
These
be
the
names
of
the
mighty
men
whom
David
had:
The
Tachmonite
that
sat
in
the
seat,
chief
among
the
captains;
the
same
was
Adino
the
Eznite:
he
lift
up
his
spear
against
eight
hundred,
whom
he
slew
at
one
time.
023:009
And
after
him
was
Eleazar
the
son
of
Dodo
the
Ahohite,
one
of
the
three
mighty
men
with
David,
when
they
defied
the
Philistines
that
were
there
gathered
together
to
battle,
and
the
men
of
Israel
were
gone
away:
023:010
He
arose,
and
smote
the
Philistines
until
his
hand
was
weary,
and
his
hand
clave
unto
the
sword:
and
the
LORD
wrought
a
great
victory
that
day;
and
the
people
returned
after
him
only
to
spoil.
023:011
And
after
him
was
Shammah
the
son
of
Agee
the
Hararite.
And
the
Philistines
were
gathered
together
into
a
troop,
where
was
a
piece
of
ground
full
of
lentiles:
and
the
people
fled
from
the
Philistines.
023:012
But
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
ground,
and
defended
it,
and
slew
the
Philistines:
and
the
LORD
wrought
a
great
victory.
023:013
And
three
of
the
thirty
chief
went
down,
and
came
to
David
in
the
harvest
time
unto
the
cave
of
Adullam:
and
the
troop
of
the
Philistines
pitched
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
023:014
And
David
was
then
in
an
hold,
and
the
garrison
of
the
Philistines
was
then
in
Bethlehem.
023:015
And
David
longed,
and
said,
Oh
that
one
would
give
me
drink
of
the
water
of
the
well
of
Bethlehem,
which
is
by
the
gate!
023:016
And
the
three
mighty
men
brake
through
the
host
of
the
Philistines,
and
drew
water
out
of
the
well
of
Bethlehem,
that
was
by
the
gate,
and
took
it,
and
brought
it
to
David:
nevertheless
he
would
not
drink
thereof,
but
poured
it
out
unto
the
LORD.
023:017
And
he
said,
Be
it
far
from
me,
O
LORD,
that
I
should
do
this:
is
not
this
the
blood
of
the
men
that
went
in
jeopardy
of
their
lives?
therefore
he
would
not
drink
it.
These
things
did
these
three
mighty
men.
023:018
And
Abishai,
the
brother
of
Joab,
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
was
chief
among
three.
And
he
lifted
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred,
and
slew
them,
and
had
the
name
among
three.
023:019
Was
he
not
most
honourable
of
three?
therefore
he
was
their
captain:
howbeit
he
attained
not
unto
the
first
three.
023:020
And
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
the
son
of
a
valiant
man,
of
Kabzeel,
who
had
done
many
acts,
he
slew
two
lionlike
men
of
Moab:
he
went
down
also
and
slew
a
lion
in
the
midst
of
a
pit
in
time
of
snow:
023:021
And
he
slew
an
Egyptian,
a
goodly
man:
and
the
Egyptian
had
a
spear
in
his
hand;
but
he
went
down
to
him
with
a
staff,
and
plucked
the
spear
out
of
the
Egyptian's
hand,
and
slew
him
with
his
own
spear.
023:022
These
things
did
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
and
had
the
name
among
three
mighty
men.
023:023
He
was
more
honourable
than
the
thirty,
but
he
attained
not
to
the
first
three.
And
David
set
him
over
his
guard.
023:024
Asahel
the
brother
of
Joab
was
one
of
the
thirty;
Elhanan
the
son
of
Dodo
of
Bethlehem,
023:025
Shammah
the
Harodite,
Elika
the
Harodite,
023:026
Helez
the
Paltite,
Ira
the
son
of
Ikkesh
the
Tekoite,
023:027
Abiezer
the
Anethothite,
Mebunnai
the
Hushathite,
023:028
Zalmon
the
Ahohite,
Maharai
the
Netophathite,
023:029
Heleb
the
son
of
Baanah,
a
Netophathite,
Ittai
the
son
of
Ribai
out
of
Gibeah
of
the
children
of
Benjamin,
023:030
Benaiah
the
Pirathonite,
Hiddai
of
the
brooks
of
Gaash,
023:031
Abialbon
the
Arbathite,
Azmaveth
the
Barhumite,
023:032
Eliahba
the
Shaalbonite,
of
the
sons
of
Jashen,
Jonathan,
023:033
Shammah
the
Hararite,
Ahiam
the
son
of
Sharar
the
Hararite,
023:034
Eliphelet
the
son
of
Ahasbai,
the
son
of
the
Maachathite,
Eliam
the
son
of
Ahithophel
the
Gilonite,
023:035
Hezrai
the
Carmelite,
Paarai
the
Arbite,
023:036
Igal
the
son
of
Nathan
of
Zobah,
Bani
the
Gadite,
023:037
Zelek
the
Ammonite,
Nahari
the
Beerothite,
armourbearer
to
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
023:038
Ira
an
Ithrite,
Gareb
an
Ithrite,
023:039
Uriah
the
Hittite:
thirty
and
seven
in
all.
024:001
And
again
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Israel,
and
he
moved
David
against
them
to
say,
Go,
number
Israel
and
Judah.
024:002
For
the
king
said
to
Joab
the
captain
of
the
host,
which
was
with
him,
Go
now
through
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
from
Dan
even
to
Beersheba,
and
number
ye
the
people,
that
I
may
know
the
number
of
the
people.
024:003
And
Joab
said
unto
the
king,
Now
the
LORD
thy
God
add
unto
the
people,
how
many
soever
they
be,
an
hundredfold,
and
that
the
eyes
of
my
lord
the
king
may
see
it:
but
why
doth
my
lord
the
king
delight
in
this
thing?
024:004
Notwithstanding
the
king's
word
prevailed
against
Joab,
and
against
the
captains
of
the
host.
And
Joab
and
the
captains
of
the
host
went
out
from
the
presence
of
the
king,
to
number
the
people
of
Israel.
024:005
And
they
passed
over
Jordan,
and
pitched
in
Aroer,
on
the
right
side
of
the
city
that
lieth
in
the
midst
of
the
river
of
Gad,
and
toward
Jazer:
024:006
Then
they
came
to
Gilead,
and
to
the
land
of
Tahtimhodshi;
and
they
came
to
Danjaan,
and
about
to
Zidon,
024:007
And
came
to
the
strong
hold
of
Tyre,
and
to
all
the
cities
of
the
Hivites,
and
of
the
Canaanites:
and
they
went
out
to
the
south
of
Judah,
even
to
Beersheba.
024:008
So
when
they
had
gone
through
all
the
land,
they
came
to
Jerusalem
at
the
end
of
nine
months
and
twenty
days.
024:009
And
Joab
gave
up
the
sum
of
the
number
of
the
people
unto
the
king:
and
there
were
in
Israel
eight
hundred
thousand
valiant
men
that
drew
the
sword;
and
the
men
of
Judah
were
five
hundred
thousand
men.
024:010
And
David's
heart
smote
him
after
that
he
had
numbered
the
people.
And
David
said
unto
the
LORD,
I
have
sinned
greatly
in
that
I
have
done:
and
now,
I
beseech
thee,
O
LORD,
take
away
the
iniquity
of
thy
servant;
for
I
have
done
very
foolishly.
024:011
For
when
David
was
up
in
the
morning,
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
the
prophet
Gad,
David's
seer,
saying,
024:012
Go
and
say
unto
David,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
I
offer
thee
three
things;
choose
thee
one
of
them,
that
I
may
do
it
unto
thee.
024:013
So
Gad
came
to
David,
and
told
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Shall
seven
years
of
famine
come
unto
thee
in
thy
land?
or
wilt
thou
flee
three
months
before
thine
enemies,
while
they
pursue
thee?
or
that
there
be
three
days'
pestilence
in
thy
land?
now
advise,
and
see
what
answer
I
shall
return
to
him
that
sent
me.
024:014
And
David
said
unto
Gad,
I
am
in
a
great
strait:
let
us
fall
now
into
the
hand
of
the
LORD;
for
his
mercies
are
great:
and
let
me
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
man.
024:015
So
the
LORD
sent
a
pestilence
upon
Israel
from
the
morning
even
to
the
time
appointed:
and
there
died
of
the
people
from
Dan
even
to
Beersheba
seventy
thousand
men.
024:016
And
when
the
angel
stretched
out
his
hand
upon
Jerusalem
to
destroy
it,
the
LORD
repented
him
of
the
evil,
and
said
to
the
angel
that
destroyed
the
people,
It
is
enough:
stay
now
thine
hand.
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
was
by
the
threshingplace
of
Araunah
the
Jebusite.
024:017
And
David
spake
unto
the
LORD
when
he
saw
the
angel
that
smote
the
people,
and
said,
Lo,
I
have
sinned,
and
I
have
done
wickedly:
but
these
sheep,
what
have
they
done?
let
thine
hand,
I
pray
thee,
be
against
me,
and
against
my
father's
house.
024:018
And
Gad
came
that
day
to
David,
and
said
unto
him,
Go
up,
rear
an
altar
unto
the
LORD
in
the
threshingfloor
of
Araunah
the
Jebusite.
024:019
And
David,
according
to
the
saying
of
Gad,
went
up
as
the
LORD
commanded.
024:020
And
Araunah
looked,
and
saw
the
king
and
his
servants
coming
on
toward
him:
and
Araunah
went
out,
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
on
his
face
upon
the
ground.
024:021
And
Araunah
said,
Wherefore
is
my
lord
the
king
come
to
his
servant?
And
David
said,
To
buy
the
threshingfloor
of
thee,
to
build
an
altar
unto
the
LORD,
that
the
plague
may
be
stayed
from
the
people.
024:022
And
Araunah
said
unto
David,
Let
my
lord
the
king
take
and
offer
up
what
seemeth
good
unto
him:
behold,
here
be
oxen
for
burnt
sacrifice,
and
threshing
instruments
and
other
instruments
of
the
oxen
for
wood.
024:023
All
these
things
did
Araunah,
as
a
king,
give
unto
the
king.
And
Araunah
said
unto
the
king,
The
LORD
thy
God
accept
thee.
024:024
And
the
king
said
unto
Araunah,
Nay;
but
I
will
surely
buy
it
of
thee
at
a
price:
neither
will
I
offer
burnt
offerings
unto
the
LORD
my
God
of
that
which
doth
cost
me
nothing.
So
David
bought
the
threshingfloor
and
the
oxen
for
fifty
shekels
of
silver.
024:025
And
David
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
LORD,
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings.
So
the
LORD
was
intreated
for
the
land,
and
the
plague
was
stayed
from
Israel.
Book
11	1
Kings
001:001
Now
king
David
was
old
and
stricken
in
years;
and
they
covered
him
with
clothes,
but
he
gat
no
heat.
001:002
Wherefore
his
servants
said
unto
him,
Let
there
be
sought
for
my
lord
the
king
a
young
virgin:
and
let
her
stand
before
the
king,
and
let
her
cherish
him,
and
let
her
lie
in
thy
bosom,
that
my
lord
the
king
may
get
heat.
001:003
So
they
sought
for
a
fair
damsel
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
Israel,
and
found
Abishag
a
Shunammite,
and
brought
her
to
the
king.
001:004
And
the
damsel
was
very
fair,
and
cherished
the
king,
and
ministered
to
him:
but
the
king
knew
her
not.
001:005
Then
Adonijah
the
son
of
Haggith
exalted
himself,
saying,
I
will
be
king:
and
he
prepared
him
chariots
and
horsemen,
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
him.
001:006
And
his
father
had
not
displeased
him
at
any
time
in
saying,
Why
hast
thou
done
so?
and
he
also
was
a
very
goodly
man;
and
his
mother
bare
him
after
Absalom.
001:007
And
he
conferred
with
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
and
with
Abiathar
the
priest:
and
they
following
Adonijah
helped
him.
001:008
But
Zadok
the
priest,
and
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
and
Nathan
the
prophet,
and
Shimei,
and
Rei,
and
the
mighty
men
which
belonged
to
David,
were
not
with
Adonijah.
001:009
And
Adonijah
slew
sheep
and
oxen
and
fat
cattle
by
the
stone
of
Zoheleth,
which
is
by
Enrogel,
and
called
all
his
brethren
the
king's
sons,
and
all
the
men
of
Judah
the
king's
servants:
001:010
But
Nathan
the
prophet,
and
Benaiah,
and
the
mighty
men,
and
Solomon
his
brother,
he
called
not.
001:011
Wherefore
Nathan
spake
unto
Bathsheba
the
mother
of
Solomon,
saying,
Hast
thou
not
heard
that
Adonijah
the
son
of
Haggith
doth
reign,
and
David
our
lord
knoweth
it
not?
001:012
Now
therefore
come,
let
me,
I
pray
thee,
give
thee
counsel,
that
thou
mayest
save
thine
own
life,
and
the
life
of
thy
son
Solomon.
001:013
Go
and
get
thee
in
unto
king
David,
and
say
unto
him,
Didst
not
thou,
my
lord,
O
king,
swear
unto
thine
handmaid,
saying,
Assuredly
Solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me,
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne?
why
then
doth
Adonijah
reign?
001:014
Behold,
while
thou
yet
talkest
there
with
the
king,
I
also
will
come
in
after
thee,
and
confirm
thy
words.
001:015
And
Bathsheba
went
in
unto
the
king
into
the
chamber:
and
the
king
was
very
old;
and
Abishag
the
Shunammite
ministered
unto
the
king.
001:016
And
Bathsheba
bowed,
and
did
obeisance
unto
the
king.
And
the
king
said,
What
wouldest
thou?
001:017
And
she
said
unto
him,
My
lord,
thou
swarest
by
the
LORD
thy
God
unto
thine
handmaid,
saying,
Assuredly
Solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me,
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne.
001:018
And
now,
behold,
Adonijah
reigneth;
and
now,
my
lord
the
king,
thou
knowest
it
not:
001:019
And
he
hath
slain
oxen
and
fat
cattle
and
sheep
in
abundance,
and
hath
called
all
the
sons
of
the
king,
and
Abiathar
the
priest,
and
Joab
the
captain
of
the
host:
but
Solomon
thy
servant
hath
he
not
called.
001:020
And
thou,
my
lord,
O
king,
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
are
upon
thee,
that
thou
shouldest
tell
them
who
shall
sit
on
the
throne
of
my
lord
the
king
after
him.
001:021
Otherwise
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
my
lord
the
king
shall
sleep
with
his
fathers,
that
I
and
my
son
Solomon
shall
be
counted
offenders.
001:022
And,
lo,
while
she
yet
talked
with
the
king,
Nathan
the
prophet
also
came
in.
001:023
And
they
told
the
king,
saying,
Behold
Nathan
the
prophet.
And
when
he
was
come
in
before
the
king,
he
bowed
himself
before
the
king
with
his
face
to
the
ground.
001:024
And
Nathan
said,
My
lord,
O
king,
hast
thou
said,
Adonijah
shall
reign
after
me,
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne?
001:025
For
he
is
gone
down
this
day,
and
hath
slain
oxen
and
fat
cattle
and
sheep
in
abundance,
and
hath
called
all
the
king's
sons,
and
the
captains
of
the
host,
and
Abiathar
the
priest;
and,
behold,
they
eat
and
drink
before
him,
and
say,
God
save
king
Adonijah.
001:026
But
me,
even
me
thy
servant,
and
Zadok
the
priest,
and
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
and
thy
servant
Solomon,
hath
he
not
called.
001:027
Is
this
thing
done
by
my
lord
the
king,
and
thou
hast
not
shewed
it
unto
thy
servant,
who
should
sit
on
the
throne
of
my
lord
the
king
after
him?
001:028
Then
king
David
answered
and
said,
Call
me
Bathsheba.
And
she
came
into
the
king's
presence,
and
stood
before
the
king.
001:029
And
the
king
sware,
and
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
that
hath
redeemed
my
soul
out
of
all
distress,
001:030
Even
as
I
sware
unto
thee
by
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
saying,
Assuredly
Solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me,
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
in
my
stead;
even
so
will
I
certainly
do
this
day.
001:031
Then
Bathsheba
bowed
with
her
face
to
the
earth,
and
did
reverence
to
the
king,
and
said,
Let
my
lord
king
David
live
for
ever.
001:032
And
king
David
said,
Call
me
Zadok
the
priest,
and
Nathan
the
prophet,
and
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada.
And
they
came
before
the
king.
001:033
The
king
also
said
unto
them,
Take
with
you
the
servants
of
your
lord,
and
cause
Solomon
my
son
to
ride
upon
mine
own
mule,
and
bring
him
down
to
Gihon:
001:034
And
let
Zadok
the
priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
anoint
him
there
king
over
Israel:
and
blow
ye
with
the
trumpet,
and
say,
God
save
king
Solomon.
001:035
Then
ye
shall
come
up
after
him,
that
he
may
come
and
sit
upon
my
throne;
for
he
shall
be
king
in
my
stead:
and
I
have
appointed
him
to
be
ruler
over
Israel
and
over
Judah.
001:036
And
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
answered
the
king,
and
said,
Amen:
the
LORD
God
of
my
lord
the
king
say
so
too.
001:037
As
the
LORD
hath
been
with
my
lord
the
king,
even
so
be
he
with
Solomon,
and
make
his
throne
greater
than
the
throne
of
my
lord
king
David.
001:038
So
Zadok
the
priest,
and
Nathan
the
prophet,
and
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
and
the
Cherethites,
and
the
Pelethites,
went
down,
and
caused
Solomon
to
ride
upon
king
David's
mule,
and
brought
him
to
Gihon.
001:039
And
Zadok
the
priest
took
an
horn
of
oil
out
of
the
tabernacle,
and
anointed
Solomon.
And
they
blew
the
trumpet;
and
all
the
people
said,
God
save
king
Solomon.
001:040
And
all
the
people
came
up
after
him,
and
the
people
piped
with
pipes,
and
rejoiced
with
great
joy,
so
that
the
earth
rent
with
the
sound
of
them.
001:041
And
Adonijah
and
all
the
guests
that
were
with
him
heard
it
as
they
had
made
an
end
of
eating.
And
when
Joab
heard
the
sound
of
the
trumpet,
he
said,
Wherefore
is
this
noise
of
the
city
being
in
an
uproar?
001:042
And
while
he
yet
spake,
behold,
Jonathan
the
son
of
Abiathar
the
priest
came;
and
Adonijah
said
unto
him,
Come
in;
for
thou
art
a
valiant
man,
and
bringest
good
tidings.
001:043
And
Jonathan
answered
and
said
to
Adonijah,
Verily
our
lord
king
David
hath
made
Solomon
king.
001:044
And
the
king
hath
sent
with
him
Zadok
the
priest,
and
Nathan
the
prophet,
and
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
and
the
Cherethites,
and
the
Pelethites,
and
they
have
caused
him
to
ride
upon
the
king's
mule:
001:045
And
Zadok
the
priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
have
anointed
him
king
in
Gihon:
and
they
are
come
up
from
thence
rejoicing,
so
that
the
city
rang
again.
This
is
the
noise
that
ye
have
heard.
001:046
And
also
Solomon
sitteth
on
the
throne
of
the
kingdom.
001:047
And
moreover
the
king's
servants
came
to
bless
our
lord
king
David,
saying,
God
make
the
name
of
Solomon
better
than
thy
name,
and
make
his
throne
greater
than
thy
throne.
And
the
king
bowed
himself
upon
the
bed.
001:048
And
also
thus
said
the
king,
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
which
hath
given
one
to
sit
on
my
throne
this
day,
mine
eyes
even
seeing
it.
001:049
And
all
the
guests
that
were
with
Adonijah
were
afraid,
and
rose
up,
and
went
every
man
his
way.
001:050
And
Adonijah
feared
because
of
Solomon,
and
arose,
and
went,
and
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar.
001:051
And
it
was
told
Solomon,
saying,
Behold,
Adonijah
feareth
king
Solomon:
for,
lo,
he
hath
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar,
saying,
Let
king
Solomon
swear
unto
me
today
that
he
will
not
slay
his
servant
with
the
sword.
001:052
And
Solomon
said,
If
he
will
shew
himself
a
worthy
man,
there
shall
not
an
hair
of
him
fall
to
the
earth:
but
if
wickedness
shall
be
found
in
him,
he
shall
die.
001:053
So
king
Solomon
sent,
and
they
brought
him
down
from
the
altar.
And
he
came
and
bowed
himself
to
king
Solomon:
and
Solomon
said
unto
him,
Go
to
thine
house.
002:001
Now
the
days
of
David
drew
nigh
that
he
should
die;
and
he
charged
Solomon
his
son,
saying,
002:002
I
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth:
be
thou
strong
therefore,
and
shew
thyself
a
man;
002:003
And
keep
the
charge
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
to
walk
in
his
ways,
to
keep
his
statutes,
and
his
commandments,
and
his
judgments,
and
his
testimonies,
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
Moses,
that
thou
mayest
prosper
in
all
that
thou
doest,
and
whithersoever
thou
turnest
thyself:
002:004
That
the
LORD
may
continue
his
word
which
he
spake
concerning
me,
saying,
If
thy
children
take
heed
to
their
way,
to
walk
before
me
in
truth
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul,
there
shall
not
fail
thee
(said
he)
a
man
on
the
throne
of
Israel.
002:005
Moreover
thou
knowest
also
what
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
did
to
me,
and
what
he
did
to
the
two
captains
of
the
hosts
of
Israel,
unto
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
and
unto
Amasa
the
son
of
Jether,
whom
he
slew,
and
shed
the
blood
of
war
in
peace,
and
put
the
blood
of
war
upon
his
girdle
that
was
about
his
loins,
and
in
his
shoes
that
were
on
his
feet.
002:006
Do
therefore
according
to
thy
wisdom,
and
let
not
his
hoar
head
go
down
to
the
grave
in
peace.
002:007
But
shew
kindness
unto
the
sons
of
Barzillai
the
Gileadite,
and
let
them
be
of
those
that
eat
at
thy
table:
for
so
they
came
to
me
when
I
fled
because
of
Absalom
thy
brother.
002:008
And,
behold,
thou
hast
with
thee
Shimei
the
son
of
Gera,
a
Benjamite
of
Bahurim,
which
cursed
me
with
a
grievous
curse
in
the
day
when
I
went
to
Mahanaim:
but
he
came
down
to
meet
me
at
Jordan,
and
I
sware
to
him
by
the
LORD,
saying,
I
will
not
put
thee
to
death
with
the
sword.
002:009
Now
therefore
hold
him
not
guiltless:
for
thou
art
a
wise
man,
and
knowest
what
thou
oughtest
to
do
unto
him;
but
his
hoar
head
bring
thou
down
to
the
grave
with
blood.
002:010
So
David
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
David.
002:011
And
the
days
that
David
reigned
over
Israel
were
forty
years:
seven
years
reigned
he
in
Hebron,
and
thirty
and
three
years
reigned
he
in
Jerusalem.
002:012
Then
sat
Solomon
upon
the
throne
of
David
his
father;
and
his
kingdom
was
established
greatly.
002:013
And
Adonijah
the
son
of
Haggith
came
to
Bathsheba
the
mother
of
Solomon.
And
she
said,
Comest
thou
peaceably?
And
he
said,
Peaceably.
002:014
He
said
moreover,
I
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
thee.
And
she
said,
Say
on.
002:015
And
he
said,
Thou
knowest
that
the
kingdom
was
mine,
and
that
all
Israel
set
their
faces
on
me,
that
I
should
reign:
howbeit
the
kingdom
is
turned
about,
and
is
become
my
brother's:
for
it
was
his
from
the
LORD.
002:016
And
now
I
ask
one
petition
of
thee,
deny
me
not.
And
she
said
unto
him,
Say
on.
002:017
And
he
said,
Speak,
I
pray
thee,
unto
Solomon
the
king,
(for
he
will
not
say
thee
nay,)
that
he
give
me
Abishag
the
Shunammite
to
wife.
002:018
And
Bathsheba
said,
Well;
I
will
speak
for
thee
unto
the
king.
002:019
Bathsheba
therefore
went
unto
king
Solomon,
to
speak
unto
him
for
Adonijah.
And
the
king
rose
up
to
meet
her,
and
bowed
himself
unto
her,
and
sat
down
on
his
throne,
and
caused
a
seat
to
be
set
for
the
king's
mother;
and
she
sat
on
his
right
hand.
002:020
Then
she
said,
I
desire
one
small
petition
of
thee;
I
pray
thee,
say
me
not
nay.
And
the
king
said
unto
her,
Ask
on,
my
mother:
for
I
will
not
say
thee
nay.
002:021
And
she
said,
Let
Abishag
the
Shunammite
be
given
to
Adonijah
thy
brother
to
wife.
002:022
And
king
Solomon
answered
and
said
unto
his
mother,
And
why
dost
thou
ask
Abishag
the
Shunammite
for
Adonijah?
ask
for
