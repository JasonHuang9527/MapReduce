him
the
kingdom
also;
for
he
is
mine
elder
brother;
even
for
him,
and
for
Abiathar
the
priest,
and
for
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah.
002:023
Then
king
Solomon
sware
by
the
LORD,
saying,
God
do
so
to
me,
and
more
also,
if
Adonijah
have
not
spoken
this
word
against
his
own
life.
002:024
Now
therefore,
as
the
LORD
liveth,
which
hath
established
me,
and
set
me
on
the
throne
of
David
my
father,
and
who
hath
made
me
an
house,
as
he
promised,
Adonijah
shall
be
put
to
death
this
day.
002:025
And
king
Solomon
sent
by
the
hand
of
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada;
and
he
fell
upon
him
that
he
died.
002:026
And
unto
Abiathar
the
priest
said
the
king,
Get
thee
to
Anathoth,
unto
thine
own
fields;
for
thou
art
worthy
of
death:
but
I
will
not
at
this
time
put
thee
to
death,
because
thou
barest
the
ark
of
the
LORD
God
before
David
my
father,
and
because
thou
hast
been
afflicted
in
all
wherein
my
father
was
afflicted.
002:027
So
Solomon
thrust
out
Abiathar
from
being
priest
unto
the
LORD;
that
he
might
fulfil
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
concerning
the
house
of
Eli
in
Shiloh.
002:028
Then
tidings
came
to
Joab:
for
Joab
had
turned
after
Adonijah,
though
he
turned
not
after
Absalom.
And
Joab
fled
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD,
and
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar.
002:029
And
it
was
told
king
Solomon
that
Joab
was
fled
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD;
and,
behold,
he
is
by
the
altar.
Then
Solomon
sent
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
saying,
Go,
fall
upon
him.
002:030
And
Benaiah
came
to
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD,
and
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
king,
Come
forth.
And
he
said,
Nay;
but
I
will
die
here.
And
Benaiah
brought
the
king
word
again,
saying,
Thus
said
Joab,
and
thus
he
answered
me.
002:031
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
Do
as
he
hath
said,
and
fall
upon
him,
and
bury
him;
that
thou
mayest
take
away
the
innocent
blood,
which
Joab
shed,
from
me,
and
from
the
house
of
my
father.
002:032
And
the
LORD
shall
return
his
blood
upon
his
own
head,
who
fell
upon
two
men
more
righteous
and
better
than
he,
and
slew
them
with
the
sword,
my
father
David
not
knowing
thereof,
to
wit,
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
captain
of
the
host
of
Israel,
and
Amasa
the
son
of
Jether,
captain
of
the
host
of
Judah.
002:033
Their
blood
shall
therefore
return
upon
the
head
of
Joab,
and
upon
the
head
of
his
seed
for
ever:
but
upon
David,
and
upon
his
seed,
and
upon
his
house,
and
upon
his
throne,
shall
there
be
peace
for
ever
from
the
LORD.
002:034
So
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
went
up,
and
fell
upon
him,
and
slew
him:
and
he
was
buried
in
his
own
house
in
the
wilderness.
002:035
And
the
king
put
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
in
his
room
over
the
host:
and
Zadok
the
priest
did
the
king
put
in
the
room
of
Abiathar.
002:036
And
the
king
sent
and
called
for
Shimei,
and
said
unto
him,
Build
thee
an
house
in
Jerusalem,
and
dwell
there,
and
go
not
forth
thence
any
whither.
002:037
For
it
shall
be,
that
on
the
day
thou
goest
out,
and
passest
over
the
brook
Kidron,
thou
shalt
know
for
certain
that
thou
shalt
surely
die:
thy
blood
shall
be
upon
thine
own
head.
002:038
And
Shimei
said
unto
the
king,
The
saying
is
good:
as
my
lord
the
king
hath
said,
so
will
thy
servant
do.
And
Shimei
dwelt
in
Jerusalem
many
days.
002:039
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
three
years,
that
two
of
the
servants
of
Shimei
ran
away
unto
Achish
son
of
Maachah
king
of
Gath.
And
they
told
Shimei,
saying,
Behold,
thy
servants
be
in
Gath.
002:040
And
Shimei
arose,
and
saddled
his
ass,
and
went
to
Gath
to
Achish
to
seek
his
servants:
and
Shimei
went,
and
brought
his
servants
from
Gath.
002:041
And
it
was
told
Solomon
that
Shimei
had
gone
from
Jerusalem
to
Gath,
and
was
come
again.
002:042
And
the
king
sent
and
called
for
Shimei,
and
said
unto
him,
Did
I
not
make
thee
to
swear
by
the
LORD,
and
protested
unto
thee,
saying,
Know
for
a
certain,
on
the
day
thou
goest
out,
and
walkest
abroad
any
whither,
that
thou
shalt
surely
die?
and
thou
saidst
unto
me,
The
word
that
I
have
heard
is
good.
002:043
Why
then
hast
thou
not
kept
the
oath
of
the
LORD,
and
the
commandment
that
I
have
charged
thee
with?
002:044
The
king
said
moreover
to
Shimei,
Thou
knowest
all
the
wickedness
which
thine
heart
is
privy
to,
that
thou
didst
to
David
my
father:
therefore
the
LORD
shall
return
thy
wickedness
upon
thine
own
head;
002:045
And
king
Solomon
shall
be
blessed,
and
the
throne
of
David
shall
be
established
before
the
LORD
for
ever.
002:046
So
the
king
commanded
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada;
which
went
out,
and
fell
upon
him,
that
he
died.
And
the
kingdom
was
established
in
the
hand
of
Solomon.
003:001
And
Solomon
made
affinity
with
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
and
took
Pharaoh's
daughter,
and
brought
her
into
the
city
of
David,
until
he
had
made
an
end
of
building
his
own
house,
and
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
round
about.
003:002
Only
the
people
sacrificed
in
high
places,
because
there
was
no
house
built
unto
the
name
of
the
LORD,
until
those
days.
003:003
And
Solomon
loved
the
LORD,
walking
in
the
statutes
of
David
his
father:
only
he
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
high
places.
003:004
And
the
king
went
to
Gibeon
to
sacrifice
there;
for
that
was
the
great
high
place:
a
thousand
burnt
offerings
did
Solomon
offer
upon
that
altar.
003:005
In
Gibeon
the
LORD
appeared
to
Solomon
in
a
dream
by
night:
and
God
said,
Ask
what
I
shall
give
thee.
003:006
And
Solomon
said,
Thou
hast
shewed
unto
thy
servant
David
my
father
great
mercy,
according
as
he
walked
before
thee
in
truth,
and
in
righteousness,
and
in
uprightness
of
heart
with
thee;
and
thou
hast
kept
for
him
this
great
kindness,
that
thou
hast
given
him
a
son
to
sit
on
his
throne,
as
it
is
this
day.
003:007
And
now,
O
LORD
my
God,
thou
hast
made
thy
servant
king
instead
of
David
my
father:
and
I
am
but
a
little
child:
I
know
not
how
to
go
out
or
come
in.
003:008
And
thy
servant
is
in
the
midst
of
thy
people
which
thou
hast
chosen,
a
great
people,
that
cannot
be
numbered
nor
counted
for
multitude.
003:009
Give
therefore
thy
servant
an
understanding
heart
to
judge
thy
people,
that
I
may
discern
between
good
and
bad:
for
who
is
able
to
judge
this
thy
so
great
a
people?
003:010
And
the
speech
pleased
the
LORD,
that
Solomon
had
asked
this
thing.
003:011
And
God
said
unto
him,
Because
thou
hast
asked
this
thing,
and
hast
not
asked
for
thyself
long
life;
neither
hast
asked
riches
for
thyself,
nor
hast
asked
the
life
of
thine
enemies;
but
hast
asked
for
thyself
understanding
to
discern
judgment;
003:012
Behold,
I
have
done
according
to
thy
words:
lo,
I
have
given
thee
a
wise
and
an
understanding
heart;
so
that
there
was
none
like
thee
before
thee,
neither
after
thee
shall
any
arise
like
unto
thee.
003:013
And
I
have
also
given
thee
that
which
thou
hast
not
asked,
both
riches,
and
honour:
so
that
there
shall
not
be
any
among
the
kings
like
unto
thee
all
thy
days.
003:014
And
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
ways,
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
commandments,
as
thy
father
David
did
walk,
then
I
will
lengthen
thy
days.
003:015
And
Solomon
awoke;
and,
behold,
it
was
a
dream.
And
he
came
to
Jerusalem,
and
stood
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
and
offered
up
burnt
offerings,
and
offered
peace
offerings,
and
made
a
feast
to
all
his
servants.
003:016
Then
came
there
two
women,
that
were
harlots,
unto
the
king,
and
stood
before
him.
003:017
And
the
one
woman
said,
O
my
lord,
I
and
this
woman
dwell
in
one
house;
and
I
was
delivered
of
a
child
with
her
in
the
house.
003:018
And
it
came
to
pass
the
third
day
after
that
I
was
delivered,
that
this
woman
was
delivered
also:
and
we
were
together;
there
was
no
stranger
with
us
in
the
house,
save
we
two
in
the
house.
003:019
And
this
woman's
child
died
in
the
night;
because
she
overlaid
it.
003:020
And
she
arose
at
midnight,
and
took
my
son
from
beside
me,
while
thine
handmaid
slept,
and
laid
it
in
her
bosom,
and
laid
her
dead
child
in
my
bosom.
003:021
And
when
I
rose
in
the
morning
to
give
my
child
suck,
behold,
it
was
dead:
but
when
I
had
considered
it
in
the
morning,
behold,
it
was
not
my
son,
which
I
did
bear.
003:022
And
the
other
woman
said,
Nay;
but
the
living
is
my
son,
and
the
dead
is
thy
son.
And
this
said,
No;
but
the
dead
is
thy
son,
and
the
living
is
my
son.
Thus
they
spake
before
the
king.
003:023
Then
said
the
king,
The
one
saith,
This
is
my
son
that
liveth,
and
thy
son
is
the
dead:
and
the
other
saith,
Nay;
but
thy
son
is
the
dead,
and
my
son
is
the
living.
003:024
And
the
king
said,
Bring
me
a
sword.
And
they
brought
a
sword
before
the
king.
003:025
And
the
king
said,
Divide
the
living
child
in
two,
and
give
half
to
the
one,
and
half
to
the
other.
003:026
Then
spake
the
woman
whose
the
living
child
was
unto
the
king,
for
her
bowels
yearned
upon
her
son,
and
she
said,
O
my
lord,
give
her
the
living
child,
and
in
no
wise
slay
it.
But
the
other
said,
Let
it
be
neither
mine
nor
thine,
but
divide
it.
003:027
Then
the
king
answered
and
said,
Give
her
the
living
child,
and
in
no
wise
slay
it:
she
is
the
mother
thereof.
003:028
And
all
Israel
heard
of
the
judgment
which
the
king
had
judged;
and
they
feared
the
king:
for
they
saw
that
the
wisdom
of
God
was
in
him,
to
do
judgment.
004:001
So
king
Solomon
was
king
over
all
Israel.
004:002
And
these
were
the
princes
which
he
had;
Azariah
the
son
of
Zadok
the
priest,
004:003
Elihoreph
and
Ahiah,
the
sons
of
Shisha,
scribes;
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Ahilud,
the
recorder.
004:004
And
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
over
the
host:
and
Zadok
and
Abiathar
were
the
priests:
004:005
And
Azariah
the
son
of
Nathan
was
over
the
officers:
and
Zabud
the
son
of
Nathan
was
principal
officer,
and
the
king's
friend:
004:006
And
Ahishar
was
over
the
household:
and
Adoniram
the
son
of
Abda
was
over
the
tribute.
004:007
And
Solomon
had
twelve
officers
over
all
Israel,
which
provided
victuals
for
the
king
and
his
household:
each
man
his
month
in
a
year
made
provision.
004:008
And
these
are
their
names:
The
son
of
Hur,
in
mount
Ephraim:
004:009
The
son
of
Dekar,
in
Makaz,
and
in
Shaalbim,
and
Bethshemesh,
and
Elonbethhanan:
004:010
The
son
of
Hesed,
in
Aruboth;
to
him
pertained
Sochoh,
and
all
the
land
of
Hepher:
004:011
The
son
of
Abinadab,
in
all
the
region
of
Dor;
which
had
Taphath
the
daughter
of
Solomon
to
wife:
004:012
Baana
the
son
of
Ahilud;
to
him
pertained
Taanach
and
Megiddo,
and
all
Bethshean,
which
is
by
Zartanah
beneath
Jezreel,
from
Bethshean
to
Abelmeholah,
even
unto
the
place
that
is
beyond
Jokneam:
004:013
The
son
of
Geber,
in
Ramothgilead;
to
him
pertained
the
towns
of
Jair
the
son
of
Manasseh,
which
are
in
Gilead;
to
him
also
pertained
the
region
of
Argob,
which
is
in
Bashan,
threescore
great
cities
with
walls
and
brasen
bars:
004:014
Ahinadab
the
son
of
Iddo
had
Mahanaim:
004:015
Ahimaaz
was
in
Naphtali;
he
also
took
Basmath
the
daughter
of
Solomon
to
wife:
004:016
Baanah
the
son
of
Hushai
was
in
Asher
and
in
Aloth:
004:017
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Paruah,
in
Issachar:
004:018
Shimei
the
son
of
Elah,
in
Benjamin:
004:019
Geber
the
son
of
Uri
was
in
the
country
of
Gilead,
in
the
country
of
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
and
of
Og
king
of
Bashan;
and
he
was
the
only
officer
which
was
in
the
land.
004:020
Judah
and
Israel
were
many,
as
the
sand
which
is
by
the
sea
in
multitude,
eating
and
drinking,
and
making
merry.
004:021
And
Solomon
reigned
over
all
kingdoms
from
the
river
unto
the
land
of
the
Philistines,
and
unto
the
border
of
Egypt:
they
brought
presents,
and
served
Solomon
all
the
days
of
his
life.
004:022
And
Solomon's
provision
for
one
day
was
thirty
measures
of
fine
flour,
and
threescore
measures
of
meal,
004:023
Ten
fat
oxen,
and
twenty
oxen
out
of
the
pastures,
and
an
hundred
sheep,
beside
harts,
and
roebucks,
and
fallowdeer,
and
fatted
fowl.
004:024
For
he
had
dominion
over
all
the
region
on
this
side
the
river,
from
Tiphsah
even
to
Azzah,
over
all
the
kings
on
this
side
the
river:
and
he
had
peace
on
all
sides
round
about
him.
004:025
And
Judah
and
Israel
dwelt
safely,
every
man
under
his
vine
and
under
his
fig
tree,
from
Dan
even
to
Beersheba,
all
the
days
of
Solomon.
004:026
And
Solomon
had
forty
thousand
stalls
of
horses
for
his
chariots,
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen.
004:027
And
those
officers
provided
victual
for
king
Solomon,
and
for
all
that
came
unto
king
Solomon's
table,
every
man
in
his
month:
they
lacked
nothing.
004:028
Barley
also
and
straw
for
the
horses
and
dromedaries
brought
they
unto
the
place
where
the
officers
were,
every
man
according
to
his
charge.
004:029
And
God
gave
Solomon
wisdom
and
understanding
exceeding
much,
and
largeness
of
heart,
even
as
the
sand
that
is
on
the
sea
shore.
004:030
And
Solomon's
wisdom
excelled
the
wisdom
of
all
the
children
of
the
east
country,
and
all
the
wisdom
of
Egypt.
004:031
For
he
was
wiser
than
all
men;
than
Ethan
the
Ezrahite,
and
Heman,
and
Chalcol,
and
Darda,
the
sons
of
Mahol:
and
his
fame
was
in
all
nations
round
about.
004:032
And
he
spake
three
thousand
proverbs:
and
his
songs
were
a
thousand
and
five.
004:033
And
he
spake
of
trees,
from
the
cedar
tree
that
is
in
Lebanon
even
unto
the
hyssop
that
springeth
out
of
the
wall:
he
spake
also
of
beasts,
and
of
fowl,
and
of
creeping
things,
and
of
fishes.
004:034
And
there
came
of
all
people
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
Solomon,
from
all
kings
of
the
earth,
which
had
heard
of
his
wisdom.
005:001
And
Hiram
king
of
Tyre
sent
his
servants
unto
Solomon;
for
he
had
heard
that
they
had
anointed
him
king
in
the
room
of
his
father:
for
Hiram
was
ever
a
lover
of
David.
005:002
And
Solomon
sent
to
Hiram,
saying,
005:003
Thou
knowest
how
that
David
my
father
could
not
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
LORD
his
God
for
the
wars
which
were
about
him
on
every
side,
until
the
LORD
put
them
under
the
soles
of
his
feet.
005:004
But
now
the
LORD
my
God
hath
given
me
rest
on
every
side,
so
that
there
is
neither
adversary
nor
evil
occurrent.
005:005
And,
behold,
I
purpose
to
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
LORD
my
God,
as
the
LORD
spake
unto
David
my
father,
saying,
Thy
son,
whom
I
will
set
upon
thy
throne
in
thy
room,
he
shall
build
an
house
unto
my
name.
005:006
Now
therefore
command
thou
that
they
hew
me
cedar
trees
out
of
Lebanon;
and
my
servants
shall
be
with
thy
servants:
and
unto
thee
will
I
give
hire
for
thy
servants
according
to
all
that
thou
shalt
appoint:
for
thou
knowest
that
there
is
not
among
us
any
that
can
skill
to
hew
timber
like
unto
the
Sidonians.
005:007
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Hiram
heard
the
words
of
Solomon,
that
he
rejoiced
greatly,
and
said,
Blessed
be
the
LORD
this
day,
which
hath
given
unto
David
a
wise
son
over
this
great
people.
005:008
And
Hiram
sent
to
Solomon,
saying,
I
have
considered
the
things
which
thou
sentest
to
me
for:
and
I
will
do
all
thy
desire
concerning
timber
of
cedar,
and
concerning
timber
of
fir.
005:009
My
servants
shall
bring
them
down
from
Lebanon
unto
the
sea:
and
I
will
convey
them
by
sea
in
floats
unto
the
place
that
thou
shalt
appoint
me,
and
will
cause
them
to
be
discharged
there,
and
thou
shalt
receive
them:
and
thou
shalt
accomplish
my
desire,
in
giving
food
for
my
household.
005:010
So
Hiram
gave
Solomon
cedar
trees
and
fir
trees
according
to
all
his
desire.
005:011
And
Solomon
gave
Hiram
twenty
thousand
measures
of
wheat
for
food
to
his
household,
and
twenty
measures
of
pure
oil:
thus
gave
Solomon
to
Hiram
year
by
year.
005:012
And
the
LORD
gave
Solomon
wisdom,
as
he
promised
him:
and
there
was
peace
between
Hiram
and
Solomon;
and
they
two
made
a
league
together.
005:013
And
king
Solomon
raised
a
levy
out
of
all
Israel;
and
the
levy
was
thirty
thousand
men.
005:014
And
he
sent
them
to
Lebanon,
ten
thousand
a
month
by
courses:
a
month
they
were
in
Lebanon,
and
two
months
at
home:
and
Adoniram
was
over
the
levy.
005:015
And
Solomon
had
threescore
and
ten
thousand
that
bare
burdens,
and
fourscore
thousand
hewers
in
the
mountains;
005:016
Beside
the
chief
of
Solomon's
officers
which
were
over
the
work,
three
thousand
and
three
hundred,
which
ruled
over
the
people
that
wrought
in
the
work.
005:017
And
the
king
commanded,
and
they
brought
great
stones,
costly
stones,
and
hewed
stones,
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
house.
005:018
And
Solomon's
builders
and
Hiram's
builders
did
hew
them,
and
the
stonesquarers:
so
they
prepared
timber
and
stones
to
build
the
house.
006:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
four
hundred
and
eightieth
year
after
the
children
of
Israel
were
come
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
in
the
fourth
year
of
Solomon's
reign
over
Israel,
in
the
month
Zif,
which
is
the
second
month,
that
he
began
to
build
the
house
of
the
LORD.
006:002
And
the
house
which
king
Solomon
built
for
the
LORD,
the
length
thereof
was
threescore
cubits,
and
the
breadth
thereof
twenty
cubits,
and
the
height
thereof
thirty
cubits.
006:003
And
the
porch
before
the
temple
of
the
house,
twenty
cubits
was
the
length
thereof,
according
to
the
breadth
of
the
house;
and
ten
cubits
was
the
breadth
thereof
before
the
house.
006:004
And
for
the
house
he
made
windows
of
narrow
lights.
006:005
And
against
the
wall
of
the
house
he
built
chambers
round
about,
against
the
walls
of
the
house
round
about,
both
of
the
temple
and
of
the
oracle:
and
he
made
chambers
round
about:
006:006
The
nethermost
chamber
was
five
cubits
broad,
and
the
middle
was
six
cubits
broad,
and
the
third
was
seven
cubits
broad:
for
without
in
the
wall
of
the
house
he
made
narrowed
rests
round
about,
that
the
beams
should
not
be
fastened
in
the
walls
of
the
house.
006:007
And
the
house,
when
it
was
in
building,
was
built
of
stone
made
ready
before
it
was
brought
thither:
so
that
there
was
neither
hammer
nor
axe
nor
any
tool
of
iron
heard
in
the
house,
while
it
was
in
building.
006:008
The
door
for
the
middle
chamber
was
in
the
right
side
of
the
house:
and
they
went
up
with
winding
stairs
into
the
middle
chamber,
and
out
of
the
middle
into
the
third.
006:009
So
he
built
the
house,
and
finished
it;
and
covered
the
house
with
beams
and
boards
of
cedar.
006:010
And
then
he
built
chambers
against
all
the
house,
five
cubits
high:
and
they
rested
on
the
house
with
timber
of
cedar.
006:011
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Solomon,
saying,
006:012
Concerning
this
house
which
thou
art
in
building,
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
statutes,
and
execute
my
judgments,
and
keep
all
my
commandments
to
walk
in
them;
then
will
I
perform
my
word
with
thee,
which
I
spake
unto
David
thy
father:
006:013
And
I
will
dwell
among
the
children
of
Israel,
and
will
not
forsake
my
people
Israel.
006:014
So
Solomon
built
the
house,
and
finished
it.
006:015
And
he
built
the
walls
of
the
house
within
with
boards
of
cedar,
both
the
floor
of
the
house,
and
the
walls
of
the
ceiling:
and
he
covered
them
on
the
inside
with
wood,
and
covered
the
floor
of
the
house
with
planks
of
fir.
006:016
And
he
built
twenty
cubits
on
the
sides
of
the
house,
both
the
floor
and
the
walls
with
boards
of
cedar:
he
even
built
them
for
it
within,
even
for
the
oracle,
even
for
the
most
holy
place.
006:017
And
the
house,
that
is,
the
temple
before
it,
was
forty
cubits
long.
006:018
And
the
cedar
of
the
house
within
was
carved
with
knops
and
open
flowers:
all
was
cedar;
there
was
no
stone
seen.
006:019
And
the
oracle
he
prepared
in
the
house
within,
to
set
there
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD.
006:020
And
the
oracle
in
the
forepart
was
twenty
cubits
in
length,
and
twenty
cubits
in
breadth,
and
twenty
cubits
in
the
height
thereof:
and
he
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold;
and
so
covered
the
altar
which
was
of
cedar.
006:021
So
Solomon
overlaid
the
house
within
with
pure
gold:
and
he
made
a
partition
by
the
chains
of
gold
before
the
oracle;
and
he
overlaid
it
with
gold.
006:022
And
the
whole
house
he
overlaid
with
gold,
until
he
had
finished
all
the
house:
also
the
whole
altar
that
was
by
the
oracle
he
overlaid
with
gold.
006:023
And
within
the
oracle
he
made
two
cherubims
of
olive
tree,
each
ten
cubits
high.
006:024
And
five
cubits
was
the
one
wing
of
the
cherub,
and
five
cubits
the
other
wing
of
the
cherub:
from
the
uttermost
part
of
the
one
wing
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
other
were
ten
cubits.
006:025
And
the
other
cherub
was
ten
cubits:
both
the
cherubims
were
of
one
measure
and
one
size.
006:026
The
height
of
the
one
cherub
was
ten
cubits,
and
so
was
it
of
the
other
cherub.
006:027
And
he
set
the
cherubims
within
the
inner
house:
and
they
stretched
forth
the
wings
of
the
cherubims,
so
that
the
wing
of
the
one
touched
the
one
wall,
and
the
wing
of
the
other
cherub
touched
the
other
wall;
and
their
wings
touched
one
another
in
the
midst
of
the
house.
006:028
And
he
overlaid
the
cherubims
with
gold.
006:029
And
he
carved
all
the
walls
of
the
house
round
about
with
carved
figures
of
cherubims
and
palm
trees
and
open
flowers,
within
and
without.
006:030
And
the
floors
of
the
house
he
overlaid
with
gold,
within
and
without.
006:031
And
for
the
entering
of
the
oracle
he
made
doors
of
olive
tree:
the
lintel
and
side
posts
were
a
fifth
part
of
the
wall.
006:032
The
two
doors
also
were
of
olive
tree;
and
he
carved
upon
them
carvings
of
cherubims
and
palm
trees
and
open
flowers,
and
overlaid
them
with
gold,
and
spread
gold
upon
the
cherubims,
and
upon
the
palm
trees.
006:033
So
also
made
he
for
the
door
of
the
temple
posts
of
olive
tree,
a
fourth
part
of
the
wall.
006:034
And
the
two
doors
were
of
fir
tree:
the
two
leaves
of
the
one
door
were
folding,
and
the
two
leaves
of
the
other
door
were
folding.
006:035
And
he
carved
thereon
cherubims
and
palm
trees
and
open
flowers:
and
covered
them
with
gold
fitted
upon
the
carved
work.
006:036
And
he
built
the
inner
court
with
three
rows
of
hewed
stone,
and
a
row
of
cedar
beams.
006:037
In
the
fourth
year
was
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
laid,
in
the
month
Zif:
006:038
And
in
the
eleventh
year,
in
the
month
Bul,
which
is
the
eighth
month,
was
the
house
finished
throughout
all
the
parts
thereof,
and
according
to
all
the
fashion
of
it.
So
was
he
seven
years
in
building
it.
007:001
But
Solomon
was
building
his
own
