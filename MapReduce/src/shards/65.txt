by
the
way
that
he
came
to
Bethel.
013:011
Now
there
dwelt
an
old
prophet
in
Bethel;
and
his
sons
came
and
told
him
all
the
works
that
the
man
of
God
had
done
that
day
in
Bethel:
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
unto
the
king,
them
they
told
also
to
their
father.
013:012
And
their
father
said
unto
them,
What
way
went
he?
For
his
sons
had
seen
what
way
the
man
of
God
went,
which
came
from
Judah.
013:013
And
he
said
unto
his
sons,
Saddle
me
the
ass.
So
they
saddled
him
the
ass:
and
he
rode
thereon,
013:014
And
went
after
the
man
of
God,
and
found
him
sitting
under
an
oak:
and
he
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
the
man
of
God
that
camest
from
Judah?
And
he
said,
I
am.
013:015
Then
he
said
unto
him,
Come
home
with
me,
and
eat
bread.
013:016
And
he
said,
I
may
not
return
with
thee,
nor
go
in
with
thee:
neither
will
I
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
with
thee
in
this
place:
013:017
For
it
was
said
to
me
by
the
word
of
the
LORD,
Thou
shalt
eat
no
bread
nor
drink
water
there,
nor
turn
again
to
go
by
the
way
that
thou
camest.
013:018
He
said
unto
him,
I
am
a
prophet
also
as
thou
art;
and
an
angel
spake
unto
me
by
the
word
of
the
LORD,
saying,
Bring
him
back
with
thee
into
thine
house,
that
he
may
eat
bread
and
drink
water.
But
he
lied
unto
him.
013:019
So
he
went
back
with
him,
and
did
eat
bread
in
his
house,
and
drank
water.
013:020
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
sat
at
the
table,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
the
prophet
that
brought
him
back:
013:021
And
he
cried
unto
the
man
of
God
that
came
from
Judah,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Forasmuch
as
thou
hast
disobeyed
the
mouth
of
the
LORD,
and
hast
not
kept
the
commandment
which
the
LORD
thy
God
commanded
thee,
013:022
But
camest
back,
and
hast
eaten
bread
and
drunk
water
in
the
place,
of
the
which
the
Lord
did
say
to
thee,
Eat
no
bread,
and
drink
no
water;
thy
carcase
shall
not
come
unto
the
sepulchre
of
thy
fathers.
013:023
And
it
came
to
pass,
after
he
had
eaten
bread,
and
after
he
had
drunk,
that
he
saddled
for
him
the
ass,
to
wit,
for
the
prophet
whom
he
had
brought
back.
013:024
And
when
he
was
gone,
a
lion
met
him
by
the
way,
and
slew
him:
and
his
carcase
was
cast
in
the
way,
and
the
ass
stood
by
it,
the
lion
also
stood
by
the
carcase.
013:025
And,
behold,
men
passed
by,
and
saw
the
carcase
cast
in
the
way,
and
the
lion
standing
by
the
carcase:
and
they
came
and
told
it
in
the
city
where
the
old
prophet
dwelt.
013:026
And
when
the
prophet
that
brought
him
back
from
the
way
heard
thereof,
he
said,
It
is
the
man
of
God,
who
was
disobedient
unto
the
word
of
the
LORD:
therefore
the
LORD
hath
delivered
him
unto
the
lion,
which
hath
torn
him,
and
slain
him,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
unto
him.
013:027
And
he
spake
to
his
sons,
saying,
Saddle
me
the
ass.
And
they
saddled
him.
013:028
And
he
went
and
found
his
carcase
cast
in
the
way,
and
the
ass
and
the
lion
standing
by
the
carcase:
the
lion
had
not
eaten
the
carcase,
nor
torn
the
ass.
013:029
And
the
prophet
took
up
the
carcase
of
the
man
of
God,
and
laid
it
upon
the
ass,
and
brought
it
back:
and
the
old
prophet
came
to
the
city,
to
mourn
and
to
bury
him.
013:030
And
he
laid
his
carcase
in
his
own
grave;
and
they
mourned
over
him,
saying,
Alas,
my
brother!
013:031
And
it
came
to
pass,
after
he
had
buried
him,
that
he
spake
to
his
sons,
saying,
When
I
am
dead,
then
bury
me
in
the
sepulchre
wherein
the
man
of
God
is
buried;
lay
my
bones
beside
his
bones:
013:032
For
the
saying
which
he
cried
by
the
word
of
the
LORD
against
the
altar
in
Bethel,
and
against
all
the
houses
of
the
high
places
which
are
in
the
cities
of
Samaria,
shall
surely
come
to
pass.
013:033
After
this
thing
Jeroboam
returned
not
from
his
evil
way,
but
made
again
of
the
lowest
of
the
people
priests
of
the
high
places:
whosoever
would,
he
consecrated
him,
and
he
became
one
of
the
priests
of
the
high
places.
013:034
And
this
thing
became
sin
unto
the
house
of
Jeroboam,
even
to
cut
it
off,
and
to
destroy
it
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth.
014:001
At
that
time
Abijah
the
son
of
Jeroboam
fell
sick.
014:002
And
Jeroboam
said
to
his
wife,
Arise,
I
pray
thee,
and
disguise
thyself,
that
thou
be
not
known
to
be
the
wife
of
Jeroboam;
and
get
thee
to
Shiloh:
behold,
there
is
Ahijah
the
prophet,
which
told
me
that
I
should
be
king
over
this
people.
014:003
And
take
with
thee
ten
loaves,
and
cracknels,
and
a
cruse
of
honey,
and
go
to
him:
he
shall
tell
thee
what
shall
become
of
the
child.
014:004
And
Jeroboam's
wife
did
so,
and
arose,
and
went
to
Shiloh,
and
came
to
the
house
of
Ahijah.
But
Ahijah
could
not
see;
for
his
eyes
were
set
by
reason
of
his
age.
014:005
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Ahijah,
Behold,
the
wife
of
Jeroboam
cometh
to
ask
a
thing
of
thee
for
her
son;
for
he
is
sick:
thus
and
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
her:
for
it
shall
be,
when
she
cometh
in,
that
she
shall
feign
herself
to
be
another
woman.
014:006
And
it
was
so,
when
Ahijah
heard
the
sound
of
her
feet,
as
she
came
in
at
the
door,
that
he
said,
Come
in,
thou
wife
of
Jeroboam;
why
feignest
thou
thyself
to
be
another?
for
I
am
sent
to
thee
with
heavy
tidings.
014:007
Go,
tell
Jeroboam,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Forasmuch
as
I
exalted
thee
from
among
the
people,
and
made
thee
prince
over
my
people
Israel,
014:008
And
rent
the
kingdom
away
from
the
house
of
David,
and
gave
it
thee:
and
yet
thou
hast
not
been
as
my
servant
David,
who
kept
my
commandments,
and
who
followed
me
with
all
his
heart,
to
do
that
only
which
was
right
in
mine
eyes;
014:009
But
hast
done
evil
above
all
that
were
before
thee:
for
thou
hast
gone
and
made
thee
other
gods,
and
molten
images,
to
provoke
me
to
anger,
and
hast
cast
me
behind
thy
back:
014:010
Therefore,
behold,
I
will
bring
evil
upon
the
house
of
Jeroboam,
and
will
cut
off
from
Jeroboam
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall,
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
Israel,
and
will
take
away
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Jeroboam,
as
a
man
taketh
away
dung,
till
it
be
all
gone.
014:011
Him
that
dieth
of
Jeroboam
in
the
city
shall
the
dogs
eat;
and
him
that
dieth
in
the
field
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat:
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken
it.
014:012
Arise
thou
therefore,
get
thee
to
thine
own
house:
and
when
thy
feet
enter
into
the
city,
the
child
shall
die.
014:013
And
all
Israel
shall
mourn
for
him,
and
bury
him:
for
he
only
of
Jeroboam
shall
come
to
the
grave,
because
in
him
there
is
found
some
good
thing
toward
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
in
the
house
of
Jeroboam.
014:014
Moreover
the
LORD
shall
raise
him
up
a
king
over
Israel,
who
shall
cut
off
the
house
of
Jeroboam
that
day:
but
what?
even
now.
014:015
For
the
LORD
shall
smite
Israel,
as
a
reed
is
shaken
in
the
water,
and
he
shall
root
up
Israel
out
of
this
good
land,
which
he
gave
to
their
fathers,
and
shall
scatter
them
beyond
the
river,
because
they
have
made
their
groves,
provoking
the
LORD
to
anger.
014:016
And
he
shall
give
Israel
up
because
of
the
sins
of
Jeroboam,
who
did
sin,
and
who
made
Israel
to
sin.
014:017
And
Jeroboam's
wife
arose,
and
departed,
and
came
to
Tirzah:
and
when
she
came
to
the
threshold
of
the
door,
the
child
died;
014:018
And
they
buried
him;
and
all
Israel
mourned
for
him,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
his
servant
Ahijah
the
prophet.
014:019
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jeroboam,
how
he
warred,
and
how
he
reigned,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel.
014:020
And
the
days
which
Jeroboam
reigned
were
two
and
twenty
years:
and
he
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
Nadab
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
014:021
And
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
reigned
in
Judah.
Rehoboam
was
forty
and
one
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
seventeen
years
in
Jerusalem,
the
city
which
the
LORD
did
choose
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
to
put
his
name
there.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Naamah
an
Ammonitess.
014:022
And
Judah
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
they
provoked
him
to
jealousy
with
their
sins
which
they
had
committed,
above
all
that
their
fathers
had
done.
014:023
For
they
also
built
them
high
places,
and
images,
and
groves,
on
every
high
hill,
and
under
every
green
tree.
014:024
And
there
were
also
sodomites
in
the
land:
and
they
did
according
to
all
the
abominations
of
the
nations
which
the
LORD
cast
out
before
the
children
of
Israel.
014:025
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifth
year
of
king
Rehoboam,
that
Shishak
king
of
Egypt
came
up
against
Jerusalem:
014:026
And
he
took
away
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house;
he
even
took
away
all:
and
he
took
away
all
the
shields
of
gold
which
Solomon
had
made.
014:027
And
king
Rehoboam
made
in
their
stead
brasen
shields,
and
committed
them
unto
the
hands
of
the
chief
of
the
guard,
which
kept
the
door
of
the
king's
house.
014:028
And
it
was
so,
when
the
king
went
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
that
the
guard
bare
them,
and
brought
them
back
into
the
guard
chamber.
014:029
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Rehoboam,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
014:030
And
there
was
war
between
Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
all
their
days.
014:031
And
Rehoboam
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Naamah
an
Ammonitess.
And
Abijam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:001
Now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
reigned
Abijam
over
Judah.
015:002
Three
years
reigned
he
in
Jerusalem.
and
his
mother's
name
was
Maachah,
the
daughter
of
Abishalom.
015:003
And
he
walked
in
all
the
sins
of
his
father,
which
he
had
done
before
him:
and
his
heart
was
not
perfect
with
the
LORD
his
God,
as
the
heart
of
David
his
father.
015:004
Nevertheless
for
David's
sake
did
the
LORD
his
God
give
him
a
lamp
in
Jerusalem,
to
set
up
his
son
after
him,
and
to
establish
Jerusalem:
015:005
Because
David
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
and
turned
not
aside
from
any
thing
that
he
commanded
him
all
the
days
of
his
life,
save
only
in
the
matter
of
Uriah
the
Hittite.
015:006
And
there
was
war
between
Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
all
the
days
of
his
life.
015:007
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Abijam,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
And
there
was
war
between
Abijam
and
Jeroboam.
015:008
And
Abijam
slept
with
his
fathers;
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
David:
and
Asa
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:009
And
in
the
twentieth
year
of
Jeroboam
king
of
Israel
reigned
Asa
over
Judah.
015:010
And
forty
and
one
years
reigned
he
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Maachah,
the
daughter
of
Abishalom.
015:011
And
Asa
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
as
did
David
his
father.
015:012
And
he
took
away
the
sodomites
out
of
the
land,
and
removed
all
the
idols
that
his
fathers
had
made.
015:013
And
also
Maachah
his
mother,
even
her
he
removed
from
being
queen,
because
she
had
made
an
idol
in
a
grove;
and
Asa
destroyed
her
idol,
and
burnt
it
by
the
brook
Kidron.
015:014
But
the
high
places
were
not
removed:
nevertheless
Asa's
heart
was
perfect
with
the
LORD
all
his
days.
015:015
And
he
brought
in
the
things
which
his
father
had
dedicated,
and
the
things
which
himself
had
dedicated,
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
silver,
and
gold,
and
vessels.
015:016
And
there
was
war
between
Asa
and
Baasha
king
of
Israel
all
their
days.
015:017
And
Baasha
king
of
Israel
went
up
against
Judah,
and
built
Ramah,
that
he
might
not
suffer
any
to
go
out
or
come
in
to
Asa
king
of
Judah.
015:018
Then
Asa
took
all
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
were
left
in
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house,
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
his
servants:
and
king
Asa
sent
them
to
Benhadad,
the
son
of
Tabrimon,
the
son
of
Hezion,
king
of
Syria,
that
dwelt
at
Damascus,
saying,
015:019
There
is
a
league
between
me
and
thee,
and
between
my
father
and
thy
father:
behold,
I
have
sent
unto
thee
a
present
of
silver
and
gold;
come
and
break
thy
league
with
Baasha
king
of
Israel,
that
he
may
depart
from
me.
015:020
So
Benhadad
hearkened
unto
king
Asa,
and
sent
the
captains
of
the
hosts
which
he
had
against
the
cities
of
Israel,
and
smote
Ijon,
and
Dan,
and
Abelbethmaachah,
and
all
Cinneroth,
with
all
the
land
of
Naphtali.
015:021
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Baasha
heard
thereof,
that
he
left
off
building
of
Ramah,
and
dwelt
in
Tirzah.
015:022
Then
king
Asa
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
Judah;
none
was
exempted:
and
they
took
away
the
stones
of
Ramah,
and
the
timber
thereof,
wherewith
Baasha
had
builded;
and
king
Asa
built
with
them
Geba
of
Benjamin,
and
Mizpah.
015:023
The
rest
of
all
the
acts
of
Asa,
and
all
his
might,
and
all
that
he
did,
and
the
cities
which
he
built,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
Nevertheless
in
the
time
of
his
old
age
he
was
diseased
in
his
feet.
015:024
And
Asa
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David
his
father:
and
Jehoshaphat
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:025
And
Nadab
the
son
of
Jeroboam
began
to
reign
over
Israel
in
the
second
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah,
and
reigned
over
Israel
two
years.
015:026
And
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
walked
in
the
way
of
his
father,
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
Israel
to
sin.
015:027
And
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah,
of
the
house
of
Issachar,
conspired
against
him;
and
Baasha
smote
him
at
Gibbethon,
which
belonged
to
the
Philistines;
for
Nadab
and
all
Israel
laid
siege
to
Gibbethon.
015:028
Even
in
the
third
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah
did
Baasha
slay
him,
and
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:029
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
reigned,
that
he
smote
all
the
house
of
Jeroboam;
he
left
not
to
Jeroboam
any
that
breathed,
until
he
had
destroyed
him,
according
unto
the
saying
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
Ahijah
the
Shilonite:
015:030
Because
of
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
which
he
sinned,
and
which
he
made
Israel
sin,
by
his
provocation
wherewith
he
provoked
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
to
anger.
015:031
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Nadab,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
015:032
And
there
was
war
between
Asa
and
Baasha
king
of
Israel
all
their
days.
015:033
In
the
third
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah
began
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah
to
reign
over
all
Israel
in
Tirzah,
twenty
and
four
years.
015:034
And
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
walked
in
the
way
of
Jeroboam,
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
Israel
to
sin.
016:001
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
against
Baasha,
saying,
016:002
Forasmuch
as
I
exalted
thee
out
of
the
dust,
and
made
thee
prince
over
my
people
Israel;
and
thou
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
Jeroboam,
and
hast
made
my
people
Israel
to
sin,
to
provoke
me
to
anger
with
their
sins;
016:003
Behold,
I
will
take
away
the
posterity
of
Baasha,
and
the
posterity
of
his
house;
and
will
make
thy
house
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat.
016:004
Him
that
dieth
of
Baasha
in
the
city
shall
the
dogs
eat;
and
him
that
dieth
of
his
in
the
fields
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat.
016:005
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Baasha,
and
what
he
did,
and
his
might,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
016:006
So
Baasha
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
in
Tirzah:
and
Elah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
016:007
And
also
by
the
hand
of
the
prophet
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
against
Baasha,
and
against
his
house,
even
for
all
the
evil
that
he
did
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
in
provoking
him
to
anger
with
the
work
of
his
hands,
in
being
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam;
and
because
he
killed
him.
016:008
In
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah
began
Elah
the
son
of
Baasha
to
reign
over
Israel
in
Tirzah,
two
years.
016:009
And
his
servant
Zimri,
captain
of
half
his
chariots,
conspired
against
him,
as
he
was
in
Tirzah,
drinking
himself
drunk
in
the
house
of
Arza
steward
of
his
house
in
Tirzah.
016:010
And
Zimri
went
in
and
smote
him,
and
killed
him,
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah,
and
reigned
in
his
stead.
016:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
began
to
reign,
as
soon
as
he
sat
on
his
throne,
that
he
slew
all
the
house
of
Baasha:
he
left
him
not
one
that
pisseth
against
a
wall,
neither
of
his
kinsfolks,
nor
of
his
friends.
016:012
Thus
did
Zimri
destroy
all
the
house
of
Baasha,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
against
Baasha
by
Jehu
the
prophet.
016:013
For
all
the
sins
of
Baasha,
and
the
sins
of
Elah
his
son,
by
which
they
sinned,
and
by
which
they
made
Israel
to
sin,
in
provoking
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
to
anger
with
their
vanities.
016:014
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Elah,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
016:015
In
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah
did
Zimri
reign
seven
days
in
Tirzah.
And
the
people
were
encamped
against
Gibbethon,
which
belonged
to
the
Philistines.
016:016
And
the
people
that
were
encamped
heard
say,
Zimri
hath
conspired,
and
hath
also
slain
the
king:
wherefore
all
Israel
made
Omri,
the
captain
of
the
host,
king
over
Israel
that
day
in
the
camp.
016:017
And
Omri
went
up
from
Gibbethon,
and
all
Israel
with
him,
and
they
besieged
Tirzah.
016:018
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Zimri
saw
that
the
city
was
taken,
that
he
went
into
the
palace
of
the
king's
house,
and
burnt
the
king's
house
over
him
with
fire,
and
died.
016:019
For
his
sins
which
he
sinned
in
doing
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
in
walking
in
the
way
of
Jeroboam,
and
in
his
sin
which
he
did,
to
make
Israel
to
sin.
016:020
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Zimri,
and
his
treason
that
he
wrought,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
016:021
Then
were
the
people
of
Israel
divided
into
two
parts:
half
of
the
people
followed
Tibni
the
son
of
Ginath,
to
make
him
king;
and
half
followed
Omri.
016:022
But
the
people
that
followed
Omri
prevailed
against
the
people
that
followed
Tibni
the
son
of
Ginath:
so
Tibni
died,
and
Omri
reigned.
016:023
In
the
thirty
and
first
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah
began
Omri
to
reign
over
Israel,
twelve
years:
six
years
reigned
he
in
Tirzah.
016:024
And
he
bought
the
hill
Samaria
of
Shemer
for
two
talents
of
silver,
and
built
on
the
hill,
and
called
the
name
of
the
city
which
he
built,
after
the
name
of
Shemer,
owner
of
the
hill,
Samaria.
016:025
But
Omri
wrought
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD,
and
did
worse
than
all
that
were
before
him.
016:026
For
he
walked
in
all
the
way
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
Israel
to
sin,
to
provoke
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
to
anger
with
their
vanities.
016:027
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Omri
which
he
did,
and
his
might
that
he
shewed,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
016:028
So
Omri
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
in
Samaria:
and
Ahab
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
016:029
And
in
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah
began
Ahab
the
son
of
Omri
to
reign
over
Israel:
and
Ahab
the
son
of
Omri
reigned
over
Israel
in
Samaria
twenty
and
two
years.
016:030
And
Ahab
the
son
of
Omri
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
above
all
that
were
before
him.
016:031
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
if
it
had
been
a
light
thing
for
him
to
walk
in
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
that
he
took
to
wife
Jezebel
the
daughter
of
Ethbaal
king
of
the
Zidonians,
and
went
and
served
Baal,
and
worshipped
him.
016:032
And
he
reared
up
an
altar
for
Baal
in
the
house
of
Baal,
which
he
had
built
in
Samaria.
016:033
And
Ahab
made
a
grove;
and
Ahab
did
more
to
provoke
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
to
anger
than
all
the
kings
of
Israel
that
were
before
him.
016:034
In
his
days
did
Hiel
the
Bethelite
build
Jericho:
he
laid
the
foundation
thereof
in
Abiram
his
firstborn,
and
set
up
the
gates
thereof
in
his
youngest
son
Segub,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
by
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun.
017:001
And
Elijah
the
Tishbite,
who
was
of
the
inhabitants
of
Gilead,
said
unto
Ahab,
As
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
liveth,
before
whom
I
stand,
there
shall
not
be
dew
nor
rain
these
years,
but
according
to
my
word.
017:002
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
him,
saying,
017:003
Get
thee
hence,
and
turn
thee
eastward,
and
hide
thyself
by
the
brook
Cherith,
that
is
before
Jordan.
017:004
And
it
shall
be,
that
thou
shalt
drink
of
the
brook;
and
I
have
commanded
the
ravens
to
feed
thee
there.
017:005
So
he
went
and
did
according
unto
the
word
of
the
LORD:
for
he
went
and
dwelt
by
the
brook
Cherith,
that
is
before
Jordan.
017:006
And
the
ravens
brought
him
bread
and
flesh
in
the
morning,
and
bread
and
flesh
in
the
evening;
and
he
drank
of
the
brook.
017:007
And
it
came
to
pass
after
a
while,
that
the
brook
dried
up,
because
there
had
been
no
rain
in
the
land.
017:008
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
him,
saying,
017:009
Arise,
get
thee
to
Zarephath,
which
belongeth
to
Zidon,
and
dwell
there:
behold,
I
have
commanded
a
widow
woman
there
to
sustain
thee.
017:010
So
he
arose
and
went
to
Zarephath.
And
when
he
came
to
the
gate
of
the
city,
behold,
the
widow
woman
was
