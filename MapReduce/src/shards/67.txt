he
was
gone.
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
him,
So
shall
thy
judgment
be;
thyself
hast
decided
it.
020:041
And
he
hasted,
and
took
the
ashes
away
from
his
face;
and
the
king
of
Israel
discerned
him
that
he
was
of
the
prophets.
020:042
And
he
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Because
thou
hast
let
go
out
of
thy
hand
a
man
whom
I
appointed
to
utter
destruction,
therefore
thy
life
shall
go
for
his
life,
and
thy
people
for
his
people.
020:043
And
the
king
of
Israel
went
to
his
house
heavy
and
displeased,
and
came
to
Samaria.
021:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things,
that
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
had
a
vineyard,
which
was
in
Jezreel,
hard
by
the
palace
of
Ahab
king
of
Samaria.
021:002
And
Ahab
spake
unto
Naboth,
saying,
Give
me
thy
vineyard,
that
I
may
have
it
for
a
garden
of
herbs,
because
it
is
near
unto
my
house:
and
I
will
give
thee
for
it
a
better
vineyard
than
it;
or,
if
it
seem
good
to
thee,
I
will
give
thee
the
worth
of
it
in
money.
021:003
And
Naboth
said
to
Ahab,
The
LORD
forbid
it
me,
that
I
should
give
the
inheritance
of
my
fathers
unto
thee.
021:004
And
Ahab
came
into
his
house
heavy
and
displeased
because
of
the
word
which
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
had
spoken
to
him:
for
he
had
said,
I
will
not
give
thee
the
inheritance
of
my
fathers.
And
he
laid
him
down
upon
his
bed,
and
turned
away
his
face,
and
would
eat
no
bread.
021:005
But
Jezebel
his
wife
came
to
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Why
is
thy
spirit
so
sad,
that
thou
eatest
no
bread?
021:006
And
he
said
unto
her,
Because
I
spake
unto
Naboth
the
Jezreelite,
and
said
unto
him,
Give
me
thy
vineyard
for
money;
or
else,
if
it
please
thee,
I
will
give
thee
another
vineyard
for
it:
and
he
answered,
I
will
not
give
thee
my
vineyard.
021:007
And
Jezebel
his
wife
said
unto
him,
Dost
thou
now
govern
the
kingdom
of
Israel?
arise,
and
eat
bread,
and
let
thine
heart
be
merry:
I
will
give
thee
the
vineyard
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite.
021:008
So
she
wrote
letters
in
Ahab's
name,
and
sealed
them
with
his
seal,
and
sent
the
letters
unto
the
elders
and
to
the
nobles
that
were
in
his
city,
dwelling
with
Naboth.
021:009
And
she
wrote
in
the
letters,
saying,
Proclaim
a
fast,
and
set
Naboth
on
high
among
the
people:
021:010
And
set
two
men,
sons
of
Belial,
before
him,
to
bear
witness
against
him,
saying,
Thou
didst
blaspheme
God
and
the
king.
And
then
carry
him
out,
and
stone
him,
that
he
may
die.
021:011
And
the
men
of
his
city,
even
the
elders
and
the
nobles
who
were
the
inhabitants
in
his
city,
did
as
Jezebel
had
sent
unto
them,
and
as
it
was
written
in
the
letters
which
she
had
sent
unto
them.
021:012
They
proclaimed
a
fast,
and
set
Naboth
on
high
among
the
people.
021:013
And
there
came
in
two
men,
children
of
Belial,
and
sat
before
him:
and
the
men
of
Belial
witnessed
against
him,
even
against
Naboth,
in
the
presence
of
the
people,
saying,
Naboth
did
blaspheme
God
and
the
king.
Then
they
carried
him
forth
out
of
the
city,
and
stoned
him
with
stones,
that
he
died.
021:014
Then
they
sent
to
Jezebel,
saying,
Naboth
is
stoned,
and
is
dead.
021:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Jezebel
heard
that
Naboth
was
stoned,
and
was
dead,
that
Jezebel
said
to
Ahab,
Arise,
take
possession
of
the
vineyard
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite,
which
he
refused
to
give
thee
for
money:
for
Naboth
is
not
alive,
but
dead.
021:016
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Ahab
heard
that
Naboth
was
dead,
that
Ahab
rose
up
to
go
down
to
the
vineyard
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite,
to
take
possession
of
it.
021:017
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Elijah
the
Tishbite,
saying,
021:018
Arise,
go
down
to
meet
Ahab
king
of
Israel,
which
is
in
Samaria:
behold,
he
is
in
the
vineyard
of
Naboth,
whither
he
is
gone
down
to
possess
it.
021:019
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Hast
thou
killed,
and
also
taken
possession?
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
In
the
place
where
dogs
licked
the
blood
of
Naboth
shall
dogs
lick
thy
blood,
even
thine.
021:020
And
Ahab
said
to
Elijah,
Hast
thou
found
me,
O
mine
enemy?
And
he
answered,
I
have
found
thee:
because
thou
hast
sold
thyself
to
work
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD.
021:021
Behold,
I
will
bring
evil
upon
thee,
and
will
take
away
thy
posterity,
and
will
cut
off
from
Ahab
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall,
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
Israel,
021:022
And
will
make
thine
house
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
and
like
the
house
of
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah,
for
the
provocation
wherewith
thou
hast
provoked
me
to
anger,
and
made
Israel
to
sin.
021:023
And
of
Jezebel
also
spake
the
LORD,
saying,
The
dogs
shall
eat
Jezebel
by
the
wall
of
Jezreel.
021:024
Him
that
dieth
of
Ahab
in
the
city
the
dogs
shall
eat;
and
him
that
dieth
in
the
field
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat.
021:025
But
there
was
none
like
unto
Ahab,
which
did
sell
himself
to
work
wickedness
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
whom
Jezebel
his
wife
stirred
up.
021:026
And
he
did
very
abominably
in
following
idols,
according
to
all
things
as
did
the
Amorites,
whom
the
LORD
cast
out
before
the
children
of
Israel.
021:027
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Ahab
heard
those
words,
that
he
rent
his
clothes,
and
put
sackcloth
upon
his
flesh,
and
fasted,
and
lay
in
sackcloth,
and
went
softly.
021:028
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Elijah
the
Tishbite,
saying,
021:029
Seest
thou
how
Ahab
humbleth
himself
before
me?
because
he
humbleth
himself
before
me,
I
will
not
bring
the
evil
in
his
days:
but
in
his
son's
days
will
I
bring
the
evil
upon
his
house.
022:001
And
they
continued
three
years
without
war
between
Syria
and
Israel.
022:002
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
third
year,
that
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
came
down
to
the
king
of
Israel.
022:003
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
his
servants,
Know
ye
that
Ramoth
in
Gilead
is
ours,
and
we
be
still,
and
take
it
not
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Syria?
022:004
And
he
said
unto
Jehoshaphat,
Wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
battle
to
Ramothgilead?
And
Jehoshaphat
said
to
the
king
of
Israel,
I
am
as
thou
art,
my
people
as
thy
people,
my
horses
as
thy
horses.
022:005
And
Jehoshaphat
said
unto
the
king
of
Israel,
Enquire,
I
pray
thee,
at
the
word
of
the
LORD
to
day.
022:006
Then
the
king
of
Israel
gathered
the
prophets
together,
about
four
hundred
men,
and
said
unto
them,
Shall
I
go
against
Ramothgilead
to
battle,
or
shall
I
forbear?
And
they
said,
Go
up;
for
the
LORD
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king.
022:007
And
Jehoshaphat
said,
Is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
LORD
besides,
that
we
might
enquire
of
him?
022:008
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
Jehoshaphat,
There
is
yet
one
man,
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imlah,
by
whom
we
may
enquire
of
the
LORD:
but
I
hate
him;
for
he
doth
not
prophesy
good
concerning
me,
but
evil.
And
Jehoshaphat
said,
Let
not
the
king
say
so.
022:009
Then
the
king
of
Israel
called
an
officer,
and
said,
Hasten
hither
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imlah.
022:010
And
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
sat
each
on
his
throne,
having
put
on
their
robes,
in
a
void
place
in
the
entrance
of
the
gate
of
Samaria;
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
before
them.
022:011
And
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
made
him
horns
of
iron:
and
he
said,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
With
these
shalt
thou
push
the
Syrians,
until
thou
have
consumed
them.
022:012
And
all
the
prophets
prophesied
so,
saying,
Go
up
to
Ramothgilead,
and
prosper:
for
the
LORD
shall
deliver
it
into
the
king's
hand.
022:013
And
the
messenger
that
was
gone
to
call
Micaiah
spake
unto
him,
saying,
Behold
now,
the
words
of
the
prophets
declare
good
unto
the
king
with
one
mouth:
let
thy
word,
I
pray
thee,
be
like
the
word
of
one
of
them,
and
speak
that
which
is
good.
022:014
And
Micaiah
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
what
the
LORD
saith
unto
me,
that
will
I
speak.
022:015
So
he
came
to
the
king.
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
Micaiah,
shall
we
go
against
Ramothgilead
to
battle,
or
shall
we
forbear?
And
he
answered
him,
Go,
and
prosper:
for
the
LORD
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king.
022:016
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
How
many
times
shall
I
adjure
thee
that
thou
tell
me
nothing
but
that
which
is
true
in
the
name
of
the
LORD?
022:017
And
he
said,
I
saw
all
Israel
scattered
upon
the
hills,
as
sheep
that
have
not
a
shepherd:
and
the
LORD
said,
These
have
no
master:
let
them
return
every
man
to
his
house
in
peace.
022:018
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
Jehoshaphat,
Did
I
not
tell
thee
that
he
would
prophesy
no
good
concerning
me,
but
evil?
022:019
And
he
said,
Hear
thou
therefore
the
word
of
the
LORD:
I
saw
the
LORD
sitting
on
his
throne,
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
standing
by
him
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left.
022:020
And
the
LORD
said,
Who
shall
persuade
Ahab,
that
he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
Ramothgilead?
And
one
said
on
this
manner,
and
another
said
on
that
manner.
022:021
And
there
came
forth
a
spirit,
and
stood
before
the
LORD,
and
said,
I
will
persuade
him.
022:022
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Wherewith?
And
he
said,
I
will
go
forth,
and
I
will
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets.
And
he
said,
Thou
shalt
persude
him,
and
prevail
also:
go
forth,
and
do
so.
022:023
Now
therefore,
behold,
the
LORD
hath
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
these
thy
prophets,
and
the
LORD
hath
spoken
evil
concerning
thee.
022:024
But
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
went
near,
and
smote
Micaiah
on
the
cheek,
and
said,
Which
way
went
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
from
me
to
speak
unto
thee?
022:025
And
Micaiah
said,
Behold,
thou
shalt
see
in
that
day,
when
thou
shalt
go
into
an
inner
chamber
to
hide
thyself.
022:026
And
the
king
of
Israel
said,
Take
Micaiah,
and
carry
him
back
unto
Amon
the
governor
of
the
city,
and
to
Joash
the
king's
son;
022:027
And
say,
Thus
saith
the
king,
Put
this
fellow
in
the
prison,
and
feed
him
with
bread
of
affliction
and
with
water
of
affliction,
until
I
come
in
peace.
022:028
And
Micaiah
said,
If
thou
return
at
all
in
peace,
the
LORD
hath
not
spoken
by
me.
And
he
said,
Hearken,
O
people,
every
one
of
you.
022:029
So
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
went
up
to
Ramothgilead.
022:030
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
Jehoshaphat,
I
will
disguise
myself,
and
enter
into
the
battle;
but
put
thou
on
thy
robes.
And
the
king
of
Israel
disguised
himself,
and
went
into
the
battle.
022:031
But
the
king
of
Syria
commanded
his
thirty
and
two
captains
that
had
rule
over
his
chariots,
saying,
Fight
neither
with
small
nor
great,
save
only
with
the
king
of
Israel.
022:032
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
saw
Jehoshaphat,
that
they
said,
Surely
it
is
the
king
of
Israel.
And
they
turned
aside
to
fight
against
him:
and
Jehoshaphat
cried
out.
022:033
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
perceived
that
it
was
not
the
king
of
Israel,
that
they
turned
back
from
pursuing
him.
022:034
And
a
certain
man
drew
a
bow
at
a
venture,
and
smote
the
king
of
Israel
between
the
joints
of
the
harness:
wherefore
he
said
unto
the
driver
of
his
chariot,
Turn
thine
hand,
and
carry
me
out
of
the
host;
for
I
am
wounded.
022:035
And
the
battle
increased
that
day:
and
the
king
was
stayed
up
in
his
chariot
against
the
Syrians,
and
died
at
even:
and
the
blood
ran
out
of
the
wound
into
the
midst
of
the
chariot.
022:036
And
there
went
a
proclamation
throughout
the
host
about
the
going
down
of
the
sun,
saying,
Every
man
to
his
city,
and
every
man
to
his
own
country.
022:037
So
the
king
died,
and
was
brought
to
Samaria;
and
they
buried
the
king
in
Samaria.
022:038
And
one
washed
the
chariot
in
the
pool
of
Samaria;
and
the
dogs
licked
up
his
blood;
and
they
washed
his
armour;
according
unto
the
word
of
the
LORD
which
he
spake.
022:039
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Ahab,
and
all
that
he
did,
and
the
ivory
house
which
he
made,
and
all
the
cities
that
he
built,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
022:040
So
Ahab
slept
with
his
fathers;
and
Ahaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
022:041
And
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Asa
began
to
reign
over
Judah
in
the
fourth
year
of
Ahab
king
of
Israel.
022:042
Jehoshaphat
was
thirty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign;
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
five
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Azubah
the
daughter
of
Shilhi.
022:043
And
he
walked
in
all
the
ways
of
Asa
his
father;
he
turned
not
aside
from
it,
doing
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD:
nevertheless
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away;
for
the
people
offered
and
burnt
incense
yet
in
the
high
places.
022:044
And
Jehoshaphat
made
peace
with
the
king
of
Israel.
022:045
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jehoshaphat,
and
his
might
that
he
shewed,
and
how
he
warred,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
022:046
And
the
remnant
of
the
sodomites,
which
remained
in
the
days
of
his
father
Asa,
he
took
out
of
the
land.
022:047
There
was
then
no
king
in
Edom:
a
deputy
was
king.
022:048
Jehoshaphat
made
ships
of
Tharshish
to
go
to
Ophir
for
gold:
but
they
went
not;
for
the
ships
were
broken
at
Eziongeber.
022:049
Then
said
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Ahab
unto
Jehoshaphat,
Let
my
servants
go
with
thy
servants
in
the
ships.
But
Jehoshaphat
would
not.
022:050
And
Jehoshaphat
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David
his
father:
and
Jehoram
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
022:051
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Ahab
began
to
reign
over
Israel
in
Samaria
the
seventeenth
year
of
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Judah,
and
reigned
two
years
over
Israel.
022:052
And
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
walked
in
the
way
of
his
father,
and
in
the
way
of
his
mother,
and
in
the
way
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
to
sin:
022:053
For
he
served
Baal,
and
worshipped
him,
and
provoked
to
anger
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
according
to
all
that
his
father
had
done.

12	2
Kings
001:001
Then
Moab
rebelled
against
Israel
after
the
death
of
Ahab.
001:002
And
Ahaziah
fell
down
through
a
lattice
in
his
upper
chamber
that
was
in
Samaria,
and
was
sick:
and
he
sent
messengers,
and
said
unto
them,
Go,
enquire
of
Baalzebub
the
god
of
Ekron
whether
I
shall
recover
of
this
disease.
001:003
But
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
to
Elijah
the
Tishbite,
Arise,
go
up
to
meet
the
messengers
of
the
king
of
Samaria,
and
say
unto
them,
Is
it
not
because
there
is
not
a
God
in
Israel,
that
ye
go
to
enquire
of
Baalzebub
the
god
of
Ekron?
001:004
Now
therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Thou
shalt
not
come
down
from
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up,
but
shalt
surely
die.
And
Elijah
departed.
001:005
And
when
the
messengers
turned
back
unto
him,
he
said
unto
them,
Why
are
ye
now
turned
back?
001:006
And
they
said
unto
him,
There
came
a
man
up
to
meet
us,
and
said
unto
us,
Go,
turn
again
unto
the
king
that
sent
you,
and
say
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Is
it
not
because
there
is
not
a
God
in
Israel,
that
thou
sendest
to
enquire
of
Baalzebub
the
god
of
Ekron?
therefore
thou
shalt
not
come
down
from
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up,
but
shalt
surely
die.
001:007
And
he
said
unto
them,
What
manner
of
man
was
he
which
came
up
to
meet
you,
and
told
you
these
words?
001:008
And
they
answered
him,
He
was
an
hairy
man,
and
girt
with
a
girdle
of
leather
about
his
loins.
And
he
said,
It
is
Elijah
the
Tishbite.
001:009
Then
the
king
sent
unto
him
a
captain
of
fifty
with
his
fifty.
And
he
went
up
to
him:
and,
behold,
he
sat
on
the
top
of
an
hill.
And
he
spake
unto
him,
Thou
man
of
God,
the
king
hath
said,
Come
down.
001:010
And
Elijah
answered
and
said
to
the
captain
of
fifty,
If
I
be
a
man
of
God,
then
let
fire
come
down
from
heaven,
and
consume
thee
and
thy
fifty.
And
there
came
down
fire
from
heaven,
and
consumed
him
and
his
fifty.
001:011
Again
also
he
sent
unto
him
another
captain
of
fifty
with
his
fifty.
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
him,
O
man
of
God,
thus
hath
the
king
said,
Come
down
quickly.
001:012
And
Elijah
answered
and
said
unto
them,
If
I
be
a
man
of
God,
let
fire
come
down
from
heaven,
and
consume
thee
and
thy
fifty.
And
the
fire
of
God
came
down
from
heaven,
and
consumed
him
and
his
fifty.
001:013
And
he
sent
again
a
captain
of
the
third
fifty
with
his
fifty.
And
the
third
captain
of
fifty
went
up,
and
came
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
Elijah,
and
besought
him,
and
said
unto
him,
O
man
of
God,
I
pray
thee,
let
my
life,
and
the
life
of
these
fifty
thy
servants,
be
precious
in
thy
sight.
001:014
Behold,
there
came
fire
down
from
heaven,
and
burnt
up
the
two
captains
of
the
former
fifties
with
their
fifties:
therefore
let
my
life
now
be
precious
in
thy
sight.
001:015
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
Elijah,
Go
down
with
him:
be
not
afraid
of
him.
And
he
arose,
and
went
down
with
him
unto
the
king.
001:016
And
he
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Forasmuch
as
thou
hast
sent
messengers
to
enquire
of
Baalzebub
the
god
of
Ekron,
is
it
not
because
there
is
no
God
in
Israel
to
enquire
of
his
word?
therefore
thou
shalt
not
come
down
off
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up,
but
shalt
surely
die.
001:017
So
he
died
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
which
Elijah
had
spoken.
And
Jehoram
reigned
in
his
stead
in
the
second
year
of
Jehoram
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Judah;
because
he
had
no
son.
001:018
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Ahaziah
which
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
002:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
LORD
would
take
up
Elijah
into
heaven
by
a
whirlwind,
that
Elijah
went
with
Elisha
from
Gilgal.
002:002
And
Elijah
said
unto
Elisha,
Tarry
here,
I
pray
thee;
for
the
LORD
hath
sent
me
to
Bethel.
And
Elisha
said
unto
him,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
and
as
thy
soul
liveth,
I
will
not
leave
thee.
So
they
went
down
to
Bethel.
002:003
And
the
sons
of
the
prophets
that
were
at
Bethel
came
forth
to
Elisha,
and
said
unto
him,
Knowest
thou
that
the
LORD
will
take
away
thy
master
from
thy
head
to
day?
And
he
said,
Yea,
I
know
it;
hold
ye
your
peace.
002:004
And
Elijah
said
unto
him,
Elisha,
tarry
here,
I
pray
thee;
for
the
LORD
hath
sent
me
to
Jericho.
And
he
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
and
as
thy
soul
liveth,
I
will
not
leave
thee.
So
they
came
to
Jericho.
002:005
And
the
sons
of
the
prophets
that
were
at
Jericho
came
to
Elisha,
and
said
unto
him,
Knowest
thou
that
the
LORD
will
take
away
thy
master
from
thy
head
to
day?
And
he
answered,
Yea,
I
know
it;
hold
ye
your
peace.
002:006
And
Elijah
said
unto
him,
Tarry,
I
pray
thee,
here;
for
the
LORD
hath
sent
me
to
Jordan.
And
he
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
and
as
thy
soul
liveth,
I
will
not
leave
thee.
And
they
two
went
on.
002:007
And
fifty
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
went,
and
stood
to
view
afar
off:
and
they
two
stood
by
Jordan.
002:008
And
Elijah
took
his
mantle,
and
wrapped
it
together,
and
smote
the
waters,
and
they
were
divided
hither
and
thither,
so
that
they
two
went
over
on
dry
ground.
002:009
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
were
gone
over,
that
Elijah
said
unto
Elisha,
Ask
what
I
shall
do
for
thee,
before
I
be
taken
away
from
thee.
And
Elisha
said,
I
pray
thee,
let
a
double
portion
of
thy
spirit
be
upon
me.
002:010
And
he
said,
Thou
hast
asked
a
hard
thing:
nevertheless,
if
thou
see
me
when
I
am
taken
from
thee,
it
shall
be
so
unto
thee;
but
if
not,
it
shall
not
be
so.
002:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
still
went
on,
and
talked,
that,
behold,
there
appeared
a
chariot
of
fire,
and
horses
of
fire,
and
parted
them
both
asunder;
and
Elijah
went
up
by
a
whirlwind
into
heaven.
002:012
And
Elisha
saw
it,
and
he
cried,
My
father,
my
father,
the
chariot
of
Israel,
and
the
horsemen
thereof.
And
he
saw
him
no
more:
and
he
took
hold
of
his
own
clothes,
and
rent
them
in
two
pieces.
002:013
He
took
up
also
the
mantle
of
Elijah
that
fell
from
him,
and
went
back,
and
stood
by
the
bank
of
Jordan;
002:014
And
he
took
the
mantle
of
Elijah
that
fell
from
him,
and
smote
the
waters,
and
said,
Where
is
the
LORD
God
of
Elijah?
and
when
he
also
had
smitten
the
waters,
they
parted
hither
and
thither:
and
Elisha
went
over.
002:015
And
when
the
sons
of
the
prophets
which
were
to
view
at
Jericho
saw
him,
they
said,
The
spirit
of
Elijah
doth
rest
on
Elisha.
And
they
came
to
meet
him,
and
bowed
themselves
to
the
ground
before
him.
002:016
And
they
said
unto
him,
Behold
now,
there
be
with
thy
servants
fifty
strong
men;
let
them
go,
we
pray
thee,
and
seek
thy
master:
lest
peradventure
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
hath
taken
him
up,
and
cast
him
upon
some
mountain,
or
into
some
valley.
And
he
said,
Ye
shall
not
send.
002:017
And
when
they
urged
him
till
he
was
ashamed,
he
said,
Send.
They
sent
therefore
fifty
men;
and
they
sought
three
days,
but
found
him
not.
002:018
And
when
they
came
again
to
him,
(for
he
tarried
at
Jericho,)
he
said
unto
them,
Did
I
not
say
unto
you,
Go
not?
002:019
And
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
Elisha,
Behold,
I
pray
thee,
the
situation
of
this
city
is
pleasant,
as
my
lord
seeth:
but
the
water
is
naught,
and
the
ground
barren.
002:020
And
he
said,
Bring
me
a
new
cruse,
and
put
salt
therein.
And
they
brought
it
to
him.
002:021
And
he
went
forth
unto
the
spring
of
the
waters,
and
cast
the
salt
in
there,
and
said,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
I
have
healed
these
waters;
there
shall
not
be
from
thence
any
more
death
or
barren
land.
002:022
So
the
waters
were
healed
unto
this
day,
according
to
the
saying
of
Elisha
which
he
spake.
002:023
And
he
went
up
from
thence
unto
Bethel:
and
as
he
was
going
up
by
the
way,
there
came
