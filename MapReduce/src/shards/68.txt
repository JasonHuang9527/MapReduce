forth
little
children
out
of
the
city,
and
mocked
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Go
up,
thou
bald
head;
go
up,
thou
bald
head.
002:024
And
he
turned
back,
and
looked
on
them,
and
cursed
them
in
the
name
of
the
LORD.
And
there
came
forth
two
she
bears
out
of
the
wood,
and
tare
forty
and
two
children
of
them.
002:025
And
he
went
from
thence
to
mount
Carmel,
and
from
thence
he
returned
to
Samaria.
003:001
Now
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
began
to
reign
over
Israel
in
Samaria
the
eighteenth
year
of
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Judah,
and
reigned
twelve
years.
003:002
And
he
wrought
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD;
but
not
like
his
father,
and
like
his
mother:
for
he
put
away
the
image
of
Baal
that
his
father
had
made.
003:003
Nevertheless
he
cleaved
unto
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
which
made
Israel
to
sin;
he
departed
not
therefrom.
003:004
And
Mesha
king
of
Moab
was
a
sheepmaster,
and
rendered
unto
the
king
of
Israel
an
hundred
thousand
lambs,
and
an
hundred
thousand
rams,
with
the
wool.
003:005
But
it
came
to
pass,
when
Ahab
was
dead,
that
the
king
of
Moab
rebelled
against
the
king
of
Israel.
003:006
And
king
Jehoram
went
out
of
Samaria
the
same
time,
and
numbered
all
Israel.
003:007
And
he
went
and
sent
to
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah,
saying,
The
king
of
Moab
hath
rebelled
against
me:
wilt
thou
go
with
me
against
Moab
to
battle?
And
he
said,
I
will
go
up:
I
am
as
thou
art,
my
people
as
thy
people,
and
my
horses
as
thy
horses.
003:008
And
he
said,
Which
way
shall
we
go
up?
And
he
answered,
The
way
through
the
wilderness
of
Edom.
003:009
So
the
king
of
Israel
went,
and
the
king
of
Judah,
and
the
king
of
Edom:
and
they
fetched
a
compass
of
seven
days'
journey:
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
host,
and
for
the
cattle
that
followed
them.
003:010
And
the
king
of
Israel
said,
Alas!
that
the
LORD
hath
called
these
three
kings
together,
to
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
Moab!
003:011
But
Jehoshaphat
said,
Is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
LORD,
that
we
may
enquire
of
the
LORD
by
him?
And
one
of
the
king
of
Israel's
servants
answered
and
said,
Here
is
Elisha
the
son
of
Shaphat,
which
poured
water
on
the
hands
of
Elijah.
003:012
And
Jehoshaphat
said,
The
word
of
the
LORD
is
with
him.
So
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
and
the
king
of
Edom
went
down
to
him.
003:013
And
Elisha
said
unto
the
king
of
Israel,
What
have
I
to
do
with
thee?
get
thee
to
the
prophets
of
thy
father,
and
to
the
prophets
of
thy
mother.
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
him,
Nay:
for
the
LORD
hath
called
these
three
kings
together,
to
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
Moab.
003:014
And
Elisha
said,
As
the
LORD
of
hosts
liveth,
before
whom
I
stand,
surely,
were
it
not
that
I
regard
the
presence
of
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah,
I
would
not
look
toward
thee,
nor
see
thee.
003:015
But
now
bring
me
a
minstrel.
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
minstrel
played,
that
the
hand
of
the
LORD
came
upon
him.
003:016
And
he
said,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Make
this
valley
full
of
ditches.
003:017
For
thus
saith
the
LORD,
Ye
shall
not
see
wind,
neither
shall
ye
see
rain;
yet
that
valley
shall
be
filled
with
water,
that
ye
may
drink,
both
ye,
and
your
cattle,
and
your
beasts.
003:018
And
this
is
but
a
light
thing
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
he
will
deliver
the
Moabites
also
into
your
hand.
003:019
And
ye
shall
smite
every
fenced
city,
and
every
choice
city,
and
shall
fell
every
good
tree,
and
stop
all
wells
of
water,
and
mar
every
good
piece
of
land
with
stones.
003:020
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning,
when
the
meat
offering
was
offered,
that,
behold,
there
came
water
by
the
way
of
Edom,
and
the
country
was
filled
with
water.
003:021
And
when
all
the
Moabites
heard
that
the
kings
were
come
up
to
fight
against
them,
they
gathered
all
that
were
able
to
put
on
armour,
and
upward,
and
stood
in
the
border.
003:022
And
they
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
the
sun
shone
upon
the
water,
and
the
Moabites
saw
the
water
on
the
other
side
as
red
as
blood:
003:023
And
they
said,
This
is
blood:
the
kings
are
surely
slain,
and
they
have
smitten
one
another:
now
therefore,
Moab,
to
the
spoil.
003:024
And
when
they
came
to
the
camp
of
Israel,
the
Israelites
rose
up
and
smote
the
Moabites,
so
that
they
fled
before
them:
but
they
went
forward
smiting
the
Moabites,
even
in
their
country.
003:025
And
they
beat
down
the
cities,
and
on
every
good
piece
of
land
cast
every
man
his
stone,
and
filled
it;
and
they
stopped
all
the
wells
of
water,
and
felled
all
the
good
trees:
only
in
Kirharaseth
left
they
the
stones
thereof;
howbeit
the
slingers
went
about
it,
and
smote
it.
003:026
And
when
the
king
of
Moab
saw
that
the
battle
was
too
sore
for
him,
he
took
with
him
seven
hundred
men
that
drew
swords,
to
break
through
even
unto
the
king
of
Edom:
but
they
could
not.
003:027
Then
he
took
his
eldest
son
that
should
have
reigned
in
his
stead,
and
offered
him
for
a
burnt
offering
upon
the
wall.
And
there
was
great
indignation
against
Israel:
and
they
departed
from
him,
and
returned
to
their
own
land.
004:001
Now
there
cried
a
certain
woman
of
the
wives
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
unto
Elisha,
saying,
Thy
servant
my
husband
is
dead;
and
thou
knowest
that
thy
servant
did
fear
the
LORD:
and
the
creditor
is
come
to
take
unto
him
my
two
sons
to
be
bondmen.
004:002
And
Elisha
said
unto
her,
What
shall
I
do
for
thee?
tell
me,
what
hast
thou
in
the
house?
And
she
said,
Thine
handmaid
hath
not
any
thing
in
the
house,
save
a
pot
of
oil.
004:003
Then
he
said,
Go,
borrow
thee
vessels
abroad
of
all
thy
neighbours,
even
empty
vessels;
borrow
not
a
few.
004:004
And
when
thou
art
come
in,
thou
shalt
shut
the
door
upon
thee
and
upon
thy
sons,
and
shalt
pour
out
into
all
those
vessels,
and
thou
shalt
set
aside
that
which
is
full.
004:005
So
she
went
from
him,
and
shut
the
door
upon
her
and
upon
her
sons,
who
brought
the
vessels
to
her;
and
she
poured
out.
004:006
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
vessels
were
full,
that
she
said
unto
her
son,
Bring
me
yet
a
vessel.
And
he
said
unto
her,
There
is
not
a
vessel
more.
And
the
oil
stayed.
004:007
Then
she
came
and
told
the
man
of
God.
And
he
said,
Go,
sell
the
oil,
and
pay
thy
debt,
and
live
thou
and
thy
children
of
the
rest.
004:008
And
it
fell
on
a
day,
that
Elisha
passed
to
Shunem,
where
was
a
great
woman;
and
she
constrained
him
to
eat
bread.
And
so
it
was,
that
as
oft
as
he
passed
by,
he
turned
in
thither
to
eat
bread.
004:009
And
she
said
unto
her
husband,
Behold
now,
I
perceive
that
this
is
an
holy
man
of
God,
which
passeth
by
us
continually.
004:010
Let
us
make
a
little
chamber,
I
pray
thee,
on
the
wall;
and
let
us
set
for
him
there
a
bed,
and
a
table,
and
a
stool,
and
a
candlestick:
and
it
shall
be,
when
he
cometh
to
us,
that
he
shall
turn
in
thither.
004:011
And
it
fell
on
a
day,
that
he
came
thither,
and
he
turned
into
the
chamber,
and
lay
there.
004:012
And
he
said
to
Gehazi
his
servant,
Call
this
Shunammite.
And
when
he
had
called
her,
she
stood
before
him.
004:013
And
he
said
unto
him,
Say
now
unto
her,
Behold,
thou
hast
been
careful
for
us
with
all
this
care;
what
is
to
be
done
for
thee?
wouldest
thou
be
spoken
for
to
the
king,
or
to
the
captain
of
the
host?
And
she
answered,
I
dwell
among
mine
own
people.
004:014
And
he
said,
What
then
is
to
be
done
for
her?
And
Gehazi
answered,
Verily
she
hath
no
child,
and
her
husband
is
old.
004:015
And
he
said,
Call
her.
And
when
he
had
called
her,
she
stood
in
the
door.
004:016
And
he
said,
About
this
season,
according
to
the
time
of
life,
thou
shalt
embrace
a
son.
And
she
said,
Nay,
my
lord,
thou
man
of
God,
do
not
lie
unto
thine
handmaid.
004:017
And
the
woman
conceived,
and
bare
a
son
at
that
season
that
Elisha
had
said
unto
her,
according
to
the
time
of
life.
004:018
And
when
the
child
was
grown,
it
fell
on
a
day,
that
he
went
out
to
his
father
to
the
reapers.
004:019
And
he
said
unto
his
father,
My
head,
my
head.
And
he
said
to
a
lad,
Carry
him
to
his
mother.
004:020
And
when
he
had
taken
him,
and
brought
him
to
his
mother,
he
sat
on
her
knees
till
noon,
and
then
died.
004:021
And
she
went
up,
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
of
the
man
of
God,
and
shut
the
door
upon
him,
and
went
out.
004:022
And
she
called
unto
her
husband,
and
said,
Send
me,
I
pray
thee,
one
of
the
young
men,
and
one
of
the
asses,
that
I
may
run
to
the
man
of
God,
and
come
again.
004:023
And
he
said,
Wherefore
wilt
thou
go
to
him
to
day?
it
is
neither
new
moon,
nor
sabbath.
And
she
said,
It
shall
be
well.
004:024
Then
she
saddled
an
ass,
and
said
to
her
servant,
Drive,
and
go
forward;
slack
not
thy
riding
for
me,
except
I
bid
thee.
004:025
So
she
went
and
came
unto
the
man
of
God
to
mount
Carmel.
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
man
of
God
saw
her
afar
off,
that
he
said
to
Gehazi
his
servant,
Behold,
yonder
is
that
Shunammite:
004:026
Run
now,
I
pray
thee,
to
meet
her,
and
say
unto
her,
Is
it
well
with
thee?
is
it
well
with
thy
husband?
is
it
well
with
the
child?
And
she
answered,
It
is
well:
004:027
And
when
she
came
to
the
man
of
God
to
the
hill,
she
caught
him
by
the
feet:
but
Gehazi
came
near
to
thrust
her
away.
And
the
man
of
God
said,
Let
her
alone;
for
her
soul
is
vexed
within
her:
and
the
LORD
hath
hid
it
from
me,
and
hath
not
told
me.
004:028
Then
she
said,
Did
I
desire
a
son
of
my
lord?
did
I
not
say,
Do
not
deceive
me?
004:029
Then
he
said
to
Gehazi,
Gird
up
thy
loins,
and
take
my
staff
in
thine
hand,
and
go
thy
way:
if
thou
meet
any
man,
salute
him
not;
and
if
any
salute
thee,
answer
him
not
again:
and
lay
my
staff
upon
the
face
of
the
child.
004:030
And
the
mother
of
the
child
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
and
as
thy
soul
liveth,
I
will
not
leave
thee.
And
he
arose,
and
followed
her.
004:031
And
Gehazi
passed
on
before
them,
and
laid
the
staff
upon
the
face
of
the
child;
but
there
was
neither
voice,
nor
hearing.
Wherefore
he
went
again
to
meet
him,
and
told
him,
saying,
The
child
is
not
awaked.
004:032
And
when
Elisha
was
come
into
the
house,
behold,
the
child
was
dead,
and
laid
upon
his
bed.
004:033
He
went
in
therefore,
and
shut
the
door
upon
them
twain,
and
prayed
unto
the
LORD.
004:034
And
he
went
up,
and
lay
upon
the
child,
and
put
his
mouth
upon
his
mouth,
and
his
eyes
upon
his
eyes,
and
his
hands
upon
his
hands:
and
stretched
himself
upon
the
child;
and
the
flesh
of
the
child
waxed
warm.
004:035
Then
he
returned,
and
walked
in
the
house
to
and
fro;
and
went
up,
and
stretched
himself
upon
him:
and
the
child
sneezed
seven
times,
and
the
child
opened
his
eyes.
004:036
And
he
called
Gehazi,
and
said,
Call
this
Shunammite.
So
he
called
her.
And
when
she
was
come
in
unto
him,
he
said,
Take
up
thy
son.
004:037
Then
she
went
in,
and
fell
at
his
feet,
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground,
and
took
up
her
son,
and
went
out.
004:038
And
Elisha
came
again
to
Gilgal:
and
there
was
a
dearth
in
the
land;
and
the
sons
of
the
prophets
were
sitting
before
him:
and
he
said
unto
his
servant,
Set
on
the
great
pot,
and
seethe
pottage
for
the
sons
of
the
prophets.
004:039
And
one
went
out
into
the
field
to
gather
herbs,
and
found
a
wild
vine,
and
gathered
thereof
wild
gourds
his
lap
full,
and
came
and
shred
them
into
the
pot
of
pottage:
for
they
knew
them
not.
004:040
So
they
poured
out
for
the
men
to
eat.
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
were
eating
of
the
pottage,
that
they
cried
out,
and
said,
O
thou
man
of
God,
there
is
death
in
the
pot.
And
they
could
not
eat
thereof.
004:041
But
he
said,
Then
bring
meal.
And
he
cast
it
into
the
pot;
and
he
said,
Pour
out
for
the
people,
that
they
may
eat.
And
there
was
no
harm
in
the
pot.
004:042
And
there
came
a
man
from
Baalshalisha,
and
brought
the
man
of
God
bread
of
the
firstfruits,
twenty
loaves
of
barley,
and
full
ears
of
corn
in
the
husk
thereof.
And
he
said,
Give
unto
the
people,
that
they
may
eat.
004:043
And
his
servitor
said,
What,
should
I
set
this
before
an
hundred
men?
He
said
again,
Give
the
people,
that
they
may
eat:
for
thus
saith
the
LORD,
They
shall
eat,
and
shall
leave
thereof.
004:044
So
he
set
it
before
them,
and
they
did
eat,
and
left
thereof,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD.
005:001
Now
Naaman,
captain
of
the
host
of
the
king
of
Syria,
was
a
great
man
with
his
master,
and
honourable,
because
by
him
the
LORD
had
given
deliverance
unto
Syria:
he
was
also
a
mighty
man
in
valour,
but
he
was
a
leper.
005:002
And
the
Syrians
had
gone
out
by
companies,
and
had
brought
away
captive
out
of
the
land
of
Israel
a
little
maid;
and
she
waited
on
Naaman's
wife.
005:003
And
she
said
unto
her
mistress,
Would
God
my
lord
were
with
the
prophet
that
is
in
Samaria!
for
he
would
recover
him
of
his
leprosy.
005:004
And
one
went
in,
and
told
his
lord,
saying,
Thus
and
thus
said
the
maid
that
is
of
the
land
of
Israel.
005:005
And
the
king
of
Syria
said,
Go
to,
go,
and
I
will
send
a
letter
unto
the
king
of
Israel.
And
he
departed,
and
took
with
him
ten
talents
of
silver,
and
six
thousand
pieces
of
gold,
and
ten
changes
of
raiment.
005:006
And
he
brought
the
letter
to
the
king
of
Israel,
saying,
Now
when
this
letter
is
come
unto
thee,
behold,
I
have
therewith
sent
Naaman
my
servant
to
thee,
that
thou
mayest
recover
him
of
his
leprosy.
005:007
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
king
of
Israel
had
read
the
letter,
that
he
rent
his
clothes,
and
said,
Am
I
God,
to
kill
and
to
make
alive,
that
this
man
doth
send
unto
me
to
recover
a
man
of
his
leprosy?
wherefore
consider,
I
pray
you,
and
see
how
he
seeketh
a
quarrel
against
me.
005:008
And
it
was
so,
when
Elisha
the
man
of
God
had
heard
that
the
king
of
Israel
had
rent
his
clothes,
that
he
sent
to
the
king,
saying,
Wherefore
hast
thou
rent
thy
clothes?
let
him
come
now
to
me,
and
he
shall
know
that
there
is
a
prophet
in
Israel.
005:009
So
Naaman
came
with
his
horses
and
with
his
chariot,
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
house
of
Elisha.
005:010
And
Elisha
sent
a
messenger
unto
him,
saying,
Go
and
wash
in
Jordan
seven
times,
and
thy
flesh
shall
come
again
to
thee,
and
thou
shalt
be
clean.
005:011
But
Naaman
was
wroth,
and
went
away,
and
said,
Behold,
I
thought,
He
will
surely
come
out
to
me,
and
stand,
and
call
on
the
name
of
the
LORD
his
God,
and
strike
his
hand
over
the
place,
and
recover
the
leper.
005:012
Are
not
Abana
and
Pharpar,
rivers
of
Damascus,
better
than
all
the
waters
of
Israel?
may
I
not
wash
in
them,
and
be
clean?
So
he
turned
and
went
away
in
a
rage.
005:013
And
his
servants
came
near,
and
spake
unto
him,
and
said,
My
father,
if
the
prophet
had
bid
thee
do
some
great
thing,
wouldest
thou
not
have
done
it?
how
much
rather
then,
when
he
saith
to
thee,
Wash,
and
be
clean?
005:014
Then
went
he
down,
and
dipped
himself
seven
times
in
Jordan,
according
to
the
saying
of
the
man
of
God:
and
his
flesh
came
again
like
unto
the
flesh
of
a
little
child,
and
he
was
clean.
005:015
And
he
returned
to
the
man
of
God,
he
and
all
his
company,
and
came,
and
stood
before
him:
and
he
said,
Behold,
now
I
know
that
there
is
no
God
in
all
the
earth,
but
in
Israel:
now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
take
a
blessing
of
thy
servant.
005:016
But
he
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
before
whom
I
stand,
I
will
receive
none.
And
he
urged
him
to
take
it;
but
he
refused.
005:017
And
Naaman
said,
Shall
there
not
then,
I
pray
thee,
be
given
to
thy
servant
two
mules'
burden
of
earth?
for
thy
servant
will
henceforth
offer
neither
burnt
offering
nor
sacrifice
unto
other
gods,
but
unto
the
LORD.
005:018
In
this
thing
the
LORD
pardon
thy
servant,
that
when
my
master
goeth
into
the
house
of
Rimmon
to
worship
there,
and
he
leaneth
on
my
hand,
and
I
bow
myself
in
the
house
of
Rimmon:
when
I
bow
down
myself
in
the
house
of
Rimmon,
the
LORD
pardon
thy
servant
in
this
thing.
005:019
And
he
said
unto
him,
Go
in
peace.
So
he
departed
from
him
a
little
way.
005:020
But
Gehazi,
the
servant
of
Elisha
the
man
of
God,
said,
Behold,
my
master
hath
spared
Naaman
this
Syrian,
in
not
receiving
at
his
hands
that
which
he
brought:
but,
as
the
LORD
liveth,
I
will
run
after
him,
and
take
somewhat
of
him.
005:021
So
Gehazi
followed
after
Naaman.
And
when
Naaman
saw
him
running
after
him,
he
lighted
down
from
the
chariot
to
meet
him,
and
said,
Is
all
well?
005:022
And
he
said,
All
is
well.
My
master
hath
sent
me,
saying,
Behold,
even
now
there
be
come
to
me
from
mount
Ephraim
two
young
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets:
give
them,
I
pray
thee,
a
talent
of
silver,
and
two
changes
of
garments.
005:023
And
Naaman
said,
Be
content,
take
two
talents.
And
he
urged
him,
and
bound
two
talents
of
silver
in
two
bags,
with
two
changes
of
garments,
and
laid
them
upon
two
of
his
servants;
and
they
bare
them
before
him.
005:024
And
when
he
came
to
the
tower,
he
took
them
from
their
hand,
and
bestowed
them
in
the
house:
and
he
let
the
men
go,
and
they
departed.
005:025
But
he
went
in,
and
stood
before
his
master.
And
Elisha
said
unto
him,
Whence
comest
thou,
Gehazi?
And
he
said,
Thy
servant
went
no
whither.
005:026
And
he
said
unto
him,
Went
not
mine
heart
with
thee,
when
the
man
turned
again
from
his
chariot
to
meet
thee?
Is
it
a
time
to
receive
money,
and
to
receive
garments,
and
oliveyards,
and
vineyards,
and
sheep,
and
oxen,
and
menservants,
and
maidservants?
005:027
The
leprosy
therefore
of
Naaman
shall
cleave
unto
thee,
and
unto
thy
seed
for
ever.
And
he
went
out
from
his
presence
a
leper
as
white
as
snow.
006:001
And
the
sons
of
the
prophets
said
unto
Elisha,
Behold
now,
the
place
where
we
dwell
with
thee
is
too
strait
for
us.
006:002
Let
us
go,
we
pray
thee,
unto
Jordan,
and
take
thence
every
man
a
beam,
and
let
us
make
us
a
place
there,
where
we
may
dwell.
And
he
answered,
Go
ye.
006:003
And
one
said,
Be
content,
I
pray
thee,
and
go
with
thy
servants.
And
he
answered,
I
will
go.
006:004
So
he
went
with
them.
And
when
they
came
to
Jordan,
they
cut
down
wood.
006:005
But
as
one
was
felling
a
beam,
the
axe
head
fell
into
the
water:
and
he
cried,
and
said,
Alas,
master!
for
it
was
borrowed.
006:006
And
the
man
of
God
said,
Where
fell
it?
And
he
shewed
him
the
place.
And
he
cut
down
a
stick,
and
cast
it
in
thither;
and
the
iron
did
swim.
006:007
Therefore
said
he,
Take
it
up
to
thee.
And
he
put
out
his
hand,
and
took
it.
006:008
Then
the
king
of
Syria
warred
against
Israel,
and
took
counsel
with
his
servants,
saying,
In
such
and
such
a
place
shall
be
my
camp.
006:009
And
the
man
of
God
sent
unto
the
king
of
Israel,
saying,
Beware
that
thou
pass
not
such
a
place;
for
thither
the
Syrians
are
come
down.
006:010
And
the
king
of
Israel
sent
to
the
place
which
the
man
of
God
told
him
and
warned
him
of,
and
saved
himself
there,
not
once
nor
twice.
006:011
Therefore
the
heart
of
the
king
of
Syria
was
sore
troubled
for
this
thing;
and
he
called
his
servants,
and
said
unto
them,
Will
ye
not
shew
me
which
of
us
is
for
the
king
of
Israel?
006:012
And
one
of
his
servants
said,
None,
my
lord,
O
king:
but
Elisha,
the
prophet
that
is
in
Israel,
telleth
the
king
of
Israel
the
words
that
thou
speakest
in
thy
bedchamber.
006:013
And
he
said,
Go
and
spy
where
he
is,
that
I
may
send
and
fetch
him.
And
it
was
told
him,
saying,
Behold,
he
is
in
Dothan.
006:014
Therefore
sent
he
thither
horses,
and
chariots,
and
a
great
host:
and
they
came
by
night,
and
compassed
the
city
about.
006:015
And
when
the
servant
of
the
man
of
God
was
risen
early,
and
gone
forth,
behold,
an
host
compassed
the
city
both
with
horses
and
chariots.
And
his
servant
said
unto
him,
Alas,
my
master!
how
shall
we
do?
006:016
And
he
answered,
Fear
not:
for
they
that
be
with
us
are
more
than
they
that
be
with
them.
006:017
And
Elisha
prayed,
and
said,
LORD,
I
pray
thee,
open
his
eyes,
that
he
may
see.
And
the
LORD
opened
the
eyes
of
the
young
man;
and
he
saw:
and,
behold,
the
mountain
was
full
of
horses
and
chariots
of
fire
round
about
Elisha.
006:018
And
when
they
came
down
to
him,
Elisha
prayed
unto
the
LORD,
and
said,
Smite
this
people,
I
pray
thee,
with
blindness.
And
he
smote
them
with
blindness
according
to
the
word
of
Elisha.
006:019
And
Elisha
said
unto
them,
This
is
not
the
way,
neither
is
this
the
city:
follow
me,
and
I
will
bring
you
to
the
man
whom
ye
seek.
But
he
led
them
to
Samaria.
006:020
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
were
come
into
Samaria,
that
Elisha
said,
LORD,
open
the
eyes
of
these
men,
that
they
may
see.
And
the
LORD
opened
their
eyes,
and
they
saw;
and,
behold,
they
were
in
the
midst
of
Samaria.
006:021
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
Elisha,
when
he
saw
them,
My
father,
shall
I
smite
them?
shall
I
smite
them?
006:022
And
he
answered,
Thou
shalt
not
smite
them:
wouldest
thou
smite
those
whom
thou
hast
taken
captive
with
thy
sword
and
with
thy
bow?
set
bread
and
water
before
them,
that
they
may
eat
and
drink,
and
go
to
their
master.
006:023
And
he
prepared
great
provision
for
them:
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk,
he
sent
them
away,
and
they
went
to
their
master.
So
the
bands
of
Syria
came
no
more
into
the
land
of
Israel.
006:024
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
Benhadad
king
of
Syria
gathered
all
his
host,
and
went
up,
and
besieged
Samaria.
006:025
And
there
was
a
great
famine
in
Samaria:
and,
behold,
they
