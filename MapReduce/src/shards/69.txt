besieged
it,
until
an
ass's
head
was
sold
for
fourscore
pieces
of
silver,
and
the
fourth
part
of
a
cab
of
dove's
dung
for
five
pieces
of
silver.
006:026
And
as
the
king
of
Israel
was
passing
by
upon
the
wall,
there
cried
a
woman
unto
him,
saying,
Help,
my
lord,
O
king.
006:027
And
he
said,
If
the
LORD
do
not
help
thee,
whence
shall
I
help
thee?
out
of
the
barnfloor,
or
out
of
the
winepress?
006:028
And
the
king
said
unto
her,
What
aileth
thee?
And
she
answered,
This
woman
said
unto
me,
Give
thy
son,
that
we
may
eat
him
to
day,
and
we
will
eat
my
son
to
morrow.
006:029
So
we
boiled
my
son,
and
did
eat
him:
and
I
said
unto
her
on
the
next
day,
Give
thy
son,
that
we
may
eat
him:
and
she
hath
hid
her
son.
006:030
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
king
heard
the
words
of
the
woman,
that
he
rent
his
clothes;
and
he
passed
by
upon
the
wall,
and
the
people
looked,
and,
behold,
he
had
sackcloth
within
upon
his
flesh.
006:031
Then
he
said,
God
do
so
and
more
also
to
me,
if
the
head
of
Elisha
the
son
of
Shaphat
shall
stand
on
him
this
day.
006:032
But
Elisha
sat
in
his
house,
and
the
elders
sat
with
him;
and
the
king
sent
a
man
from
before
him:
but
ere
the
messenger
came
to
him,
he
said
to
the
elders,
See
ye
how
this
son
of
a
murderer
hath
sent
to
take
away
mine
head?
look,
when
the
messenger
cometh,
shut
the
door,
and
hold
him
fast
at
the
door:
is
not
the
sound
of
his
master's
feet
behind
him?
006:033
And
while
he
yet
talked
with
them,
behold,
the
messenger
came
down
unto
him:
and
he
said,
Behold,
this
evil
is
of
the
LORD;
what
should
I
wait
for
the
LORD
any
longer?
007:001
Then
Elisha
said,
Hear
ye
the
word
of
the
LORD;
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
To
morrow
about
this
time
shall
a
measure
of
fine
flour
be
sold
for
a
shekel,
and
two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel,
in
the
gate
of
Samaria.
007:002
Then
a
lord
on
whose
hand
the
king
leaned
answered
the
man
of
God,
and
said,
Behold,
if
the
LORD
would
make
windows
in
heaven,
might
this
thing
be?
And
he
said,
Behold,
thou
shalt
see
it
with
thine
eyes,
but
shalt
not
eat
thereof.
007:003
And
there
were
four
leprous
men
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate:
and
they
said
one
to
another,
Why
sit
we
here
until
we
die?
007:004
If
we
say,
We
will
enter
into
the
city,
then
the
famine
is
in
the
city,
and
we
shall
die
there:
and
if
we
sit
still
here,
we
die
also.
Now
therefore
come,
and
let
us
fall
unto
the
host
of
the
Syrians:
if
they
save
us
alive,
we
shall
live;
and
if
they
kill
us,
we
shall
but
die.
007:005
And
they
rose
up
in
the
twilight,
to
go
unto
the
camp
of
the
Syrians:
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
camp
of
Syria,
behold,
there
was
no
man
there.
007:006
For
the
LORD
had
made
the
host
of
the
Syrians
to
hear
a
noise
of
chariots,
and
a
noise
of
horses,
even
the
noise
of
a
great
host:
and
they
said
one
to
another,
Lo,
the
king
of
Israel
hath
hired
against
us
the
kings
of
the
Hittites,
and
the
kings
of
the
Egyptians,
to
come
upon
us.
007:007
Wherefore
they
arose
and
fled
in
the
twilight,
and
left
their
tents,
and
their
horses,
and
their
asses,
even
the
camp
as
it
was,
and
fled
for
their
life.
007:008
And
when
these
lepers
came
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
camp,
they
went
into
one
tent,
and
did
eat
and
drink,
and
carried
thence
silver,
and
gold,
and
raiment,
and
went
and
hid
it;
and
came
again,
and
entered
into
another
tent,
and
carried
thence
also,
and
went
and
hid
it.
007:009
Then
they
said
one
to
another,
We
do
not
well:
this
day
is
a
day
of
good
tidings,
and
we
hold
our
peace:
if
we
tarry
till
the
morning
light,
some
mischief
will
come
upon
us:
now
therefore
come,
that
we
may
go
and
tell
the
king's
household.
007:010
So
they
came
and
called
unto
the
porter
of
the
city:
and
they
told
them,
saying,
We
came
to
the
camp
of
the
Syrians,
and,
behold,
there
was
no
man
there,
neither
voice
of
man,
but
horses
tied,
and
asses
tied,
and
the
tents
as
they
were.
007:011
And
he
called
the
porters;
and
they
told
it
to
the
king's
house
within.
007:012
And
the
king
arose
in
the
night,
and
said
unto
his
servants,
I
will
now
shew
you
what
the
Syrians
have
done
to
us.
They
know
that
we
be
hungry;
therefore
are
they
gone
out
of
the
camp
to
hide
themselves
in
the
field,
saying,
When
they
come
out
of
the
city,
we
shall
catch
them
alive,
and
get
into
the
city.
007:013
And
one
of
his
servants
answered
and
said,
Let
some
take,
I
pray
thee,
five
of
the
horses
that
remain,
which
are
left
in
the
city,
(behold,
they
are
as
all
the
multitude
of
Israel
that
are
left
in
it:
behold,
I
say,
they
are
even
as
all
the
multitude
of
the
Israelites
that
are
consumed:)
and
let
us
send
and
see.
007:014
They
took
therefore
two
chariot
horses;
and
the
king
sent
after
the
host
of
the
Syrians,
saying,
Go
and
see.
007:015
And
they
went
after
them
unto
Jordan:
and,
lo,
all
the
way
was
full
of
garments
and
vessels,
which
the
Syrians
had
cast
away
in
their
haste.
And
the
messengers
returned,
and
told
the
king.
007:016
And
the
people
went
out,
and
spoiled
the
tents
of
the
Syrians.
So
a
measure
of
fine
flour
was
sold
for
a
shekel,
and
two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD.
007:017
And
the
king
appointed
the
lord
on
whose
hand
he
leaned
to
have
the
charge
of
the
gate:
and
the
people
trode
upon
him
in
the
gate,
and
he
died,
as
the
man
of
God
had
said,
who
spake
when
the
king
came
down
to
him.
007:018
And
it
came
to
pass
as
the
man
of
God
had
spoken
to
the
king,
saying,
Two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel,
and
a
measure
of
fine
flour
for
a
shekel,
shall
be
to
morrow
about
this
time
in
the
gate
of
Samaria:
007:019
And
that
lord
answered
the
man
of
God,
and
said,
Now,
behold,
if
the
LORD
should
make
windows
in
heaven,
might
such
a
thing
be?
And
he
said,
Behold,
thou
shalt
see
it
with
thine
eyes,
but
shalt
not
eat
thereof.
007:020
And
so
it
fell
out
unto
him:
for
the
people
trode
upon
him
in
the
gate,
and
he
died.
008:001
Then
spake
Elisha
unto
the
woman,
whose
son
he
had
restored
to
life,
saying,
Arise,
and
go
thou
and
thine
household,
and
sojourn
wheresoever
thou
canst
sojourn:
for
the
LORD
hath
called
for
a
famine;
and
it
shall
also
come
upon
the
land
seven
years.
008:002
And
the
woman
arose,
and
did
after
the
saying
of
the
man
of
God:
and
she
went
with
her
household,
and
sojourned
in
the
land
of
the
Philistines
seven
years.
008:003
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seven
years'
end,
that
the
woman
returned
out
of
the
land
of
the
Philistines:
and
she
went
forth
to
cry
unto
the
king
for
her
house
and
for
her
land.
008:004
And
the
king
talked
with
Gehazi
the
servant
of
the
man
of
God,
saying,
Tell
me,
I
pray
thee,
all
the
great
things
that
Elisha
hath
done.
008:005
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
was
telling
the
king
how
he
had
restored
a
dead
body
to
life,
that,
behold,
the
woman,
whose
son
he
had
restored
to
life,
cried
to
the
king
for
her
house
and
for
her
land.
And
Gehazi
said,
My
lord,
O
king,
this
is
the
woman,
and
this
is
her
son,
whom
Elisha
restored
to
life.
008:006
And
when
the
king
asked
the
woman,
she
told
him.
So
the
king
appointed
unto
her
a
certain
officer,
saying,
Restore
all
that
was
hers,
and
all
the
fruits
of
the
field
since
the
day
that
she
left
the
land,
even
until
now.
008:007
And
Elisha
came
to
Damascus;
and
Benhadad
the
king
of
Syria
was
sick;
and
it
was
told
him,
saying,
The
man
of
God
is
come
hither.
008:008
And
the
king
said
unto
Hazael,
Take
a
present
in
thine
hand,
and
go,
meet
the
man
of
God,
and
enquire
of
the
LORD
by
him,
saying,
Shall
I
recover
of
this
disease?
008:009
So
Hazael
went
to
meet
him,
and
took
a
present
with
him,
even
of
every
good
thing
of
Damascus,
forty
camels'
burden,
and
came
and
stood
before
him,
and
said,
Thy
son
Benhadad
king
of
Syria
hath
sent
me
to
thee,
saying,
Shall
I
recover
of
this
disease?
008:010
And
Elisha
said
unto
him,
Go,
say
unto
him,
Thou
mayest
certainly
recover:
howbeit
the
LORD
hath
shewed
me
that
he
shall
surely
die.
008:011
And
he
settled
his
countenance
stedfastly,
until
he
was
ashamed:
and
the
man
of
God
wept.
008:012
And
Hazael
said,
Why
weepeth
my
lord?
And
he
answered,
Because
I
know
the
evil
that
thou
wilt
do
unto
the
children
of
Israel:
their
strong
holds
wilt
thou
set
on
fire,
and
their
young
men
wilt
thou
slay
with
the
sword,
and
wilt
dash
their
children,
and
rip
up
their
women
with
child.
008:013
And
Hazael
said,
But
what,
is
thy
servant
a
dog,
that
he
should
do
this
great
thing?
And
Elisha
answered,
The
LORD
hath
shewed
me
that
thou
shalt
be
king
over
Syria.
008:014
So
he
departed
from
Elisha,
and
came
to
his
master;
who
said
to
him,
What
said
Elisha
to
thee?
And
he
answered,
He
told
me
that
thou
shouldest
surely
recover.
008:015
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
that
he
took
a
thick
cloth,
and
dipped
it
in
water,
and
spread
it
on
his
face,
so
that
he
died:
and
Hazael
reigned
in
his
stead.
008:016
And
in
the
fifth
year
of
Joram
the
son
of
Ahab
king
of
Israel,
Jehoshaphat
being
then
king
of
Judah,
Jehoram
the
son
of
Je
hoshaphat
king
of
Judah
began
to
reign.
008:017
Thirty
and
two
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign;
and
he
reigned
eight
years
in
Jerusalem.
008:018
And
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
Israel,
as
did
the
house
of
Ahab:
for
the
daughter
of
Ahab
was
his
wife:
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD.
008:019
Yet
the
LORD
would
not
destroy
Judah
for
David
his
servant's
sake,
as
he
promised
him
to
give
him
alway
a
light,
and
to
his
children.
008:020
In
his
days
Edom
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
Judah,
and
made
a
king
over
themselves.
008:021
So
Joram
went
over
to
Zair,
and
all
the
chariots
with
him:
and
he
rose
by
night,
and
smote
the
Edomites
which
compassed
him
about,
and
the
captains
of
the
chariots:
and
the
people
fled
into
their
tents.
008:022
Yet
Edom
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
Judah
unto
this
day.
Then
Libnah
revolted
at
the
same
time.
008:023
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Joram,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
008:024
And
Joram
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David:
and
Ahaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
008:025
In
the
twelfth
year
of
Joram
the
son
of
Ahab
king
of
Israel
did
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Jehoram
king
of
Judah
begin
to
reign.
008:026
Two
and
twenty
years
old
was
Ahaziah
when
he
began
to
reign;
and
he
reigned
one
year
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Athaliah,
the
daughter
of
Omri
king
of
Israel.
008:027
And
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
house
of
Ahab,
and
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
as
did
the
house
of
Ahab:
for
he
was
the
son
in
law
of
the
house
of
Ahab.
008:028
And
he
went
with
Joram
the
son
of
Ahab
to
the
war
against
Hazael
king
of
Syria
in
Ramothgilead;
and
the
Syrians
wounded
Joram.
008:029
And
king
Joram
went
back
to
be
healed
in
Jezreel
of
the
wounds
which
the
Syrians
had
given
him
at
Ramah,
when
he
fought
against
Hazael
king
of
Syria.
And
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Jehoram
king
of
Judah
went
down
to
see
Joram
the
son
of
Ahab
in
Jezreel,
because
he
was
sick.
009:001
And
Elisha
the
prophet
called
one
of
the
children
of
the
prophets,
and
said
unto
him,
Gird
up
thy
loins,
and
take
this
box
of
oil
in
thine
hand,
and
go
to
Ramothgilead:
009:002
And
when
thou
comest
thither,
look
out
there
Jehu
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Nimshi,
and
go
in,
and
make
him
arise
up
from
among
his
brethren,
and
carry
him
to
an
inner
chamber;
009:003
Then
take
the
box
of
oil,
and
pour
it
on
his
head,
and
say,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
I
have
anointed
thee
king
over
Israel.
Then
open
the
door,
and
flee,
and
tarry
not.
009:004
So
the
young
man,
even
the
young
man
the
prophet,
went
to
Ramothgilead.
009:005
And
when
he
came,
behold,
the
captains
of
the
host
were
sitting;
and
he
said,
I
have
an
errand
to
thee,
O
captain.
And
Jehu
said,
Unto
which
of
all
us?
And
he
said,
To
thee,
O
captain.
009:006
And
he
arose,
and
went
into
the
house;
and
he
poured
the
oil
on
his
head,
and
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
I
have
anointed
thee
king
over
the
people
of
the
LORD,
even
over
Israel.
009:007
And
thou
shalt
smite
the
house
of
Ahab
thy
master,
that
I
may
avenge
the
blood
of
my
servants
the
prophets,
and
the
blood
of
all
the
servants
of
the
LORD,
at
the
hand
of
Jezebel.
009:008
For
the
whole
house
of
Ahab
shall
perish:
and
I
will
cut
off
from
Ahab
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall,
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
Israel:
009:009
And
I
will
make
the
house
of
Ahab
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
and
like
the
house
of
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah:
009:010
And
the
dogs
shall
eat
Jezebel
in
the
portion
of
Jezreel,
and
there
shall
be
none
to
bury
her.
And
he
opened
the
door,
and
fled.
009:011
Then
Jehu
came
forth
to
the
servants
of
his
lord:
and
one
said
unto
him,
Is
all
well?
wherefore
came
this
mad
fellow
to
thee?
And
he
said
unto
them,
Ye
know
the
man,
and
his
communication.
009:012
And
they
said,
It
is
false;
tell
us
now.
And
he
said,
Thus
and
thus
spake
he
to
me,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
I
have
anointed
thee
king
over
Israel.
009:013
Then
they
hasted,
and
took
every
man
his
garment,
and
put
it
under
him
on
the
top
of
the
stairs,
and
blew
with
trumpets,
saying,
Jehu
is
king.
009:014
So
Jehu
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Nimshi
conspired
against
Joram.
(Now
Joram
had
kept
Ramothgilead,
he
and
all
Israel,
because
of
Hazael
king
of
Syria.
009:015
But
king
Joram
was
returned
to
be
healed
in
Jezreel
of
the
wounds
which
the
Syrians
had
given
him,
when
he
fought
with
Hazael
king
of
Syria.)
And
Jehu
said,
If
it
be
your
minds,
then
let
none
go
forth
nor
escape
out
of
the
city
to
go
to
tell
it
in
Jezreel.
009:016
So
Jehu
rode
in
a
chariot,
and
went
to
Jezreel;
for
Joram
lay
there.
And
Ahaziah
king
of
Judah
was
come
down
to
see
Joram.
009:017
And
there
stood
a
watchman
on
the
tower
in
Jezreel,
and
he
spied
the
company
of
Jehu
as
he
came,
and
said,
I
see
a
company.
And
Joram
said,
Take
an
horseman,
and
send
to
meet
them,
and
let
him
say,
Is
it
peace?
009:018
So
there
went
one
on
horseback
to
meet
him,
and
said,
Thus
saith
the
king,
Is
it
peace?
And
Jehu
said,
What
hast
thou
to
do
with
peace?
turn
thee
behind
me.
And
the
watchman
told,
saying,
The
messenger
came
to
them,
but
he
cometh
not
again.
009:019
Then
he
sent
out
a
second
on
horseback,
which
came
to
them,
and
said,
Thus
saith
the
king,
Is
it
peace?
And
Jehu
answered,
What
hast
thou
to
do
with
peace?
turn
thee
behind
me.
009:020
And
the
watchman
told,
saying,
He
came
even
unto
them,
and
cometh
not
again:
and
the
driving
is
like
the
driving
of
Jehu
the
son
of
Nimshi;
for
he
driveth
furiously.
009:021
And
Joram
said,
Make
ready.
And
his
chariot
was
made
ready.
And
Joram
king
of
Israel
and
Ahaziah
king
of
Judah
went
out,
each
in
his
chariot,
and
they
went
out
against
Jehu,
and
met
him
in
the
portion
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite.
009:022
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Joram
saw
Jehu,
that
he
said,
Is
it
peace,
Jehu?
And
he
answered,
What
peace,
so
long
as
the
whoredoms
of
thy
mother
Jezebel
and
her
witchcrafts
are
so
many?
009:023
And
Joram
turned
his
hands,
and
fled,
and
said
to
Ahaziah,
There
is
treachery,
O
Ahaziah.
009:024
And
Jehu
drew
a
bow
with
his
full
strength,
and
smote
Jehoram
between
his
arms,
and
the
arrow
went
out
at
his
heart,
and
he
sunk
down
in
his
chariot.
009:025
Then
said
Jehu
to
Bidkar
his
captain,
Take
up,
and
cast
him
in
the
portion
of
the
field
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite:
for
remember
how
that,
when
I
and
thou
rode
together
after
Ahab
his
father,
the
LORD
laid
this
burden
upon
him;
009:026
Surely
I
have
seen
yesterday
the
blood
of
Naboth,
and
the
blood
of
his
sons,
saith
the
LORD;
and
I
will
requite
thee
in
this
plat,
saith
the
LORD.
Now
therefore
take
and
cast
him
into
the
plat
of
ground,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD.
009:027
But
when
Ahaziah
the
king
of
Judah
saw
this,
he
fled
by
the
way
of
the
garden
house.
And
Jehu
followed
after
him,
and
said,
Smite
him
also
in
the
chariot.
And
they
did
so
at
the
going
up
to
Gur,
which
is
by
Ibleam.
And
he
fled
to
Megiddo,
and
died
there.
009:028
And
his
servants
carried
him
in
a
chariot
to
Jerusalem,
and
buried
him
in
his
sepulchre
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David.
009:029
And
in
the
eleventh
year
of
Joram
the
son
of
Ahab
began
Ahaziah
to
reign
over
Judah.
009:030
And
when
Jehu
was
come
to
Jezreel,
Jezebel
heard
of
it;
and
she
painted
her
face,
and
tired
her
head,
and
looked
out
at
a
window.
009:031
And
as
Jehu
entered
in
at
the
gate,
she
said,
Had
Zimri
peace,
who
slew
his
master?
009:032
And
he
lifted
up
his
face
to
the
window,
and
said,
Who
is
on
my
side?
who?
And
there
looked
out
to
him
two
or
three
eunuchs.
009:033
And
he
said,
Throw
her
down.
So
they
threw
her
down:
and
some
of
her
blood
was
sprinkled
on
the
wall,
and
on
the
horses:
and
he
trode
her
under
foot.
009:034
And
when
he
was
come
in,
he
did
eat
and
drink,
and
said,
Go,
see
now
this
cursed
woman,
and
bury
her:
for
she
is
a
king's
daughter.
009:035
And
they
went
to
bury
her:
but
they
found
no
more
of
her
than
the
skull,
and
the
feet,
and
the
palms
of
her
hands.
009:036
Wherefore
they
came
again,
and
told
him.
And
he
said,
This
is
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
Elijah
the
Tishbite,
saying,
In
the
portion
of
Jezreel
shall
dogs
eat
the
flesh
of
Jezebel:
009:037
And
the
carcase
of
Jezebel
shall
be
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
field
in
the
portion
of
Jezreel;
so
that
they
shall
not
say,
This
is
Jezebel.
010:001
And
Ahab
had
seventy
sons
in
Samaria.
And
Jehu
wrote
letters,
and
sent
to
Samaria,
unto
the
rulers
of
Jezreel,
to
the
elders,
and
to
them
that
brought
up
Ahab's
children,
saying,
010:002
Now
as
soon
as
this
letter
cometh
to
you,
seeing
your
master's
sons
are
with
you,
and
there
are
with
you
chariots
and
horses,
a
fenced
city
also,
and
armour;
010:003
Look
even
out
the
best
and
meetest
of
your
master's
sons,
and
set
him
on
his
father's
throne,
and
fight
for
your
master's
house.
010:004
But
they
were
exceedingly
afraid,
and
said,
Behold,
two
kings
stood
not
before
him:
how
then
shall
we
stand?
010:005
And
he
that
was
over
the
house,
and
he
that
was
over
the
city,
the
elders
also,
and
the
bringers
up
of
the
children,
sent
to
Jehu,
saying,
We
are
thy
servants,
and
will
do
all
that
thou
shalt
bid
us;
we
will
not
make
any
king:
do
thou
that
which
is
good
in
thine
eyes.
010:006
Then
he
wrote
a
letter
the
second
time
to
them,
saying,
If
ye
be
mine,
and
if
ye
will
hearken
unto
my
voice,
take
ye
the
heads
of
the
men
your
master's
sons,
and
come
to
me
to
Jezreel
by
to
morrow
this
time.
Now
the
king's
sons,
being
seventy
persons,
were
with
the
great
men
of
the
city,
which
brought
them
up.
010:007
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
letter
came
to
them,
that
they
took
the
king's
sons,
and
slew
seventy
persons,
and
put
their
heads
in
baskets,
and
sent
him
them
to
Jezreel.
010:008
And
there
came
a
messenger,
and
told
him,
saying,
They
have
brought
the
heads
of
the
king's
sons.
And
he
said,
Lay
ye
them
in
two
heaps
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
until
the
morning.
010:009
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning,
that
he
went
out,
and
stood,
and
said
to
all
the
people,
Ye
be
righteous:
behold,
I
conspired
against
my
master,
and
slew
him:
but
who
slew
all
these?
010:010
Know
now
that
there
shall
fall
unto
the
earth
nothing
of
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
the
LORD
spake
concerning
the
house
of
Ahab:
for
the
LORD
hath
done
that
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
Elijah.
010:011
So
Jehu
slew
all
that
remained
of
the
house
of
Ahab
in
Jezreel,
and
all
his
great
men,
and
his
kinsfolks,
and
his
priests,
until
he
left
him
none
remaining.
010:012
And
he
arose
and
departed,
and
came
to
Samaria.
And
as
he
was
at
the
shearing
house
in
the
way,
010:013
Jehu
met
with
the
brethren
of
Ahaziah
king
of
Judah,
and
said,
Who
are
ye?
And
they
answered,
We
are
the
brethren
of
Ahaziah;
and
we
go
down
to
salute
the
children
of
the
king
and
the
children
of
the
queen.
010:014
And
he
said,
Take
them
alive.
And
they
took
them
alive,
and
slew
them
at
the
pit
of
the
shearing
house,
even
two
and
forty
men;
neither
left
he
any
of
them.
010:015
And
when
he
was
departed
thence,
he
lighted
on
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
coming
to
meet
him:
and
he
saluted
him,
and
said
to
him,
Is
thine
heart
right,
as
my
heart
is
with
thy
heart?
And
Jehonadab
answered,
It
is.
If
it
be,
give
me
thine
hand.
And
he
gave
him
his
hand;
and
he
took
him
up
to
him
into
the
chariot.
010:016
And
he
said,
Come
with
me,
and
see
my
zeal
for
the
LORD.
So
they
made
him
ride
in
his
chariot.
010:017
And
when
he
came
to
Samaria,
he
slew
all
that
remained
unto
Ahab
in
Samaria,
till
he
had
destroyed
him,
according
to
the
saying
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
to
Elijah.
010:018
And
Jehu
gathered
all
the
people
together,
and
said
unto
them,
Ahab
served
Baal
a
little;
but
Jehu
shall
serve
him
much.
010:019
Now
therefore
call
unto
me
all
the
prophets
of
Baal,
all
his
servants,
and
all
his
priests;
let
none
be
wanting:
for
I
have
a
great
sacrifice
to
do
to
Baal;
whosoever
shall
be
wanting,
he
shall
not
live.
But
Jehu
did
it
in
subtilty,
to
the
intent
that
he
might
destroy
the
worshippers
