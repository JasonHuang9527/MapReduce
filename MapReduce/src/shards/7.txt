037:033
And
he
knew
it,
and
said,
It
is
my
son's
coat;
an
evil
beast
hath
devoured
him;
Joseph
is
without
doubt
rent
in
pieces.
037:034
And
Jacob
rent
his
clothes,
and
put
sackcloth
upon
his
loins,
and
mourned
for
his
son
many
days.
037:035
And
all
his
sons
and
all
his
daughters
rose
up
to
comfort
him;
but
he
refused
to
be
comforted;
and
he
said,
For
I
will
go
down
into
the
grave
unto
my
son
mourning.
Thus
his
father
wept
for
him.
037:036
And
the
Midianites
sold
him
into
Egypt
unto
Potiphar,
an
officer
of
Pharaoh's,
and
captain
of
the
guard.
038:001
And
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time,
that
Judah
went
down
from
his
brethren,
and
turned
in
to
a
certain
Adullamite,
whose
name
was
Hirah.
038:002
And
Judah
saw
there
a
daughter
of
a
certain
Canaanite,
whose
name
was
Shuah;
and
he
took
her,
and
went
in
unto
her.
038:003
And
she
conceived,
and
bare
a
son;
and
he
called
his
name
Er.
038:004
And
she
conceived
again,
and
bare
a
son;
and
she
called
his
name
Onan.
038:005
And
she
yet
again
conceived,
and
bare
a
son;
and
called
his
name
Shelah:
and
he
was
at
Chezib,
when
she
bare
him.
038:006
And
Judah
took
a
wife
for
Er
his
firstborn,
whose
name
was
Tamar.
038:007
And
Er,
Judah's
firstborn,
was
wicked
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD;
and
the
LORD
slew
him.
038:008
And
Judah
said
unto
Onan,
Go
in
unto
thy
brother's
wife,
and
marry
her,
and
raise
up
seed
to
thy
brother.
038:009
And
Onan
knew
that
the
seed
should
not
be
his;
and
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
went
in
unto
his
brother's
wife,
that
he
spilled
it
on
the
ground,
lest
that
he
should
give
seed
to
his
brother.
038:010
And
the
thing
which
he
did
displeased
the
LORD:
wherefore
he
slew
him
also.
038:011
Then
said
Judah
to
Tamar
his
daughter
in
law,
Remain
a
widow
at
thy
father's
house,
till
Shelah
my
son
be
grown:
for
he
said,
Lest
peradventure
he
die
also,
as
his
brethren
did.
And
Tamar
went
and
dwelt
in
her
father's
house.
038:012
And
in
process
of
time
the
daughter
of
Shuah
Judah's
wife
died;
and
Judah
was
comforted,
and
went
up
unto
his
sheepshearers
to
Timnath,
he
and
his
friend
Hirah
the
Adullamite.
038:013
And
it
was
told
Tamar,
saying,
Behold
thy
father
in
law
goeth
up
to
Timnath
to
shear
his
sheep.
038:014
And
she
put
her
widow's
garments
off
from
her,
and
covered
her
with
a
vail,
and
wrapped
herself,
and
sat
in
an
open
place,
which
is
by
the
way
to
Timnath;
for
she
saw
that
Shelah
was
grown,
and
she
was
not
given
unto
him
to
wife.
038:015
When
Judah
saw
her,
he
thought
her
to
be
an
harlot;
because
she
had
covered
her
face.
038:016
And
he
turned
unto
her
by
the
way,
and
said,
Go
to,
I
pray
thee,
let
me
come
in
unto
thee;
(for
he
knew
not
that
she
was
his
daughter
in
law.)
And
she
said,
What
wilt
thou
give
me,
that
thou
mayest
come
in
unto
me?
038:017
And
he
said,
I
will
send
thee
a
kid
from
the
flock.
And
she
said,
Wilt
thou
give
me
a
pledge,
till
thou
send
it?
038:018
And
he
said,
What
pledge
shall
I
give
thee?
And
she
said,
Thy
signet,
and
thy
bracelets,
and
thy
staff
that
is
in
thine
hand.
And
he
gave
it
her,
and
came
in
unto
her,
and
she
conceived
by
him.
038:019
And
she
arose,
and
went
away,
and
laid
by
her
vail
from
her,
and
put
on
the
garments
of
her
widowhood.
038:020
And
Judah
sent
the
kid
by
the
hand
of
his
friend
the
Adullamite,
to
receive
his
pledge
from
the
woman's
hand:
but
he
found
her
not.
038:021
Then
he
asked
the
men
of
that
place,
saying,
Where
is
the
harlot,
that
was
openly
by
the
way
side?
And
they
said,
There
was
no
harlot
in
this
place.
038:022
And
he
returned
to
Judah,
and
said,
I
cannot
find
her;
and
also
the
men
of
the
place
said,
that
there
was
no
harlot
in
this
place.
038:023
And
Judah
said,
Let
her
take
it
to
her,
lest
we
be
shamed:
behold,
I
sent
this
kid,
and
thou
hast
not
found
her.
038:024
And
it
came
to
pass
about
three
months
after,
that
it
was
told
Judah,
saying,
Tamar
thy
daughter
in
law
hath
played
the
harlot;
and
also,
behold,
she
is
with
child
by
whoredom.
And
Judah
said,
Bring
her
forth,
and
let
her
be
burnt.
038:025
When
she
was
brought
forth,
she
sent
to
her
father
in
law,
saying,
By
the
man,
whose
these
are,
am
I
with
child:
and
she
said,
Discern,
I
pray
thee,
whose
are
these,
the
signet,
and
bracelets,
and
staff.
038:026
And
Judah
acknowledged
them,
and
said,
She
hath
been
more
righteous
than
I;
because
that
I
gave
her
not
to
Shelah
my
son.
And
he
knew
her
again
no
more.
038:027
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
time
of
her
travail,
that,
behold,
twins
were
in
her
womb.
038:028
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
she
travailed,
that
the
one
put
out
his
hand:
and
the
midwife
took
and
bound
upon
his
hand
a
scarlet
thread,
saying,
This
came
out
first.
038:029
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
drew
back
his
hand,
that,
behold,
his
brother
came
out:
and
she
said,
How
hast
thou
broken
forth?
this
breach
be
upon
thee:
therefore
his
name
was
called
Pharez.
038:030
And
afterward
came
out
his
brother,
that
had
the
scarlet
thread
upon
his
hand:
and
his
name
was
called
Zarah.
039:001
And
Joseph
was
brought
down
to
Egypt;
and
Potiphar,
an
officer
of
Pharaoh,
captain
of
the
guard,
an
Egyptian,
bought
him
of
the
hands
of
the
Ishmeelites,
which
had
brought
him
down
thither.
039:002
And
the
LORD
was
with
Joseph,
and
he
was
a
prosperous
man;
and
he
was
in
the
house
of
his
master
the
Egyptian.
039:003
And
his
master
saw
that
the
LORD
was
with
him,
and
that
the
LORD
made
all
that
he
did
to
prosper
in
his
hand.
039:004
And
Joseph
found
grace
in
his
sight,
and
he
served
him:
and
he
made
him
overseer
over
his
house,
and
all
that
he
had
he
put
into
his
hand.
039:005
And
it
came
to
pass
from
the
time
that
he
had
made
him
overseer
in
his
house,
and
over
all
that
he
had,
that
the
LORD
blessed
the
Egyptian's
house
for
Joseph's
sake;
and
the
blessing
of
the
LORD
was
upon
all
that
he
had
in
the
house,
and
in
the
field.
039:006
And
he
left
all
that
he
had
in
Joseph's
hand;
and
he
knew
not
ought
he
had,
save
the
bread
which
he
did
eat.
And
Joseph
was
a
goodly
person,
and
well
favoured.
039:007
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things,
that
his
master's
wife
cast
her
eyes
upon
Joseph;
and
she
said,
Lie
with
me.
039:008
But
he
refused,
and
said
unto
his
master's
wife,
Behold,
my
master
wotteth
not
what
is
with
me
in
the
house,
and
he
hath
committed
all
that
he
hath
to
my
hand;
039:009
There
is
none
greater
in
this
house
than
I;
neither
hath
he
kept
back
any
thing
from
me
but
thee,
because
thou
art
his
wife:
how
then
can
I
do
this
great
wickedness,
and
sin
against
God?
039:010
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
she
spake
to
Joseph
day
by
day,
that
he
hearkened
not
unto
her,
to
lie
by
her,
or
to
be
with
her.
039:011
And
it
came
to
pass
about
this
time,
that
Joseph
went
into
the
house
to
do
his
business;
and
there
was
none
of
the
men
of
the
house
there
within.
039:012
And
she
caught
him
by
his
garment,
saying,
Lie
with
me:
and
he
left
his
garment
in
her
hand,
and
fled,
and
got
him
out.
039:013
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
she
saw
that
he
had
left
his
garment
in
her
hand,
and
was
fled
forth,
039:014
That
she
called
unto
the
men
of
her
house,
and
spake
unto
them,
saying,
See,
he
hath
brought
in
an
Hebrew
unto
us
to
mock
us;
he
came
in
unto
me
to
lie
with
me,
and
I
cried
with
a
loud
voice:
039:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
he
heard
that
I
lifted
up
my
voice
and
cried,
that
he
left
his
garment
with
me,
and
fled,
and
got
him
out.
039:016
And
she
laid
up
his
garment
by
her,
until
his
lord
came
home.
039:017
And
she
spake
unto
him
according
to
these
words,
saying,
The
Hebrew
servant,
which
thou
hast
brought
unto
us,
came
in
unto
me
to
mock
me:
039:018
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
I
lifted
up
my
voice
and
cried,
that
he
left
his
garment
with
me,
and
fled
out.
039:019
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
his
master
heard
the
words
of
his
wife,
which
she
spake
unto
him,
saying,
After
this
manner
did
thy
servant
to
me;
that
his
wrath
was
kindled.
039:020
And
Joseph's
master
took
him,
and
put
him
into
the
prison,
a
place
where
the
king's
prisoners
were
bound:
and
he
was
there
in
the
prison.
039:021
But
the
LORD
was
with
Joseph,
and
shewed
him
mercy,
and
gave
him
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
keeper
of
the
prison.
039:022
And
the
keeper
of
the
prison
committed
to
Joseph's
hand
all
the
prisoners
that
were
in
the
prison;
and
whatsoever
they
did
there,
he
was
the
doer
of
it.
039:023
The
keeper
of
the
prison
looked
not
to
any
thing
that
was
under
his
hand;
because
the
LORD
was
with
him,
and
that
which
he
did,
the
LORD
made
it
to
prosper.
040:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things,
that
the
butler
of
the
king
of
Egypt
and
his
baker
had
offended
their
lord
the
king
of
Egypt.
040:002
And
Pharaoh
was
wroth
against
two
of
his
officers,
against
the
chief
of
the
butlers,
and
against
the
chief
of
the
bakers.
040:003
And
he
put
them
in
ward
in
the
house
of
the
captain
of
the
guard,
into
the
prison,
the
place
where
Joseph
was
bound.
040:004
And
the
captain
of
the
guard
charged
Joseph
with
them,
and
he
served
them:
and
they
continued
a
season
in
ward.
040:005
And
they
dreamed
a
dream
both
of
them,
each
man
his
dream
in
one
night,
each
man
according
to
the
interpretation
of
his
dream,
the
butler
and
the
baker
of
the
king
of
Egypt,
which
were
bound
in
the
prison.
040:006
And
Joseph
came
in
unto
them
in
the
morning,
and
looked
upon
them,
and,
behold,
they
were
sad.
040:007
And
he
asked
Pharaoh's
officers
that
were
with
him
in
the
ward
of
his
lord's
house,
saying,
Wherefore
look
ye
so
sadly
to
day?
040:008
And
they
said
unto
him,
We
have
dreamed
a
dream,
and
there
is
no
interpreter
of
it.
And
Joseph
said
unto
them,
Do
not
interpretations
belong
to
God?
tell
me
them,
I
pray
you.
040:009
And
the
chief
butler
told
his
dream
to
Joseph,
and
said
to
him,
In
my
dream,
behold,
a
vine
was
before
me;
040:010
And
in
the
vine
were
three
branches:
and
it
was
as
though
it
budded,
and
her
blossoms
shot
forth;
and
the
clusters
thereof
brought
forth
ripe
grapes:
040:011
And
Pharaoh's
cup
was
in
my
hand:
and
I
took
the
grapes,
and
pressed
them
into
Pharaoh's
cup,
and
I
gave
the
cup
into
Pharaoh's
hand.
040:012
And
Joseph
said
unto
him,
This
is
the
interpretation
of
it:
The
three
branches
are
three
days:
040:013
Yet
within
three
days
shall
Pharaoh
lift
up
thine
head,
and
restore
thee
unto
thy
place:
and
thou
shalt
deliver
Pharaoh's
cup
into
his
hand,
after
the
former
manner
when
thou
wast
his
butler.
040:014
But
think
on
me
when
it
shall
be
well
with
thee,
and
shew
kindness,
I
pray
thee,
unto
me,
and
make
mention
of
me
unto
Pharaoh,
and
bring
me
out
of
this
house:
040:015
For
indeed
I
was
stolen
away
out
of
the
land
of
the
Hebrews:
and
here
also
have
I
done
nothing
that
they
should
put
me
into
the
dungeon.
040:016
When
the
chief
baker
saw
that
the
interpretation
was
good,
he
said
unto
Joseph,
I
also
was
in
my
dream,
and,
behold,
I
had
three
white
baskets
on
my
head:
040:017
And
in
the
uppermost
basket
there
was
of
all
manner
of
bakemeats
for
Pharaoh;
and
the
birds
did
eat
them
out
of
the
basket
upon
my
head.
040:018
And
Joseph
answered
and
said,
This
is
the
interpretation
thereof:
The
three
baskets
are
three
days:
040:019
Yet
within
three
days
shall
Pharaoh
lift
up
thy
head
from
off
thee,
and
shall
hang
thee
on
a
tree;
and
the
birds
shall
eat
thy
flesh
from
off
thee.
040:020
And
it
came
to
pass
the
third
day,
which
was
Pharaoh's
birthday,
that
he
made
a
feast
unto
all
his
servants:
and
he
lifted
up
the
head
of
the
chief
butler
and
of
the
chief
baker
among
his
servants.
040:021
And
he
restored
the
chief
butler
unto
his
butlership
again;
and
he
gave
the
cup
into
Pharaoh's
hand:
040:022
But
he
hanged
the
chief
baker:
as
Joseph
had
interpreted
to
them.
040:023
Yet
did
not
the
chief
butler
remember
Joseph,
but
forgat
him.
041:001
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
full
years,
that
Pharaoh
dreamed:
and,
behold,
he
stood
by
the
river.
041:002
And,
behold,
there
came
up
out
of
the
river
seven
well
favoured
kine
and
fatfleshed;
and
they
fed
in
a
meadow.
041:003
And,
behold,
seven
other
kine
came
up
after
them
out
of
the
river,
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed;
and
stood
by
the
other
kine
upon
the
brink
of
the
river.
041:004
And
the
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed
kine
did
eat
up
the
seven
well
favoured
and
fat
kine.
So
Pharaoh
awoke.
041:005
And
he
slept
and
dreamed
the
second
time:
and,
behold,
seven
ears
of
corn
came
up
upon
one
stalk,
rank
and
good.
041:006
And,
behold,
seven
thin
ears
and
blasted
with
the
east
wind
sprung
up
after
them.
041:007
And
the
seven
thin
ears
devoured
the
seven
rank
and
full
ears.
And
Pharaoh
awoke,
and,
behold,
it
was
a
dream.
041:008
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
his
spirit
was
troubled;
and
he
sent
and
called
for
all
the
magicians
of
Egypt,
and
all
the
wise
men
thereof:
and
Pharaoh
told
them
his
dream;
but
there
was
none
that
could
interpret
them
unto
Pharaoh.
041:009
Then
spake
the
chief
butler
unto
Pharaoh,
saying,
I
do
remember
my
faults
this
day:
041:010
Pharaoh
was
wroth
with
his
servants,
and
put
me
in
ward
in
the
captain
of
the
guard's
house,
both
me
and
the
chief
baker:
041:011
And
we
dreamed
a
dream
in
one
night,
I
and
he;
we
dreamed
each
man
according
to
the
interpretation
of
his
dream.
041:012
And
there
was
there
with
us
a
young
man,
an
Hebrew,
servant
to
the
captain
of
the
guard;
and
we
told
him,
and
he
interpreted
to
us
our
dreams;
to
each
man
according
to
his
dream
he
did
interpret.
041:013
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
interpreted
to
us,
so
it
was;
me
he
restored
unto
mine
office,
and
him
he
hanged.
041:014
Then
Pharaoh
sent
and
called
Joseph,
and
they
brought
him
hastily
out
of
the
dungeon:
and
he
shaved
himself,
and
changed
his
raiment,
and
came
in
unto
Pharaoh.
041:015
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph,
I
have
dreamed
a
dream,
and
there
is
none
that
can
interpret
it:
and
I
have
heard
say
of
thee,
that
thou
canst
understand
a
dream
to
interpret
it.
041:016
And
Joseph
answered
Pharaoh,
saying,
It
is
not
in
me:
God
shall
give
Pharaoh
an
answer
of
peace.
041:017
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph,
In
my
dream,
behold,
I
stood
upon
the
bank
of
the
river:
041:018
And,
behold,
there
came
up
out
of
the
river
seven
kine,
fatfleshed
and
well
favoured;
and
they
fed
in
a
meadow:
041:019
And,
behold,
seven
other
kine
came
up
after
them,
poor
and
very
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed,
such
as
I
never
saw
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
for
badness:
041:020
And
the
lean
and
the
ill
favoured
kine
did
eat
up
the
first
seven
fat
kine:
041:021
And
when
they
had
eaten
them
up,
it
could
not
be
known
that
they
had
eaten
them;
but
they
were
still
ill
favoured,
as
at
the
beginning.
So
I
awoke.
041:022
And
I
saw
in
my
dream,
and,
behold,
seven
ears
came
up
in
one
stalk,
full
and
good:
041:023
And,
behold,
seven
ears,
withered,
thin,
and
blasted
with
the
east
wind,
sprung
up
after
them:
041:024
And
the
thin
ears
devoured
the
seven
good
ears:
and
I
told
this
unto
the
magicians;
but
there
was
none
that
could
declare
it
to
me.
041:025
And
Joseph
said
unto
Pharaoh,
The
dream
of
Pharaoh
is
one:
God
hath
shewed
Pharaoh
what
he
is
about
to
do.
041:026
The
seven
good
kine
are
seven
years;
and
the
seven
good
ears
are
seven
years:
the
dream
is
one.
041:027
And
the
seven
thin
and
ill
favoured
kine
that
came
up
after
them
are
seven
years;
and
the
seven
empty
ears
blasted
with
the
east
wind
shall
be
seven
years
of
famine.
041:028
This
is
the
thing
which
I
have
spoken
unto
Pharaoh:
What
God
is
about
to
do
he
sheweth
unto
Pharaoh.
041:029
Behold,
there
come
seven
years
of
great
plenty
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt:
041:030
And
there
shall
arise
after
them
seven
years
of
famine;
and
all
the
plenty
shall
be
forgotten
in
the
land
of
Egypt;
and
the
famine
shall
consume
the
land;
041:031
And
the
plenty
shall
not
be
known
in
the
land
by
reason
of
that
famine
following;
for
it
shall
be
very
grievous.
041:032
And
for
that
the
dream
was
doubled
unto
Pharaoh
twice;
it
is
because
the
thing
is
established
by
God,
and
God
will
shortly
bring
it
to
pass.
041:033
Now
therefore
let
Pharaoh
look
out
a
man
discreet
and
wise,
and
set
him
over
the
land
of
Egypt.
041:034
Let
Pharaoh
do
this,
and
let
him
appoint
officers
over
the
land,
and
take
up
the
fifth
part
of
the
land
of
Egypt
in
the
seven
plenteous
years.
041:035
And
let
them
gather
all
the
food
of
those
good
years
that
come,
and
lay
up
corn
under
the
hand
of
Pharaoh,
and
let
them
keep
food
in
the
cities.
041:036
And
that
food
shall
be
for
store
to
the
land
against
the
seven
years
of
famine,
which
shall
be
in
the
land
of
Egypt;
that
the
land
perish
not
through
the
famine.
041:037
And
the
thing
was
good
in
the
eyes
of
Pharaoh,
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
his
servants.
041:038
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
his
servants,
Can
we
find
such
a
one
as
this
is,
a
man
in
whom
the
Spirit
of
God
is?
041:039
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph,
Forasmuch
as
God
hath
shewed
thee
all
this,
there
is
none
so
discreet
and
wise
as
thou
art:
041:040
Thou
shalt
be
over
my
house,
and
according
unto
thy
word
shall
all
my
people
be
ruled:
only
in
the
throne
will
I
be
greater
than
thou.
041:041
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph,
See,
I
have
set
thee
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
041:042
And
Pharaoh
took
off
his
ring
from
his
hand,
and
put
it
upon
Joseph's
hand,
and
arrayed
him
in
vestures
of
fine
linen,
and
put
a
gold
chain
about
his
neck;
041:043
And
he
made
him
to
ride
in
the
second
chariot
which
he
had;
and
they
cried
before
him,
Bow
the
knee:
and
he
made
him
ruler
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
041:044
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph,
I
am
Pharaoh,
and
without
thee
shall
no
man
lift
up
his
hand
or
foot
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
041:045
And
Pharaoh
called
Joseph's
name
Zaphnathpaaneah;
and
he
gave
him
to
wife
Asenath
the
daughter
of
Potipherah
priest
of
On.
And
Joseph
went
out
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
041:046
And
Joseph
was
thirty
years
old
when
he
stood
before
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt.
And
Joseph
went
out
from
the
presence
of
Pharaoh,
and
went
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
041:047
And
in
the
seven
plenteous
years
the
earth
brought
forth
by
handfuls.
041:048
And
he
gathered
up
all
the
food
of
the
seven
years,
which
were
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
laid
up
the
food
in
the
cities:
the
food
of
the
field,
which
was
round
about
every
city,
laid
he
up
in
the
same.
041:049
And
Joseph
gathered
corn
as
the
sand
of
the
sea,
very
much,
until
he
left
numbering;
for
it
was
without
number.
041:050
And
unto
Joseph
were
born
two
sons
before
the
years
of
famine
came,
which
Asenath
the
daughter
of
Potipherah
priest
of
On
bare
unto
him.
041:051
And
Joseph
called
the
name
of
the
firstborn
Manasseh:
For
God,
said
he,
hath
made
me
forget
all
my
toil,
and
all
my
father's
house.
041:052
And
the
name
of
the
second
called
he
Ephraim:
For
God
hath
caused
me
to
be
fruitful
in
the
land
of
my
affliction.
041:053
And
the
seven
years
of
plenteousness,
that
was
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
were
ended.
041:054
And
the
seven
years
of
dearth
began
to
come,
according
as
Joseph
had
said:
and
the
dearth
was
in
all
lands;
but
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
there
was
bread.
041:055
And
when
all
the
land
of
Egypt
was
famished,
the
people
cried
to
Pharaoh
for
bread:
and
Pharaoh
said
unto
all
the
Egyptians,
Go
unto
Joseph;
what
he
saith
to
you,
do.
041:056
And
the
famine
was
over
all
the
face
of
the
earth:
and
Joseph
opened
all
the
storehouses,
and
sold
unto
the
Egyptians;
and
the
famine
waxed
sore
in
the
land
of
Egypt.
041:057
And
all
countries
came
into
Egypt
to
Joseph
for
to
buy
corn;
because
that
the
famine
was
so
sore
in
all
lands.
042:001
Now
when
Jacob
saw
that
there
was
corn
in
Egypt,
Jacob
said
unto
his
sons,
Why
do
ye
look
one
upon
another?
042:002
And
he
said,
Behold,
I
have
heard
that
there
is
corn
in
Egypt:
get
you
down
thither,
and
buy
for
us
from
thence;
that
we
may
live,
and
not
die.
042:003
And
Joseph's
ten
brethren
went
down
to
buy
corn
in
Egypt.
042:004
But
Benjamin,
Joseph's
brother,
Jacob
sent
not
with
his
brethren;
for
he
said,
Lest
peradventure
mischief
befall
him.
042:005
And
the
sons
of
Israel
came
to
buy
corn
among
those
that
came:
for
the
famine
was
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
042:006
And
Joseph
was
the
governor
over
the
land,
and
he
it
was
that
sold
to
all
the
people
of
the
land:
and
Joseph's
brethren
came,
and
bowed
down
themselves
before
him
with
their
faces
to
the
earth.
042:007
And
Joseph
saw
his
brethren,
and
he
knew
them,
but
made
himself
strange
unto
them,
and
spake
roughly
unto
them;
and
he
said
unto
them,
Whence
come
ye?
And
they
said,
From
the
land
of
Canaan
to
buy
food.
042:008
And
Joseph
knew
his
brethren,
but
they
knew
not
him.
042:009
And
Joseph
remembered
the
dreams
which
he
dreamed
of
them,
and
said
unto
them,
Ye
are
spies;
to
see
the
nakedness
of
the
land
ye
are
come.
042:010
And
they
said
unto
him,
Nay,
my
lord,
but
to
buy
food
are
thy
servants
come.
042:011
We
are
all
one
man's
sons;
we
are
true
men,
thy
servants
are
no
spies.
042:012
And
he
said
unto
them,
Nay,
but
to
see
the
nakedness
of
the
land
ye
are
come.
042:013
And
they
said,
Thy
servants
are
twelve
brethren,
the
sons
of
one
man
in
the
land
of
Canaan;
and,
behold,
the
youngest
is
this
day
with
our
father,
and
one
is
not.
042:014
And
Joseph
said
unto
them,
That
is
it
that
I
spake
unto
you,
saying,
Ye
are
spies:
042:015
Hereby
ye
shall
be
proved:
By
the
life
of
Pharaoh
ye
shall
not
go
forth
hence,
except
your
youngest
brother
come
hither.
042:016
Send
one
of
you,
and
let
him
fetch
your
brother,
and
ye
shall
be
kept
in
prison,
that
your
words
may
be
proved,
whether
there
be
any
truth
in
you:
or
else
by
the
life
of
Pharaoh
surely
ye
