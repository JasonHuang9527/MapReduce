of
Baal.
010:020
And
Jehu
said,
Proclaim
a
solemn
assembly
for
Baal.
And
they
proclaimed
it.
010:021
And
Jehu
sent
through
all
Israel:
and
all
the
worshippers
of
Baal
came,
so
that
there
was
not
a
man
left
that
came
not.
And
they
came
into
the
house
of
Baal;
and
the
house
of
Baal
was
full
from
one
end
to
another.
010:022
And
he
said
unto
him
that
was
over
the
vestry,
Bring
forth
vestments
for
all
the
worshippers
of
Baal.
And
he
brought
them
forth
vestments.
010:023
And
Jehu
went,
and
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Rechab,
into
the
house
of
Baal,
and
said
unto
the
worshippers
of
Baal,
Search,
and
look
that
there
be
here
with
you
none
of
the
servants
of
the
LORD,
but
the
worshippers
of
Baal
only.
010:024
And
when
they
went
in
to
offer
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings,
Jehu
appointed
fourscore
men
without,
and
said,
If
any
of
the
men
whom
I
have
brought
into
your
hands
escape,
he
that
letteth
him
go,
his
life
shall
be
for
the
life
of
him.
010:025
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offering,
that
Jehu
said
to
the
guard
and
to
the
captains,
Go
in,
and
slay
them;
let
none
come
forth.
And
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword;
and
the
guard
and
the
captains
cast
them
out,
and
went
to
the
city
of
the
house
of
Baal.
010:026
And
they
brought
forth
the
images
out
of
the
house
of
Baal,
and
burned
them.
010:027
And
they
brake
down
the
image
of
Baal,
and
brake
down
the
house
of
Baal,
and
made
it
a
draught
house
unto
this
day.
010:028
Thus
Jehu
destroyed
Baal
out
of
Israel.
010:029
Howbeit
from
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
to
sin,
Jehu
departed
not
from
after
them,
to
wit,
the
golden
calves
that
were
in
Bethel,
and
that
were
in
Dan.
010:030
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Jehu,
Because
thou
hast
done
well
in
executing
that
which
is
right
in
mine
eyes,
and
hast
done
unto
the
house
of
Ahab
according
to
all
that
was
in
mine
heart,
thy
children
of
the
fourth
generation
shall
sit
on
the
throne
of
Israel.
010:031
But
Jehu
took
no
heed
to
walk
in
the
law
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
with
all
his
heart:
for
he
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
Jeroboam,
which
made
Israel
to
sin.
010:032
In
those
days
the
LORD
began
to
cut
Israel
short:
and
Hazael
smote
them
in
all
the
coasts
of
Israel;
010:033
From
Jordan
eastward,
all
the
land
of
Gilead,
the
Gadites,
and
the
Reubenites,
and
the
Manassites,
from
Aroer,
which
is
by
the
river
Arnon,
even
Gilead
and
Bashan.
010:034
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jehu,
and
all
that
he
did,
and
all
his
might,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
010:035
And
Jehu
slept
with
his
fathers:
and
they
buried
him
in
Samaria.
And
Jehoahaz
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
010:036
And
the
time
that
Jehu
reigned
over
Israel
in
Samaria
was
twenty
and
eight
years.
011:001
And
when
Athaliah
the
mother
of
Ahaziah
saw
that
her
son
was
dead,
she
arose
and
destroyed
all
the
seed
royal.
011:002
But
Jehosheba,
the
daughter
of
king
Joram,
sister
of
Ahaziah,
took
Joash
the
son
of
Ahaziah,
and
stole
him
from
among
the
king's
sons
which
were
slain;
and
they
hid
him,
even
him
and
his
nurse,
in
the
bedchamber
from
Athaliah,
so
that
he
was
not
slain.
011:003
And
he
was
with
her
hid
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
six
years.
And
Athaliah
did
reign
over
the
land.
011:004
And
the
seventh
year
Jehoiada
sent
and
fetched
the
rulers
over
hundreds,
with
the
captains
and
the
guard,
and
brought
them
to
him
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
made
a
covenant
with
them,
and
took
an
oath
of
them
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
shewed
them
the
king's
son.
011:005
And
he
commanded
them,
saying,
This
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do;
A
third
part
of
you
that
enter
in
on
the
sabbath
shall
even
be
keepers
of
the
watch
of
the
king's
house;
011:006
And
a
third
part
shall
be
at
the
gate
of
Sur;
and
a
third
part
at
the
gate
behind
the
guard:
so
shall
ye
keep
the
watch
of
the
house,
that
it
be
not
broken
down.
011:007
And
two
parts
of
all
you
that
go
forth
on
the
sabbath,
even
they
shall
keep
the
watch
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
about
the
king.
011:008
And
ye
shall
compass
the
king
round
about,
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand:
and
he
that
cometh
within
the
ranges,
let
him
be
slain:
and
be
ye
with
the
king
as
he
goeth
out
and
as
he
cometh
in.
011:009
And
the
captains
over
the
hundreds
did
according
to
all
things
that
Jehoiada
the
priest
commanded:
and
they
took
every
man
his
men
that
were
to
come
in
on
the
sabbath,
with
them
that
should
go
out
on
the
sabbath,
and
came
to
Jehoiada
the
priest.
011:010
And
to
the
captains
over
hundreds
did
the
priest
give
king
David's
spears
and
shields,
that
were
in
the
temple
of
the
LORD.
011:011
And
the
guard
stood,
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand,
round
about
the
king,
from
the
right
corner
of
the
temple
to
the
left
corner
of
the
temple,
along
by
the
altar
and
the
temple.
011:012
And
he
brought
forth
the
king's
son,
and
put
the
crown
upon
him,
and
gave
him
the
testimony;
and
they
made
him
king,
and
anointed
him;
and
they
clapped
their
hands,
and
said,
God
save
the
king.
011:013
And
when
Athaliah
heard
the
noise
of
the
guard
and
of
the
people,
she
came
to
the
people
into
the
temple
of
the
LORD.
011:014
And
when
she
looked,
behold,
the
king
stood
by
a
pillar,
as
the
manner
was,
and
the
princes
and
the
trumpeters
by
the
king,
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced,
and
blew
with
trumpets:
and
Athaliah
rent
her
clothes,
and
cried,
Treason,
Treason.
011:015
But
Jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
the
captains
of
the
hundreds,
the
officers
of
the
host,
and
said
unto
them,
Have
her
forth
without
the
ranges:
and
him
that
followeth
her
kill
with
the
sword.
For
the
priest
had
said,
Let
her
not
be
slain
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
011:016
And
they
laid
hands
on
her;
and
she
went
by
the
way
by
the
which
the
horses
came
into
the
king's
house:
and
there
was
she
slain.
011:017
And
Jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
the
LORD
and
the
king
and
the
people,
that
they
should
be
the
LORD's
people;
between
the
king
also
and
the
people.
011:018
And
all
the
people
of
the
land
went
into
the
house
of
Baal,
and
brake
it
down;
his
altars
and
his
images
brake
they
in
pieces
thoroughly,
and
slew
Mattan
the
priest
of
Baal
before
the
altars.
And
the
priest
appointed
officers
over
the
house
of
the
LORD.
011:019
And
he
took
the
rulers
over
hundreds,
and
the
captains,
and
the
guard,
and
all
the
people
of
the
land;
and
they
brought
down
the
king
from
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
came
by
the
way
of
the
gate
of
the
guard
to
the
king's
house.
And
he
sat
on
the
throne
of
the
kings.
011:020
And
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced,
and
the
city
was
in
quiet:
and
they
slew
Athaliah
with
the
sword
beside
the
king's
house.
011:021
Seven
years
old
was
Jehoash
when
he
began
to
reign.
012:001
In
the
seventh
year
of
Jehu
Jehoash
began
to
reign;
and
forty
years
reigned
he
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Zibiah
of
Beersheba.
012:002
And
Jehoash
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
all
his
days
wherein
Jehoiada
the
priest
instructed
him.
012:003
But
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away:
the
people
still
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
the
high
places.
012:004
And
Jehoash
said
to
the
priests,
All
the
money
of
the
dedicated
things
that
is
brought
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
even
the
money
of
every
one
that
passeth
the
account,
the
money
that
every
man
is
set
at,
and
all
the
money
that
cometh
into
any
man's
heart
to
bring
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
012:005
Let
the
priests
take
it
to
them,
every
man
of
his
acquaintance:
and
let
them
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house,
wheresoever
any
breach
shall
be
found.
012:006
But
it
was
so,
that
in
the
three
and
twentieth
year
of
king
Jehoash
the
priests
had
not
repaired
the
breaches
of
the
house.
012:007
Then
king
Jehoash
called
for
Jehoiada
the
priest,
and
the
other
priests,
and
said
unto
them,
Why
repair
ye
not
the
breaches
of
the
house?
now
therefore
receive
no
more
money
of
your
acquaintance,
but
deliver
it
for
the
breaches
of
the
house.
012:008
And
the
priests
consented
to
receive
no
more
money
of
the
people,
neither
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house.
012:009
But
Jehoiada
the
priest
took
a
chest,
and
bored
a
hole
in
the
lid
of
it,
and
set
it
beside
the
altar,
on
the
right
side
as
one
cometh
into
the
house
of
the
LORD:
and
the
priests
that
kept
the
door
put
therein
all
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
LORD.
012:010
And
it
was
so,
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money
in
the
chest,
that
the
king's
scribe
and
the
high
priest
came
up,
and
they
put
up
in
bags,
and
told
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
012:011
And
they
gave
the
money,
being
told,
into
the
hands
of
them
that
did
the
work,
that
had
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
LORD:
and
they
laid
it
out
to
the
carpenters
and
builders,
that
wrought
upon
the
house
of
the
LORD,
012:012
And
to
masons,
and
hewers
of
stone,
and
to
buy
timber
and
hewed
stone
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
for
all
that
was
laid
out
for
the
house
to
repair
it.
012:013
Howbeit
there
were
not
made
for
the
house
of
the
LORD
bowls
of
silver,
snuffers,
basons,
trumpets,
any
vessels
of
gold,
or
vessels
of
silver,
of
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
LORD:
012:014
But
they
gave
that
to
the
workmen,
and
repaired
therewith
the
house
of
the
LORD.
012:015
Moreover
they
reckoned
not
with
the
men,
into
whose
hand
they
delivered
the
money
to
be
bestowed
on
workmen:
for
they
dealt
faithfully.
012:016
The
trespass
money
and
sin
money
was
not
brought
into
the
house
of
the
LORD:
it
was
the
priests'.
012:017
Then
Hazael
king
of
Syria
went
up,
and
fought
against
Gath,
and
took
it:
and
Hazael
set
his
face
to
go
up
to
Jerusalem.
012:018
And
Jehoash
king
of
Judah
took
all
the
hallowed
things
that
Jehoshaphat,
and
Jehoram,
and
Ahaziah,
his
fathers,
kings
of
Judah,
had
dedicated,
and
his
own
hallowed
things,
and
all
the
gold
that
was
found
in
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
in
the
king's
house,
and
sent
it
to
Hazael
king
of
Syria:
and
he
went
away
from
Jerusalem.
012:019
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Joash,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
012:020
And
his
servants
arose,
and
made
a
conspiracy,
and
slew
Joash
in
the
house
of
Millo,
which
goeth
down
to
Silla.
012:021
For
Jozachar
the
son
of
Shimeath,
and
Jehozabad
the
son
of
Shomer,
his
servants,
smote
him,
and
he
died;
and
they
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David:
and
Amaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
013:001
In
the
three
and
twentieth
year
of
Joash
the
son
of
Ahaziah
king
of
Judah
Jehoahaz
the
son
of
Jehu
began
to
reign
over
Israel
in
Samaria,
and
reigned
seventeen
years.
013:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
followed
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
which
made
Israel
to
sin;
he
departed
not
therefrom.
013:003
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Israel,
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
Hazael
king
of
Syria,
and
into
the
hand
of
Benhadad
the
son
of
Hazael,
all
their
days.
013:004
And
Jehoahaz
besought
the
LORD,
and
the
LORD
hearkened
unto
him:
for
he
saw
the
oppression
of
Israel,
because
the
king
of
Syria
oppressed
them.
013:005
(And
the
LORD
gave
Israel
a
saviour,
so
that
they
went
out
from
under
the
hand
of
the
Syrians:
and
the
children
of
Israel
dwelt
in
their
tents,
as
beforetime.
013:006
Nevertheless
they
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
the
house
of
Jeroboam,
who
made
Israel
sin,
but
walked
therein:
and
there
remained
the
grove
also
in
Samaria.)
013:007
Neither
did
he
leave
of
the
people
to
Jehoahaz
but
fifty
horsemen,
and
ten
chariots,
and
ten
thousand
footmen;
for
the
king
of
Syria
had
destroyed
them,
and
had
made
them
like
the
dust
by
threshing.
013:008
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jehoahaz,
and
all
that
he
did,
and
his
might,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
013:009
And
Jehoahaz
slept
with
his
fathers;
and
they
buried
him
in
Samaria:
and
Joash
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
013:010
In
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
of
Joash
king
of
Judah
began
Jehoash
the
son
of
Jehoahaz
to
reign
over
Israel
in
Samaria,
and
reigned
sixteen
years.
013:011
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD;
he
departed
not
from
all
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
sin:
but
he
walked
therein.
013:012
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Joash,
and
all
that
he
did,
and
his
might
wherewith
he
fought
against
Amaziah
king
of
Judah,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
013:013
And
Joash
slept
with
his
fathers;
and
Jeroboam
sat
upon
his
throne:
and
Joash
was
buried
in
Samaria
with
the
kings
of
Israel.
013:014
Now
Elisha
was
fallen
sick
of
his
sickness
whereof
he
died.
And
Joash
the
king
of
Israel
came
down
unto
him,
and
wept
over
his
face,
and
said,
O
my
father,
my
father,
the
chariot
of
Israel,
and
the
horsemen
thereof.
013:015
And
Elisha
said
unto
him,
Take
bow
and
arrows.
And
he
took
unto
him
bow
and
arrows.
013:016
And
he
said
to
the
king
of
Israel,
Put
thine
hand
upon
the
bow.
And
he
put
his
hand
upon
it:
and
Elisha
put
his
hands
upon
the
king's
hands.
013:017
And
he
said,
Open
the
window
eastward.
And
he
opened
it.
Then
Elisha
said,
Shoot.
And
he
shot.
And
he
said,
The
arrow
of
the
LORD's
deliverance,
and
the
arrow
of
deliverance
from
Syria:
for
thou
shalt
smite
the
Syrians
in
Aphek,
till
thou
have
consumed
them.
013:018
And
he
said,
Take
the
arrows.
And
he
took
them.
And
he
said
unto
the
king
of
Israel,
Smite
upon
the
ground.
And
he
smote
thrice,
and
stayed.
013:019
And
the
man
of
God
was
wroth
with
him,
and
said,
Thou
shouldest
have
smitten
five
or
six
times;
then
hadst
thou
smitten
Syria
till
thou
hadst
consumed
it:
whereas
now
thou
shalt
smite
Syria
but
thrice.
013:020
And
Elisha
died,
and
they
buried
him.
And
the
bands
of
the
Moabites
invaded
the
land
at
the
coming
in
of
the
year.
013:021
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
they
were
burying
a
man,
that,
behold,
they
spied
a
band
of
men;
and
they
cast
the
man
into
the
sepulchre
of
Elisha:
and
when
the
man
was
let
down,
and
touched
the
bones
of
Elisha,
he
revived,
and
stood
up
on
his
feet.
013:022
But
Hazael
king
of
Syria
oppressed
Israel
all
the
days
of
Jehoahaz.
013:023
And
the
LORD
was
gracious
unto
them,
and
had
compassion
on
them,
and
had
respect
unto
them,
because
of
his
covenant
with
Abraham,
Isaac,
and
Jacob,
and
would
not
destroy
them,
neither
cast
he
them
from
his
presence
as
yet.
013:024
So
Hazael
king
of
Syria
died;
and
Benhadad
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
013:025
And
Jehoash
the
son
of
Jehoahaz
took
again
out
of
the
hand
of
Benhadad
the
son
of
Hazael
the
cities,
which
he
had
taken
out
of
the
hand
of
Jehoahaz
his
father
by
war.
Three
times
did
Joash
beat
him,
and
recovered
the
cities
of
Israel.
014:001
In
the
second
year
of
Joash
son
of
Jehoahaz
king
of
Israel
reigned
Amaziah
the
son
of
Joash
king
of
Judah.
014:002
He
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Jehoaddan
of
Jerusalem.
014:003
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
yet
not
like
David
his
father:
he
did
according
to
all
things
as
Joash
his
father
did.
014:004
Howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away:
as
yet
the
people
did
sacrifice
and
burnt
incense
on
the
high
places.
014:005
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
soon
as
the
kingdom
was
confirmed
in
his
hand,
that
he
slew
his
servants
which
had
slain
the
king
his
father.
014:006
But
the
children
of
the
murderers
he
slew
not:
according
unto
that
which
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
Moses,
wherein
the
LORD
commanded,
saying,
The
fathers
shall
not
be
put
to
death
for
the
children,
nor
the
children
be
put
to
death
for
the
fathers;
but
every
man
shall
be
put
to
death
for
his
own
sin.
014:007
He
slew
of
Edom
in
the
valley
of
salt
ten
thousand,
and
took
Selah
by
war,
and
called
the
name
of
it
Joktheel
unto
this
day.
014:008
Then
Amaziah
sent
messengers
to
Jehoash,
the
son
of
Jehoahaz
son
of
Jehu,
king
of
Israel,
saying,
Come,
let
us
look
one
another
in
the
face.
014:009
And
Jehoash
the
king
of
Israel
sent
to
Amaziah
king
of
Judah,
saying,
The
thistle
that
was
in
Lebanon
sent
to
the
cedar
that
was
in
Lebanon,
saying,
Give
thy
daughter
to
my
son
to
wife:
and
there
passed
by
a
wild
beast
that
was
in
Lebanon,
and
trode
down
the
thistle.
014:010
Thou
hast
indeed
smitten
Edom,
and
thine
heart
hath
lifted
thee
up:
glory
of
this,
and
tarry
at
home:
for
why
shouldest
thou
meddle
to
thy
hurt,
that
thou
shouldest
fall,
even
thou,
and
Judah
with
thee?
014:011
But
Amaziah
would
not
hear.
Therefore
Jehoash
king
of
Israel
went
up;
and
he
and
Amaziah
king
of
Judah
looked
one
another
in
the
face
at
Bethshemesh,
which
belongeth
to
Judah.
014:012
And
Judah
was
put
to
the
worse
before
Israel;
and
they
fled
every
man
to
their
tents.
014:013
And
Jehoash
king
of
Israel
took
Amaziah
king
of
Judah,
the
son
of
Jehoash
the
son
of
Ahaziah,
at
Bethshemesh,
and
came
to
Jerusalem,
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
from
the
gate
of
Ephraim
unto
the
corner
gate,
four
hundred
cubits.
014:014
And
he
took
all
the
gold
and
silver,
and
all
the
vessels
that
were
found
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
in
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house,
and
hostages,
and
returned
to
Samaria.
014:015
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jehoash
which
he
did,
and
his
might,
and
how
he
fought
with
Amaziah
king
of
Judah,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
014:016
And
Jehoash
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
in
Samaria
with
the
kings
of
Israel;
and
Jeroboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
014:017
And
Amaziah
the
son
of
Joash
king
of
Judah
lived
after
the
death
of
Jehoash
son
of
Jehoahaz
king
of
Israel
fifteen
years.
014:018
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Amaziah,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
014:019
Now
they
made
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
Jerusalem:
and
he
fled
to
Lachish;
but
they
sent
after
him
to
Lachish,
and
slew
him
there.
014:020
And
they
brought
him
on
horses:
and
he
was
buried
at
Jerusalem
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David.
014:021
And
all
the
people
of
Judah
took
Azariah,
which
was
sixteen
years
old,
and
made
him
king
instead
of
his
father
Amaziah.
014:022
He
built
Elath,
and
restored
it
to
Judah,
after
that
the
king
slept
with
his
fathers.
014:023
In
the
fifteenth
year
of
Amaziah
the
son
of
Joash
king
of
Judah
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Joash
king
of
Israel
began
to
reign
in
Samaria,
and
reigned
forty
and
one
years.
014:024
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
he
departed
not
from
all
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
to
sin.
014:025
He
restored
the
coast
of
Israel
from
the
entering
of
Hamath
unto
the
sea
of
the
plain,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
his
servant
Jonah,
the
son
of
Amittai,
the
prophet,
which
was
of
Gathhepher.
014:026
For
the
LORD
saw
the
affliction
of
Israel,
that
it
was
very
bitter:
for
there
was
not
any
shut
up,
nor
any
left,
nor
any
helper
for
Israel.
014:027
And
the
LORD
said
not
that
he
would
blot
out
the
name
of
Israel
from
under
heaven:
but
he
saved
them
by
the
hand
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Joash.
014:028
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jeroboam,
and
all
that
he
did,
and
his
might,
how
he
warred,
and
how
he
recovered
Damascus,
and
Hamath,
which
belonged
to
Judah,
for
Israel,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
014:029
And
Jeroboam
slept
with
his
fathers,
even
with
the
kings
of
Israel;
and
Zachariah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:001
In
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
Jeroboam
king
of
Israel
began
Azariah
son
of
Amaziah
king
of
Judah
to
reign.
015:002
Sixteen
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
two
and
fifty
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Jecholiah
of
Jerusalem.
015:003
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
his
father
Amaziah
had
done;
015:004
Save
that
the
high
places
were
not
removed:
the
people
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
still
on
the
high
places.
015:005
And
the
LORD
smote
the
king,
so
that
he
was
a
leper
unto
the
day
of
his
death,
and
dwelt
in
a
several
house.
And
Jotham
the
king's
son
was
over
the
house,
judging
the
people
of
the
land.
015:006
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Azariah,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
015:007
So
Azariah
slept
with
his
fathers;
and
they
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David:
and
Jotham
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:008
In
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
of
Azariah
king
of
Judah
did
Zachariah
the
son
of
Jeroboam
reign
over
Israel
in
Samaria
six
months.
015:009
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
as
his
fathers
had
done:
he
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
to
sin.
015:010
And
Shallum
the
son
of
Jabesh
conspired
against
him,
and
smote
him
before
the
people,
and
slew
him,
and
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:011
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Zachariah,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel.
015:012
This
was
the
word
of
the
LORD
which
he
spake
unto
Jehu,
saying,
Thy
sons
shall
sit
on
the
throne
of
Israel
unto
the
fourth
generation.
And
so
it
came
to
pass.
015:013
Shallum
the
son
of
Jabesh
began
to
reign
in
the
nine
and
thirtieth
year
of
Uzziah
king
of
Judah;
and
he
reigned
a
full
month
in
Samaria.
015:014
For
Menahem
the
son
of
Gadi
went
up
from
Tirzah,
and
came
to
Samaria,
and
smote
Shallum
the
son
of
Jabesh
in
Samaria,
and
