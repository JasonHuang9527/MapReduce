slew
him,
and
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:015
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Shallum,
and
his
conspiracy
which
he
made,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel.
015:016
Then
Menahem
smote
Tiphsah,
and
all
that
were
therein,
and
the
coasts
thereof
from
Tirzah:
because
they
opened
not
to
him,
therefore
he
smote
it;
and
all
the
women
therein
that
were
with
child
he
ripped
up.
015:017
In
the
nine
and
thirtieth
year
of
Azariah
king
of
Judah
began
Menahem
the
son
of
Gadi
to
reign
over
Israel,
and
reigned
ten
years
in
Samaria.
015:018
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
he
departed
not
all
his
days
from
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
to
sin.
015:019
And
Pul
the
king
of
Assyria
came
against
the
land:
and
Menahem
gave
Pul
a
thousand
talents
of
silver,
that
his
hand
might
be
with
him
to
confirm
the
kingdom
in
his
hand.
015:020
And
Menahem
exacted
the
money
of
Israel,
even
of
all
the
mighty
men
of
wealth,
of
each
man
fifty
shekels
of
silver,
to
give
to
the
king
of
Assyria.
So
the
king
of
Assyria
turned
back,
and
stayed
not
there
in
the
land.
015:021
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Menahem,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel?
015:022
And
Menahem
slept
with
his
fathers;
and
Pekahiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
015:023
In
the
fiftieth
year
of
Azariah
king
of
Judah
Pekahiah
the
son
of
Menahem
began
to
reign
over
Israel
in
Samaria,
and
reigned
two
years.
015:024
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
he
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
to
sin.
015:025
But
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah,
a
captain
of
his,
conspired
against
him,
and
smote
him
in
Samaria,
in
the
palace
of
the
king's
house,
with
Argob
and
Arieh,
and
with
him
fifty
men
of
the
Gileadites:
and
he
killed
him,
and
reigned
in
his
room.
015:026
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Pekahiah,
and
all
that
he
did,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel.
015:027
In
the
two
and
fiftieth
year
of
Azariah
king
of
Judah
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
began
to
reign
over
Israel
in
Samaria,
and
reigned
twenty
years.
015:028
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
he
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
to
sin.
015:029
In
the
days
of
Pekah
king
of
Israel
came
Tiglathpileser
king
of
Assyria,
and
took
Ijon,
and
Abelbethmaachah,
and
Janoah,
and
Kedesh,
and
Hazor,
and
Gilead,
and
Galilee,
all
the
land
of
Naphtali,
and
carried
them
captive
to
Assyria.
015:030
And
Hoshea
the
son
of
Elah
made
a
conspiracy
against
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah,
and
smote
him,
and
slew
him,
and
reigned
in
his
stead,
in
the
twentieth
year
of
Jotham
the
son
of
Uzziah.
015:031
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Pekah,
and
all
that
he
did,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Israel.
015:032
In
the
second
year
of
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
king
of
Israel
began
Jotham
the
son
of
Uzziah
king
of
Judah
to
reign.
015:033
Five
and
twenty
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
sixteen
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Jerusha,
the
daughter
of
Zadok.
015:034
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD:
he
did
according
to
all
that
his
father
Uzziah
had
done.
015:035
Howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
removed:
the
people
sacrificed
and
burned
incense
still
in
the
high
places.
He
built
the
higher
gate
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
015:036
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jotham,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
015:037
In
those
days
the
LORD
began
to
send
against
Judah
Rezin
the
king
of
Syria,
and
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah.
015:038
And
Jotham
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David
his
father:
and
Ahaz
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
016:001
In
the
seventeenth
year
of
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
Ahaz
the
son
of
Jotham
king
of
Judah
began
to
reign.
016:002
Twenty
years
old
was
Ahaz
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
reigned
sixteen
years
in
Jerusalem,
and
did
not
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
his
God,
like
David
his
father.
016:003
But
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
Israel,
yea,
and
made
his
son
to
pass
through
the
fire,
according
to
the
abominations
of
the
heathen,
whom
the
LORD
cast
out
from
before
the
children
of
Israel.
016:004
And
he
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
the
high
places,
and
on
the
hills,
and
under
every
green
tree.
016:005
Then
Rezin
king
of
Syria
and
Pekah
son
of
Remaliah
king
of
Israel
came
up
to
Jerusalem
to
war:
and
they
besieged
Ahaz,
but
could
not
overcome
him.
016:006
At
that
time
Rezin
king
of
Syria
recovered
Elath
to
Syria,
and
drave
the
Jews
from
Elath:
and
the
Syrians
came
to
Elath,
and
dwelt
there
unto
this
day.
016:007
So
Ahaz
sent
messengers
to
Tiglathpileser
king
of
Assyria,
saying,
I
am
thy
servant
and
thy
son:
come
up,
and
save
me
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Syria,
and
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Israel,
which
rise
up
against
me.
016:008
And
Ahaz
took
the
silver
and
gold
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
in
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house,
and
sent
it
for
a
present
to
the
king
of
Assyria.
016:009
And
the
king
of
Assyria
hearkened
unto
him:
for
the
king
of
Assyria
went
up
against
Damascus,
and
took
it,
and
carried
the
people
of
it
captive
to
Kir,
and
slew
Rezin.
016:010
And
king
Ahaz
went
to
Damascus
to
meet
Tiglathpileser
king
of
Assyria,
and
saw
an
altar
that
was
at
Damascus:
and
king
Ahaz
sent
to
Urijah
the
priest
the
fashion
of
the
altar,
and
the
pattern
of
it,
according
to
all
the
workmanship
thereof.
016:011
And
Urijah
the
priest
built
an
altar
according
to
all
that
king
Ahaz
had
sent
from
Damascus:
so
Urijah
the
priest
made
it
against
king
Ahaz
came
from
Damascus.
016:012
And
when
the
king
was
come
from
Damascus,
the
king
saw
the
altar:
and
the
king
approached
to
the
altar,
and
offered
thereon.
016:013
And
he
burnt
his
burnt
offering
and
his
meat
offering,
and
poured
his
drink
offering,
and
sprinkled
the
blood
of
his
peace
offerings,
upon
the
altar.
016:014
And
he
brought
also
the
brasen
altar,
which
was
before
the
LORD,
from
the
forefront
of
the
house,
from
between
the
altar
and
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
put
it
on
the
north
side
of
the
altar.
016:015
And
king
Ahaz
commanded
Urijah
the
priest,
saying,
Upon
the
great
altar
burn
the
morning
burnt
offering,
and
the
evening
meat
offering,
and
the
king's
burnt
sacrifice,
and
his
meat
offering,
with
the
burnt
offering
of
all
the
people
of
the
land,
and
their
meat
offering,
and
their
drink
offerings;
and
sprinkle
upon
it
all
the
blood
of
the
burnt
offering,
and
all
the
blood
of
the
sacrifice:
and
the
brasen
altar
shall
be
for
me
to
enquire
by.
016:016
Thus
did
Urijah
the
priest,
according
to
all
that
king
Ahaz
commanded.
016:017
And
king
Ahaz
cut
off
the
borders
of
the
bases,
and
removed
the
laver
from
off
them;
and
took
down
the
sea
from
off
the
brasen
oxen
that
were
under
it,
and
put
it
upon
the
pavement
of
stones.
016:018
And
the
covert
for
the
sabbath
that
they
had
built
in
the
house,
and
the
king's
entry
without,
turned
he
from
the
house
of
the
LORD
for
the
king
of
Assyria.
016:019
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Ahaz
which
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
016:020
And
Ahaz
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David:
and
Hezekiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
017:001
In
the
twelfth
year
of
Ahaz
king
of
Judah
began
Hoshea
the
son
of
Elah
to
reign
in
Samaria
over
Israel
nine
years.
017:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
but
not
as
the
kings
of
Israel
that
were
before
him.
017:003
Against
him
came
up
Shalmaneser
king
of
Assyria;
and
Hoshea
became
his
servant,
and
gave
him
presents.
017:004
And
the
king
of
Assyria
found
conspiracy
in
Hoshea:
for
he
had
sent
messengers
to
So
king
of
Egypt,
and
brought
no
present
to
the
king
of
Assyria,
as
he
had
done
year
by
year:
therefore
the
king
of
Assyria
shut
him
up,
and
bound
him
in
prison.
017:005
Then
the
king
of
Assyria
came
up
throughout
all
the
land,
and
went
up
to
Samaria,
and
besieged
it
three
years.
017:006
In
the
ninth
year
of
Hoshea
the
king
of
Assyria
took
Samaria,
and
carried
Israel
away
into
Assyria,
and
placed
them
in
Halah
and
in
Habor
by
the
river
of
Gozan,
and
in
the
cities
of
the
Medes.
017:007
For
so
it
was,
that
the
children
of
Israel
had
sinned
against
the
LORD
their
God,
which
had
brought
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
from
under
the
hand
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt,
and
had
feared
other
gods,
017:008
And
walked
in
the
statutes
of
the
heathen,
whom
the
LORD
cast
out
from
before
the
children
of
Israel,
and
of
the
kings
of
Israel,
which
they
had
made.
017:009
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
secretly
those
things
that
were
not
right
against
the
LORD
their
God,
and
they
built
them
high
places
in
all
their
cities,
from
the
tower
of
the
watchmen
to
the
fenced
city.
017:010
And
they
set
them
up
images
and
groves
in
every
high
hill,
and
under
every
green
tree:
017:011
And
there
they
burnt
incense
in
all
the
high
places,
as
did
the
heathen
whom
the
LORD
carried
away
before
them;
and
wrought
wicked
things
to
provoke
the
LORD
to
anger:
017:012
For
they
served
idols,
whereof
the
LORD
had
said
unto
them,
Ye
shall
not
do
this
thing.
017:013
Yet
the
LORD
testified
against
Israel,
and
against
Judah,
by
all
the
prophets,
and
by
all
the
seers,
saying,
Turn
ye
from
your
evil
ways,
and
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes,
according
to
all
the
law
which
I
commanded
your
fathers,
and
which
I
sent
to
you
by
my
servants
the
prophets.
017:014
Notwithstanding
they
would
not
hear,
but
hardened
their
necks,
like
to
the
neck
of
their
fathers,
that
did
not
believe
in
the
LORD
their
God.
017:015
And
they
rejected
his
statutes,
and
his
covenant
that
he
made
with
their
fathers,
and
his
testimonies
which
he
testified
against
them;
and
they
followed
vanity,
and
became
vain,
and
went
after
the
heathen
that
were
round
about
them,
concerning
whom
the
LORD
had
charged
them,
that
they
should
not
do
like
them.
017:016
And
they
left
all
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
their
God,
and
made
them
molten
images,
even
two
calves,
and
made
a
grove,
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven,
and
served
Baal.
017:017
And
they
caused
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
pass
through
the
fire,
and
used
divination
and
enchantments,
and
sold
themselves
to
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
to
provoke
him
to
anger.
017:018
Therefore
the
LORD
was
very
angry
with
Israel,
and
removed
them
out
of
his
sight:
there
was
none
left
but
the
tribe
of
Judah
only.
017:019
Also
Judah
kept
not
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
their
God,
but
walked
in
the
statutes
of
Israel
which
they
made.
017:020
And
the
LORD
rejected
all
the
seed
of
Israel,
and
afflicted
them,
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
spoilers,
until
he
had
cast
them
out
of
his
sight.
017:021
For
he
rent
Israel
from
the
house
of
David;
and
they
made
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
king:
and
Jeroboam
drave
Israel
from
following
the
LORD,
and
made
them
sin
a
great
sin.
017:022
For
the
children
of
Israel
walked
in
all
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
which
he
did;
they
departed
not
from
them;
017:023
Until
the
LORD
removed
Israel
out
of
his
sight,
as
he
had
said
by
all
his
servants
the
prophets.
So
was
Israel
carried
away
out
of
their
own
land
to
Assyria
unto
this
day.
017:024
And
the
king
of
Assyria
brought
men
from
Babylon,
and
from
Cuthah,
and
from
Ava,
and
from
Hamath,
and
from
Sepharvaim,
and
placed
them
in
the
cities
of
Samaria
instead
of
the
children
of
Israel:
and
they
possessed
Samaria,
and
dwelt
in
the
cities
thereof.
017:025
And
so
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
their
dwelling
there,
that
they
feared
not
the
LORD:
therefore
the
LORD
sent
lions
among
them,
which
slew
some
of
them.
017:026
Wherefore
they
spake
to
the
king
of
Assyria,
saying,
The
nations
which
thou
hast
removed,
and
placed
in
the
cities
of
Samaria,
know
not
the
manner
of
the
God
of
the
land:
therefore
he
hath
sent
lions
among
them,
and,
behold,
they
slay
them,
because
they
know
not
the
manner
of
the
God
of
the
land.
017:027
Then
the
king
of
Assyria
commanded,
saying,
Carry
thither
one
of
the
priests
whom
ye
brought
from
thence;
and
let
them
go
and
dwell
there,
and
let
him
teach
them
the
manner
of
the
God
of
the
land.
017:028
Then
one
of
the
priests
whom
they
had
carried
away
from
Samaria
came
and
dwelt
in
Bethel,
and
taught
them
how
they
should
fear
the
LORD.
017:029
Howbeit
every
nation
made
gods
of
their
own,
and
put
them
in
the
houses
of
the
high
places
which
the
Samaritans
had
made,
every
nation
in
their
cities
wherein
they
dwelt.
017:030
And
the
men
of
Babylon
made
Succothbenoth,
and
the
men
of
Cuth
made
Nergal,
and
the
men
of
Hamath
made
Ashima,
017:031
And
the
Avites
made
Nibhaz
and
Tartak,
and
the
Sepharvites
burnt
their
children
in
fire
to
Adrammelech
and
Anammelech,
the
gods
of
Sepharvaim.
017:032
So
they
feared
the
LORD,
and
made
unto
themselves
of
the
lowest
of
them
priests
of
the
high
places,
which
sacrificed
for
them
in
the
houses
of
the
high
places.
017:033
They
feared
the
LORD,
and
served
their
own
gods,
after
the
manner
of
the
nations
whom
they
carried
away
from
thence.
017:034
Unto
this
day
they
do
after
the
former
manners:
they
fear
not
the
LORD,
neither
do
they
after
their
statutes,
or
after
their
ordinances,
or
after
the
law
and
commandment
which
the
LORD
commanded
the
children
of
Jacob,
whom
he
named
Israel;
017:035
With
whom
the
LORD
had
made
a
covenant,
and
charged
them,
saying,
Ye
shall
not
fear
other
gods,
nor
bow
yourselves
to
them,
nor
serve
them,
nor
sacrifice
to
them:
017:036
But
the
LORD,
who
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
great
power
and
a
stretched
out
arm,
him
shall
ye
fear,
and
him
shall
ye
worship,
and
to
him
shall
ye
do
sacrifice.
017:037
And
the
statutes,
and
the
ordinances,
and
the
law,
and
the
commandment,
which
he
wrote
for
you,
ye
shall
observe
to
do
for
evermore;
and
ye
shall
not
fear
other
gods.
017:038
And
the
covenant
that
I
have
made
with
you
ye
shall
not
forget;
neither
shall
ye
fear
other
gods.
017:039
But
the
LORD
your
God
ye
shall
fear;
and
he
shall
deliver
you
out
of
the
hand
of
all
your
enemies.
017:040
Howbeit
they
did
not
hearken,
but
they
did
after
their
former
manner.
017:041
So
these
nations
feared
the
LORD,
and
served
their
graven
images,
both
their
children,
and
their
children's
children:
as
did
their
fathers,
so
do
they
unto
this
day.
018:001
Now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
third
year
of
Hoshea
son
of
Elah
king
of
Israel,
that
Hezekiah
the
son
of
Ahaz
king
of
Judah
began
to
reign.
018:002
Twenty
and
five
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign;
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
Jerusalem.
His
mother's
name
also
was
Abi,
the
daughter
of
Zachariah.
018:003
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
David
his
father
did.
018:004
He
removed
the
high
places,
and
brake
the
images,
and
cut
down
the
groves,
and
brake
in
pieces
the
brasen
serpent
that
Moses
had
made:
for
unto
those
days
the
children
of
Israel
did
burn
incense
to
it:
and
he
called
it
Nehushtan.
018:005
He
trusted
in
the
LORD
God
of
Israel;
so
that
after
him
was
none
like
him
among
all
the
kings
of
Judah,
nor
any
that
were
before
him.
018:006
For
he
clave
to
the
LORD,
and
departed
not
from
following
him,
but
kept
his
commandments,
which
the
LORD
commanded
Moses.
018:007
And
the
LORD
was
with
him;
and
he
prospered
whithersoever
he
went
forth:
and
he
rebelled
against
the
king
of
Assyria,
and
served
him
not.
018:008
He
smote
the
Philistines,
even
unto
Gaza,
and
the
borders
thereof,
from
the
tower
of
the
watchmen
to
the
fenced
city.
018:009
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
king
Hezekiah,
which
was
the
seventh
year
of
Hoshea
son
of
Elah
king
of
Israel,
that
Shalmaneser
king
of
Assyria
came
up
against
Samaria,
and
besieged
it.
018:010
And
at
the
end
of
three
years
they
took
it:
even
in
the
sixth
year
of
Hezekiah,
that
is
in
the
ninth
year
of
Hoshea
king
of
Israel,
Samaria
was
taken.
018:011
And
the
king
of
Assyria
did
carry
away
Israel
unto
Assyria,
and
put
them
in
Halah
and
in
Habor
by
the
river
of
Gozan,
and
in
the
cities
of
the
Medes:
018:012
Because
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
LORD
their
God,
but
transgressed
his
covenant,
and
all
that
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
commanded,
and
would
not
hear
them,
nor
do
them.
018:013
Now
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
king
Hezekiah
did
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria
come
up
against
all
the
fenced
cities
of
Judah,
and
took
them.
018:014
And
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah
sent
to
the
king
of
Assyria
to
Lachish,
saying,
I
have
offended;
return
from
me:
that
which
thou
puttest
on
me
will
I
bear.
And
the
king
of
Assyria
appointed
unto
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah
three
hundred
talents
of
silver
and
thirty
talents
of
gold.
018:015
And
Hezekiah
gave
him
all
the
silver
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
in
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house.
018:016
At
that
time
did
Hezekiah
cut
off
the
gold
from
the
doors
of
the
temple
of
the
LORD,
and
from
the
pillars
which
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah
had
overlaid,
and
gave
it
to
the
king
of
Assyria.
018:017
And
the
king
of
Assyria
sent
Tartan
and
Rabsaris
and
Rabshakeh
from
Lachish
to
king
Hezekiah
with
a
great
host
against
Jerusalem.
And
they
went
up
and
came
to
Jerusalem.
And
when
they
were
come
up,
they
came
and
stood
by
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool,
which
is
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller's
field.
018:018
And
when
they
had
called
to
the
king,
there
came
out
to
them
Eliakim
the
son
of
Hilkiah,
which
was
over
the
household,
and
Shebna
the
scribe,
and
Joah
the
son
of
Asaph
the
recorder.
018:019
And
Rabshakeh
said
unto
them,
Speak
ye
now
to
Hezekiah,
Thus
saith
the
great
king,
the
king
of
Assyria,
What
confidence
is
this
wherein
thou
trustest?
018:020
Thou
sayest,
(but
they
are
but
vain
words,)
I
have
counsel
and
strength
for
the
war.
Now
on
whom
dost
thou
trust,
that
thou
rebellest
against
me?
018:021
Now,
behold,
thou
trustest
upon
the
staff
of
this
bruised
reed,
even
upon
Egypt,
on
which
if
a
man
lean,
it
will
go
into
his
hand,
and
pierce
it:
so
is
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
unto
all
that
trust
on
him.
018:022
But
if
ye
say
unto
me,
We
trust
in
the
LORD
our
God:
is
not
that
he,
whose
high
places
and
whose
altars
Hezekiah
hath
taken
away,
and
hath
said
to
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
Ye
shall
worship
before
this
altar
in
Jerusalem?
018:023
Now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
give
pledges
to
my
lord
the
king
of
Assyria,
and
I
will
deliver
thee
two
thousand
horses,
if
thou
be
able
on
thy
part
to
set
riders
upon
them.
018:024
How
then
wilt
thou
turn
away
the
face
of
one
captain
of
the
least
of
my
master's
servants,
and
put
thy
trust
on
Egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen?
018:025
Am
I
now
come
up
without
the
LORD
against
this
place
to
destroy
it?
The
LORD
said
to
me,
Go
up
against
this
land,
and
destroy
it.
018:026
Then
said
Eliakim
the
son
of
Hilkiah,
and
Shebna,
and
Joah,
unto
Rabshakeh,
Speak,
I
pray
thee,
to
thy
servants
in
the
Syrian
language;
for
we
understand
it:
and
talk
not
with
us
in
the
Jews'
language
in
the
ears
of
the
people
that
are
on
the
wall.
018:027
But
Rabshakeh
said
unto
them,
Hath
my
master
sent
me
to
thy
master,
and
to
thee,
to
speak
these
words?
hath
he
not
sent
me
to
the
men
which
sit
on
the
wall,
that
they
may
eat
their
own
dung,
and
drink
their
own
piss
with
you?
018:028
Then
Rabshakeh
stood
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
Jews'
language,
and
spake,
saying,
Hear
the
word
of
the
great
king,
the
king
of
Assyria:
018:029
Thus
saith
the
king,
Let
not
Hezekiah
deceive
you:
for
he
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
you
out
of
his
hand:
018:030
Neither
let
Hezekiah
make
you
trust
in
the
LORD,
saying,
The
LORD
will
surely
deliver
us,
and
this
city
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria.
018:031
Hearken
not
to
Hezekiah:
for
thus
saith
the
king
of
Assyria,
Make
an
agreement
with
me
by
a
present,
and
come
out
to
me,
and
then
eat
ye
every
man
of
his
own
vine,
and
every
one
of
his
fig
tree,
and
drink
ye
every
one
the
waters
of
his
cistern:
018:032
Until
I
come
and
take
you
away
to
a
land
like
your
own
land,
a
land
of
corn
and
wine,
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards,
a
land
of
oil
olive
and
of
honey,
that
ye
may
live,
and
not
die:
and
hearken
not
unto
Hezekiah,
when
he
persuadeth
you,
saying,
The
LORD
will
deliver
us.
018:033
Hath
any
of
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
at
all
his
land
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria?
018:034
Where
are
the
gods
of
Hamath,
and
of
Arpad?
where
are
the
gods
of
Sepharvaim,
Hena,
and
Ivah?
have
they
delivered
Samaria
out
of
mine
hand?
018:035
Who
are
they
among
all
the
gods
of
the
countries,
that
have
delivered
their
country
out
of
mine
hand,
that
the
LORD
should
deliver
Jerusalem
out
of
mine
hand?
018:036
But
the
people
held
their
peace,
and
answered
him
not
a
word:
for
the
king's
commandment
was,
saying,
Answer
him
not.
018:037
Then
came
Eliakim
the
son
of
Hilkiah,
which
was
over
the
household,
and
Shebna
the
scribe,
and
Joah
the
son
of
Asaph
the
recorder,
to
Hezekiah
with
their
clothes
rent,
and
told
him
the
words
of
Rabshakeh.
019:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
king
Hezekiah
heard
it,
that
he
rent
his
clothes,
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth,
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
LORD.
019:002
And
he
sent
Eliakim,
which
was
over
the
household,
and
Shebna
the
scribe,
and
the
elders
of
the
priests,
covered
with
sackcloth,
to
Isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
Amoz.
019:003
And
they
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
Hezekiah,
This
day
is
a
day
of
trouble,
and
of
rebuke,
and
blasphemy;
for
the
children
are
come
to
the
birth,
and
there
is
not
strength
to
bring
forth.
019:004
It
may
be
the
LORD
thy
God
will
hear
all
the
words
of
Rabshakeh,
whom
the
king
of
Assyria
his
master
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
God;
and
will
reprove
the
