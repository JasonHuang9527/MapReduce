words
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
heard:
wherefore
lift
up
thy
prayer
for
the
remnant
that
are
left.
019:005
So
the
servants
of
king
Hezekiah
came
to
Isaiah.
019:006
And
Isaiah
said
unto
them,
Thus
shall
ye
say
to
your
master,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Be
not
afraid
of
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard,
with
which
the
servants
of
the
king
of
Assyria
have
blasphemed
me.
019:007
Behold,
I
will
send
a
blast
upon
him,
and
he
shall
hear
a
rumour,
and
shall
return
to
his
own
land;
and
I
will
cause
him
to
fall
by
the
sword
in
his
own
land.
019:008
So
Rabshakeh
returned,
and
found
the
king
of
Assyria
warring
against
Libnah:
for
he
had
heard
that
he
was
departed
from
Lachish.
019:009
And
when
he
heard
say
of
Tirhakah
king
of
Ethiopia,
Behold,
he
is
come
out
to
fight
against
thee:
he
sent
messengers
again
unto
Hezekiah,
saying,
019:010
Thus
shall
ye
speak
to
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah,
saying,
Let
not
thy
God
in
whom
thou
trustest
deceive
thee,
saying,
Jerusalem
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria.
019:011
Behold,
thou
hast
heard
what
the
kings
of
Assyria
have
done
to
all
lands,
by
destroying
them
utterly:
and
shalt
thou
be
delivered?
019:012
Have
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
them
which
my
fathers
have
destroyed;
as
Gozan,
and
Haran,
and
Rezeph,
and
the
children
of
Eden
which
were
in
Thelasar?
019:013
Where
is
the
king
of
Hamath,
and
the
king
of
Arpad,
and
the
king
of
the
city
of
Sepharvaim,
of
Hena,
and
Ivah?
019:014
And
Hezekiah
received
the
letter
of
the
hand
of
the
messengers,
and
read
it:
and
Hezekiah
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
spread
it
before
the
LORD.
019:015
And
Hezekiah
prayed
before
the
LORD,
and
said,
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
which
dwellest
between
the
cherubims,
thou
art
the
God,
even
thou
alone,
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth;
thou
hast
made
heaven
and
earth.
019:016
LORD,
bow
down
thine
ear,
and
hear:
open,
LORD,
thine
eyes,
and
see:
and
hear
the
words
of
Sennacherib,
which
hath
sent
him
to
reproach
the
living
God.
019:017
Of
a
truth,
LORD,
the
kings
of
Assyria
have
destroyed
the
nations
and
their
lands,
019:018
And
have
cast
their
gods
into
the
fire:
for
they
were
no
gods,
but
the
work
of
men's
hands,
wood
and
stone:
therefore
they
have
destroyed
them.
019:019
Now
therefore,
O
LORD
our
God,
I
beseech
thee,
save
thou
us
out
of
his
hand,
that
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
may
know
that
thou
art
the
LORD
God,
even
thou
only.
019:020
Then
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
sent
to
Hezekiah,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
That
which
thou
hast
prayed
to
me
against
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria
I
have
heard.
019:021
This
is
the
word
that
the
LORD
hath
spoken
concerning
him;
The
virgin
the
daughter
of
Zion
hath
despised
thee,
and
laughed
thee
to
scorn;
the
daughter
of
Jerusalem
hath
shaken
her
head
at
thee.
019:022
Whom
hast
thou
reproached
and
blasphemed?
and
against
whom
hast
thou
exalted
thy
voice,
and
lifted
up
thine
eyes
on
high?
even
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel.
019:023
By
thy
messengers
thou
hast
reproached
the
LORD,
and
hast
said,
With
the
multitude
of
my
chariots
I
am
come
up
to
the
height
of
the
mountains,
to
the
sides
of
Lebanon,
and
will
cut
down
the
tall
cedar
trees
thereof,
and
the
choice
fir
trees
thereof:
and
I
will
enter
into
the
lodgings
of
his
borders,
and
into
the
forest
of
his
Carmel.
019:024
I
have
digged
and
drunk
strange
waters,
and
with
the
sole
of
my
feet
have
I
dried
up
all
the
rivers
of
besieged
places.
019:025
Hast
thou
not
heard
long
ago
how
I
have
done
it,
and
of
ancient
times
that
I
have
formed
it?
now
have
I
brought
it
to
pass,
that
thou
shouldest
be
to
lay
waste
fenced
cities
into
ruinous
heaps.
019:026
Therefore
their
inhabitants
were
of
small
power,
they
were
dismayed
and
confounded;
they
were
as
the
grass
of
the
field,
and
as
the
green
herb,
as
the
grass
on
the
house
tops,
and
as
corn
blasted
before
it
be
grown
up.
019:027
But
I
know
thy
abode,
and
thy
going
out,
and
thy
coming
in,
and
thy
rage
against
me.
019:028
Because
thy
rage
against
me
and
thy
tumult
is
come
up
into
mine
ears,
therefore
I
will
put
my
hook
in
thy
nose,
and
my
bridle
in
thy
lips,
and
I
will
turn
thee
back
by
the
way
by
which
thou
camest.
019:029
And
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee,
Ye
shall
eat
this
year
such
things
as
grow
of
themselves,
and
in
the
second
year
that
which
springeth
of
the
same;
and
in
the
third
year
sow
ye,
and
reap,
and
plant
vineyards,
and
eat
the
fruits
thereof.
019:030
And
the
remnant
that
is
escaped
of
the
house
of
Judah
shall
yet
again
take
root
downward,
and
bear
fruit
upward.
019:031
For
out
of
Jerusalem
shall
go
forth
a
remnant,
and
they
that
escape
out
of
mount
Zion:
the
zeal
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
shall
do
this.
019:032
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
concerning
the
king
of
Assyria,
He
shall
not
come
into
this
city,
nor
shoot
an
arrow
there,
nor
come
before
it
with
shield,
nor
cast
a
bank
against
it.
019:033
By
the
way
that
he
came,
by
the
same
shall
he
return,
and
shall
not
come
into
this
city,
saith
the
LORD.
019:034
For
I
will
defend
this
city,
to
save
it,
for
mine
own
sake,
and
for
my
servant
David's
sake.
019:035
And
it
came
to
pass
that
night,
that
the
angel
of
the
LORD
went
out,
and
smote
in
the
camp
of
the
Assyrians
an
hundred
fourscore
and
five
thousand:
and
when
they
arose
early
in
the
morning,
behold,
they
were
all
dead
corpses.
019:036
So
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria
departed,
and
went
and
returned,
and
dwelt
at
Nineveh.
019:037
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
was
worshipping
in
the
house
of
Nisroch
his
god,
that
Adrammelech
and
Sharezer
his
sons
smote
him
with
the
sword:
and
they
escaped
into
the
land
of
Armenia.
And
Esarhaddon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
020:001
In
those
days
was
Hezekiah
sick
unto
death.
And
the
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
came
to
him,
and
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Set
thine
house
in
order;
for
thou
shalt
die,
and
not
live.
020:002
Then
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall,
and
prayed
unto
the
LORD,
saying,
020:003
I
beseech
thee,
O
LORD,
remember
now
how
I
have
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
with
a
perfect
heart,
and
have
done
that
which
is
good
in
thy
sight.
And
Hezekiah
wept
sore.
020:004
And
it
came
to
pass,
afore
Isaiah
was
gone
out
into
the
middle
court,
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
him,
saying,
020:005
Turn
again,
and
tell
Hezekiah
the
captain
of
my
people,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
the
God
of
David
thy
father,
I
have
heard
thy
prayer,
I
have
seen
thy
tears:
behold,
I
will
heal
thee:
on
the
third
day
thou
shalt
go
up
unto
the
house
of
the
LORD.
020:006
And
I
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years;
and
I
will
deliver
thee
and
this
city
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria;
and
I
will
defend
this
city
for
mine
own
sake,
and
for
my
servant
David's
sake.
020:007
And
Isaiah
said,
Take
a
lump
of
figs.
And
they
took
and
laid
it
on
the
boil,
and
he
recovered.
020:008
And
Hezekiah
said
unto
Isaiah,
What
shall
be
the
sign
that
the
LORD
will
heal
me,
and
that
I
shall
go
up
into
the
house
of
the
LORD
the
third
day?
020:009
And
Isaiah
said,
This
sign
shalt
thou
have
of
the
LORD,
that
the
LORD
will
do
the
thing
that
he
hath
spoken:
shall
the
shadow
go
forward
ten
degrees,
or
go
back
ten
degrees?
020:010
And
Hezekiah
answered,
It
is
a
light
thing
for
the
shadow
to
go
down
ten
degrees:
nay,
but
let
the
shadow
return
backward
ten
degrees.
020:011
And
Isaiah
the
prophet
cried
unto
the
LORD:
and
he
brought
the
shadow
ten
degrees
backward,
by
which
it
had
gone
down
in
the
dial
of
Ahaz.
020:012
At
that
time
Berodachbaladan,
the
son
of
Baladan,
king
of
Babylon,
sent
letters
and
a
present
unto
Hezekiah:
for
he
had
heard
that
Hezekiah
had
been
sick.
020:013
And
Hezekiah
hearkened
unto
them,
and
shewed
them
all
the
house
of
his
precious
things,
the
silver,
and
the
gold,
and
the
spices,
and
the
precious
ointment,
and
all
the
house
of
his
armour,
and
all
that
was
found
in
his
treasures:
there
was
nothing
in
his
house,
nor
in
all
his
dominion,
that
Hezekiah
shewed
them
not.
020:014
Then
came
Isaiah
the
prophet
unto
king
Hezekiah,
and
said
unto
him,
What
said
these
men?
and
from
whence
came
they
unto
thee?
And
Hezekiah
said,
They
are
come
from
a
far
country,
even
from
Babylon.
020:015
And
he
said,
What
have
they
seen
in
thine
house?
And
Hezekiah
answered,
All
the
things
that
are
in
mine
house
have
they
seen:
there
is
nothing
among
my
treasures
that
I
have
not
shewed
them.
020:016
And
Isaiah
said
unto
Hezekiah,
Hear
the
word
of
the
LORD.
020:017
Behold,
the
days
come,
that
all
that
is
in
thine
house,
and
that
which
thy
fathers
have
laid
up
in
store
unto
this
day,
shall
be
carried
into
Babylon:
nothing
shall
be
left,
saith
the
LORD.
020:018
And
of
thy
sons
that
shall
issue
from
thee,
which
thou
shalt
beget,
shall
they
take
away;
and
they
shall
be
eunuchs
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
Babylon.
020:019
Then
said
Hezekiah
unto
Isaiah,
Good
is
the
word
of
the
LORD
which
thou
hast
spoken.
And
he
said,
Is
it
not
good,
if
peace
and
truth
be
in
my
days?
020:020
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Hezekiah,
and
all
his
might,
and
how
he
made
a
pool,
and
a
conduit,
and
brought
water
into
the
city,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
020:021
And
Hezekiah
slept
with
his
fathers:
and
Manasseh
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
021:001
Manasseh
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
reigned
fifty
and
five
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Hephzibah.
021:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
after
the
abominations
of
the
heathen,
whom
the
LORD
cast
out
before
the
children
of
Israel.
021:003
For
he
built
up
again
the
high
places
which
Hezekiah
his
father
had
destroyed;
and
he
reared
up
altars
for
Baal,
and
made
a
grove,
as
did
Ahab
king
of
Israel;
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven,
and
served
them.
021:004
And
he
built
altars
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
of
which
the
LORD
said,
In
Jerusalem
will
I
put
my
name.
021:005
And
he
built
altars
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
021:006
And
he
made
his
son
pass
through
the
fire,
and
observed
times,
and
used
enchantments,
and
dealt
with
familiar
spirits
and
wizards:
he
wrought
much
wickedness
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
to
provoke
him
to
anger.
021:007
And
he
set
a
graven
image
of
the
grove
that
he
had
made
in
the
house,
of
which
the
LORD
said
to
David,
and
to
Solomon
his
son,
In
this
house,
and
in
Jerusalem,
which
I
have
chosen
out
of
all
tribes
of
Israel,
will
I
put
my
name
for
ever:
021:008
Neither
will
I
make
the
feet
of
Israel
move
any
more
out
of
the
land
which
I
gave
their
fathers;
only
if
they
will
observe
to
do
according
to
all
that
I
have
commanded
them,
and
according
to
all
the
law
that
my
servant
Moses
commanded
them.
021:009
But
they
hearkened
not:
and
Manasseh
seduced
them
to
do
more
evil
than
did
the
nations
whom
the
LORD
destroyed
before
the
children
of
Israel.
021:010
And
the
LORD
spake
by
his
servants
the
prophets,
saying,
021:011
Because
Manasseh
king
of
Judah
hath
done
these
abominations,
and
hath
done
wickedly
above
all
that
the
Amorites
did,
which
were
before
him,
and
hath
made
Judah
also
to
sin
with
his
idols:
021:012
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Behold,
I
am
bringing
such
evil
upon
Jerusalem
and
Judah,
that
whosoever
heareth
of
it,
both
his
ears
shall
tingle.
021:013
And
I
will
stretch
over
Jerusalem
the
line
of
Samaria,
and
the
plummet
of
the
house
of
Ahab:
and
I
will
wipe
Jerusalem
as
a
man
wipeth
a
dish,
wiping
it,
and
turning
it
upside
down.
021:014
And
I
will
forsake
the
remnant
of
mine
inheritance,
and
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies;
and
they
shall
become
a
prey
and
a
spoil
to
all
their
enemies;
021:015
Because
they
have
done
that
which
was
evil
in
my
sight,
and
have
provoked
me
to
anger,
since
the
day
their
fathers
came
forth
out
of
Egypt,
even
unto
this
day.
021:016
Moreover
Manasseh
shed
innocent
blood
very
much,
till
he
had
filled
Jerusalem
from
one
end
to
another;
beside
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
Judah
to
sin,
in
doing
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD.
021:017
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Manasseh,
and
all
that
he
did,
and
his
sin
that
he
sinned,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
021:018
And
Manasseh
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
in
the
garden
of
his
own
house,
in
the
garden
of
Uzza:
and
Amon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
021:019
Amon
was
twenty
and
two
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
two
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Meshullemeth,
the
daughter
of
Haruz
of
Jotbah.
021:020
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
as
his
father
Manasseh
did.
021:021
And
he
walked
in
all
the
way
that
his
father
walked
in,
and
served
the
idols
that
his
father
served,
and
worshipped
them:
021:022
And
he
forsook
the
LORD
God
of
his
fathers,
and
walked
not
in
the
way
of
the
LORD.
021:023
And
the
servants
of
Amon
conspired
against
him,
and
slew
the
king
in
his
own
house.
021:024
And
the
people
of
the
land
slew
all
them
that
had
conspired
against
king
Amon;
and
the
people
of
the
land
made
Josiah
his
son
king
in
his
stead.
021:025
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Amon
which
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
021:026
And
he
was
buried
in
his
sepulchre
in
the
garden
of
Uzza:
and
Josiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
022:001
Josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
thirty
and
one
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Jedidah,
the
daughter
of
Adaiah
of
Boscath.
022:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
walked
in
all
the
way
of
David
his
father,
and
turned
not
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left.
022:003
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
Josiah,
that
the
king
sent
Shaphan
the
son
of
Azaliah,
the
son
of
Meshullam,
the
scribe,
to
the
house
of
the
LORD,
saying,
022:004
Go
up
to
Hilkiah
the
high
priest,
that
he
may
sum
the
silver
which
is
brought
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
which
the
keepers
of
the
door
have
gathered
of
the
people:
022:005
And
let
them
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
doers
of
the
work,
that
have
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
LORD:
and
let
them
give
it
to
the
doers
of
the
work
which
is
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house,
022:006
Unto
carpenters,
and
builders,
and
masons,
and
to
buy
timber
and
hewn
stone
to
repair
the
house.
022:007
Howbeit
there
was
no
reckoning
made
with
them
of
the
money
that
was
delivered
into
their
hand,
because
they
dealt
faithfully.
022:008
And
Hilkiah
the
high
priest
said
unto
Shaphan
the
scribe,
I
have
found
the
book
of
the
law
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
And
Hilkiah
gave
the
book
to
Shaphan,
and
he
read
it.
022:009
And
Shaphan
the
scribe
came
to
the
king,
and
brought
the
king
word
again,
and
said,
Thy
servants
have
gathered
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house,
and
have
delivered
it
into
the
hand
of
them
that
do
the
work,
that
have
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
022:010
And
Shaphan
the
scribe
shewed
the
king,
saying,
Hilkiah
the
priest
hath
delivered
me
a
book.
And
Shaphan
read
it
before
the
king.
022:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
king
had
heard
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
law,
that
he
rent
his
clothes.
022:012
And
the
king
commanded
Hilkiah
the
priest,
and
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan,
and
Achbor
the
son
of
Michaiah,
and
Shaphan
the
scribe,
and
Asahiah
a
servant
of
the
king's,
saying,
022:013
Go
ye,
enquire
of
the
LORD
for
me,
and
for
the
people,
and
for
all
Judah,
concerning
the
words
of
this
book
that
is
found:
for
great
is
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
that
is
kindled
against
us,
because
our
fathers
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
this
book,
to
do
according
unto
all
that
which
is
written
concerning
us.
022:014
So
Hilkiah
the
priest,
and
Ahikam,
and
Achbor,
and
Shaphan,
and
Asahiah,
went
unto
Huldah
the
prophetess,
the
wife
of
Shallum
the
son
of
Tikvah,
the
son
of
Harhas,
keeper
of
the
wardrobe;
(now
she
dwelt
in
Jerusalem
in
the
college;)
and
they
communed
with
her.
022:015
And
she
said
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Tell
the
man
that
sent
you
to
me,
022:016
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place,
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof,
even
all
the
words
of
the
book
which
the
king
of
Judah
hath
read:
022:017
Because
they
have
forsaken
me,
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods,
that
they
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
all
the
works
of
their
hands;
therefore
my
wrath
shall
be
kindled
against
this
place,
and
shall
not
be
quenched.
022:018
But
to
the
king
of
Judah
which
sent
you
to
enquire
of
the
LORD,
thus
shall
ye
say
to
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
As
touching
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard;
022:019
Because
thine
heart
was
tender,
and
thou
hast
humbled
thyself
before
the
LORD,
when
thou
heardest
what
I
spake
against
this
place,
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof,
that
they
should
become
a
desolation
and
a
curse,
and
hast
rent
thy
clothes,
and
wept
before
me;
I
also
have
heard
thee,
saith
the
LORD.
022:020
Behold
therefore,
I
will
gather
thee
unto
thy
fathers,
and
thou
shalt
be
gathered
into
thy
grave
in
peace;
and
thine
eyes
shall
not
see
all
the
evil
which
I
will
bring
upon
this
place.
And
they
brought
the
king
word
again.
023:001
And
the
king
sent,
and
they
gathered
unto
him
all
the
elders
of
Judah
and
of
Jerusalem.
023:002
And
the
king
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
all
the
men
of
Judah
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
with
him,
and
the
priests,
and
the
prophets,
and
all
the
people,
both
small
and
great:
and
he
read
in
their
ears
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
which
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
023:003
And
the
king
stood
by
a
pillar,
and
made
a
covenant
before
the
LORD,
to
walk
after
the
LORD,
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
testimonies
and
his
statutes
with
all
their
heart
and
all
their
soul,
to
perform
the
words
of
this
covenant
that
were
written
in
this
book.
And
all
the
people
stood
to
the
covenant.
023:004
And
the
king
commanded
Hilkiah
the
high
priest,
and
the
priests
of
the
second
order,
and
the
keepers
of
the
door,
to
bring
forth
out
of
the
temple
of
the
LORD
all
the
vessels
that
were
made
for
Baal,
and
for
the
grove,
and
for
all
the
host
of
heaven:
and
he
burned
them
without
Jerusalem
in
the
fields
of
Kidron,
and
carried
the
ashes
of
them
unto
Bethel.
023:005
And
he
put
down
the
idolatrous
priests,
whom
the
kings
of
Judah
had
ordained
to
burn
incense
in
the
high
places
in
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
in
the
places
round
about
Jerusalem;
them
also
that
burned
incense
unto
Baal,
to
the
sun,
and
to
the
moon,
and
to
the
planets,
and
to
all
the
host
of
heaven.
023:006
And
he
brought
out
the
grove
from
the
house
of
the
LORD,
without
Jerusalem,
unto
the
brook
Kidron,
and
burned
it
at
the
brook
Kidron,
and
stamped
it
small
to
powder,
and
cast
the
powder
thereof
upon
the
graves
of
the
children
of
the
people.
023:007
And
he
brake
down
the
houses
of
the
sodomites,
that
were
by
the
house
of
the
LORD,
where
the
women
wove
hangings
for
the
grove.
023:008
And
he
brought
all
the
priests
out
of
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
defiled
the
high
places
where
the
priests
had
burned
incense,
from
Geba
to
Beersheba,
and
brake
down
the
high
places
of
the
gates
that
were
in
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
of
Joshua
the
governor
of
the
city,
which
were
on
a
man's
left
hand
at
the
gate
of
the
city.
023:009
Nevertheless
the
priests
of
the
high
places
came
not
up
to
the
altar
of
the
LORD
in
Jerusalem,
but
they
did
eat
of
the
unleavened
bread
among
their
brethren.
023:010
And
he
defiled
Topheth,
which
is
in
the
valley
of
the
children
of
Hinnom,
that
no
man
might
make
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
to
Molech.
023:011
And
he
took
away
the
horses
that
the
kings
of
Judah
had
given
to
the
sun,
at
the
entering
in
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
by
the
chamber
of
Nathanmelech
the
chamberlain,
which
was
in
the
suburbs,
and
burned
the
chariots
of
the
sun
with
fire.
023:012
And
the
altars
that
were
on
the
top
of
the
upper
chamber
of
Ahaz,
which
the
kings
of
Judah
had
made,
and
the
altars
which
Manasseh
had
made
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
did
the
king
beat
down,
and
brake
them
down
from
thence,
and
cast
the
dust
of
them
into
the
brook
Kidron.
023:013
And
the
high
places
that
were
before
Jerusalem,
which
were
on
the
right
hand
of
the
mount
of
corruption,
which
Solomon
the
king
of
Israel
had
builded
for
Ashtoreth
the
abomination
of
the
Zidonians,
and
for
Chemosh
the
abomination
of
the
Moabites,
and
for
Milcom
the
abomination
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
did
the
king
defile.
023:014
And
he
brake
in
pieces
the
images,
and
cut
down
the
groves,
and
filled
their
places
with
the
bones
of
men.
023:015
Moreover
the
altar
that
was
at
Bethel,
and
the
high
place
which
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
made
Israel
to
sin,
had
made,
both
that
altar
and
the
high
place
he
brake
down,
and
burned
the
high
place,
and
stamped
it
small
to
powder,
and
burned
the
grove.
023:016
And
as
Josiah
turned
himself,
he
spied
the
sepulchres
that
were
there
in
the
mount,
and
sent,
and
took
the
bones
out
of
the
sepulchres,
and
burned
them
upon
the
altar,
and
polluted
it,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
which
the
man
of
God
proclaimed,
who
proclaimed
these
words.
023:017
Then
he
said,
What
title
is
that
that
I
see?
And
the
men
of
the
city
told
him,
It
is
the
sepulchre
of
the
man
of
God,
which
came
from
Judah,
and
proclaimed
these
things
that
thou
hast
done
against
the
altar
of
Bethel.
023:018
And
he
said,
Let
him
alone;
let
no
man
move
his
bones.
So
they
let
his
bones
alone,
with
the
bones
of
the
prophet
that
came
out
of
Samaria.
023:019
And
all
the
houses
also
of
the
high
places
that
were
in
the
cities
of
Samaria,
which
the
kings
