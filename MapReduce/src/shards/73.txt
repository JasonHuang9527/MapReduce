of
Israel
had
made
to
provoke
the
Lord
to
anger,
Josiah
took
away,
and
did
to
them
according
to
all
the
acts
that
he
had
done
in
Bethel.
023:020
And
he
slew
all
the
priests
of
the
high
places
that
were
there
upon
the
altars,
and
burned
men's
bones
upon
them,
and
returned
to
Jerusalem.
023:021
And
the
king
commanded
all
the
people,
saying,
Keep
the
passover
unto
the
LORD
your
God,
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
this
covenant.
023:022
Surely
there
was
not
holden
such
a
passover
from
the
days
of
the
judges
that
judged
Israel,
nor
in
all
the
days
of
the
kings
of
Israel,
nor
of
the
kings
of
Judah;
023:023
But
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
Josiah,
wherein
this
passover
was
holden
to
the
LORD
in
Jerusalem.
023:024
Moreover
the
workers
with
familiar
spirits,
and
the
wizards,
and
the
images,
and
the
idols,
and
all
the
abominations
that
were
spied
in
the
land
of
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem,
did
Josiah
put
away,
that
he
might
perform
the
words
of
the
law
which
were
written
in
the
book
that
Hilkiah
the
priest
found
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
023:025
And
like
unto
him
was
there
no
king
before
him,
that
turned
to
the
LORD
with
all
his
heart,
and
with
all
his
soul,
and
with
all
his
might,
according
to
all
the
law
of
Moses;
neither
after
him
arose
there
any
like
him.
023:026
Notwithstanding
the
LORD
turned
not
from
the
fierceness
of
his
great
wrath,
wherewith
his
anger
was
kindled
against
Judah,
because
of
all
the
provocations
that
Manasseh
had
provoked
him
withal.
023:027
And
the
LORD
said,
I
will
remove
Judah
also
out
of
my
sight,
as
I
have
removed
Israel,
and
will
cast
off
this
city
Jerusalem
which
I
have
chosen,
and
the
house
of
which
I
said,
My
name
shall
be
there.
023:028
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Josiah,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
023:029
In
his
days
Pharaohnechoh
king
of
Egypt
went
up
against
the
king
of
Assyria
to
the
river
Euphrates:
and
king
Josiah
went
against
him;
and
he
slew
him
at
Megiddo,
when
he
had
seen
him.
023:030
And
his
servants
carried
him
in
a
chariot
dead
from
Megiddo,
and
brought
him
to
Jerusalem,
and
buried
him
in
his
own
sepulchre.
And
the
people
of
the
land
took
Jehoahaz
the
son
of
Josiah,
and
anointed
him,
and
made
him
king
in
his
father's
stead.
023:031
Jehoahaz
was
twenty
and
three
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign;
and
he
reigned
three
months
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Hamutal,
the
daughter
of
Jeremiah
of
Libnah.
023:032
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
his
fathers
had
done.
023:033
And
Pharaohnechoh
put
him
in
bands
at
Riblah
in
the
land
of
Hamath,
that
he
might
not
reign
in
Jerusalem;
and
put
the
land
to
a
tribute
of
an
hundred
talents
of
silver,
and
a
talent
of
gold.
023:034
And
Pharaohnechoh
made
Eliakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
in
the
room
of
Josiah
his
father,
and
turned
his
name
to
Jehoiakim,
and
took
Jehoahaz
away:
and
he
came
to
Egypt,
and
died
there.
023:035
And
Jehoiakim
gave
the
silver
and
the
gold
to
Pharaoh;
but
he
taxed
the
land
to
give
the
money
according
to
the
commandment
of
Pharaoh:
he
exacted
the
silver
and
the
gold
of
the
people
of
the
land,
of
every
one
according
to
his
taxation,
to
give
it
unto
Pharaohnechoh.
023:036
Jehoiakim
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign;
and
he
reigned
eleven
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Zebudah,
the
daughter
of
Pedaiah
of
Rumah.
023:037
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
his
fathers
had
done.
024:001
In
his
days
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
came
up,
and
Jehoiakim
became
his
servant
three
years:
then
he
turned
and
rebelled
against
him.
024:002
And
the
LORD
sent
against
him
bands
of
the
Chaldees,
and
bands
of
the
Syrians,
and
bands
of
the
Moabites,
and
bands
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
sent
them
against
Judah
to
destroy
it,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
he
spake
by
his
servants
the
prophets.
024:003
Surely
at
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
came
this
upon
Judah,
to
remove
them
out
of
his
sight,
for
the
sins
of
Manasseh,
according
to
all
that
he
did;
024:004
And
also
for
the
innocent
blood
that
he
shed:
for
he
filled
Jerusalem
with
innocent
blood;
which
the
LORD
would
not
pardon.
024:005
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jehoiakim,
and
all
that
he
did,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Judah?
024:006
So
Jehoiakim
slept
with
his
fathers:
and
Jehoiachin
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
024:007
And
the
king
of
Egypt
came
not
again
any
more
out
of
his
land:
for
the
king
of
Babylon
had
taken
from
the
river
of
Egypt
unto
the
river
Euphrates
all
that
pertained
to
the
king
of
Egypt.
024:008
Jehoiachin
was
eighteen
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
in
Jerusalem
three
months.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Nehushta,
the
daughter
of
Elnathan
of
Jerusalem.
024:009
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
his
father
had
done.
024:010
At
that
time
the
servants
of
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
came
up
against
Jerusalem,
and
the
city
was
besieged.
024:011
And
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
came
against
the
city,
and
his
servants
did
besiege
it.
024:012
And
Jehoiachin
the
king
of
Judah
went
out
to
the
king
of
Babylon,
he,
and
his
mother,
and
his
servants,
and
his
princes,
and
his
officers:
and
the
king
of
Babylon
took
him
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
reign.
024:013
And
he
carried
out
thence
all
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house,
and
cut
in
pieces
all
the
vessels
of
gold
which
Solomon
king
of
Israel
had
made
in
the
temple
of
the
LORD,
as
the
LORD
had
said.
024:014
And
he
carried
away
all
Jerusalem,
and
all
the
princes,
and
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour,
even
ten
thousand
captives,
and
all
the
craftsmen
and
smiths:
none
remained,
save
the
poorest
sort
of
the
people
of
the
land.
024:015
And
he
carried
away
Jehoiachin
to
Babylon,
and
the
king's
mother,
and
the
king's
wives,
and
his
officers,
and
the
mighty
of
the
land,
those
carried
he
into
captivity
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon.
024:016
And
all
the
men
of
might,
even
seven
thousand,
and
craftsmen
and
smiths
a
thousand,
all
that
were
strong
and
apt
for
war,
even
them
the
king
of
Babylon
brought
captive
to
Babylon.
024:017
And
the
king
of
Babylon
made
Mattaniah
his
father's
brother
king
in
his
stead,
and
changed
his
name
to
Zedekiah.
024:018
Zedekiah
was
twenty
and
one
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
eleven
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Hamutal,
the
daughter
of
Jeremiah
of
Libnah.
024:019
And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
Jehoiakim
had
done.
024:020
For
through
the
anger
of
the
LORD
it
came
to
pass
in
Jerusalem
and
Judah,
until
he
had
cast
them
out
from
his
presence,
that
Zedekiah
rebelled
against
the
king
of
Babylon.
025:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
ninth
year
of
his
reign,
in
the
tenth
month,
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month,
that
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
came,
he,
and
all
his
host,
against
Jerusalem,
and
pitched
against
it;
and
they
built
forts
against
it
round
about.
025:002
And
the
city
was
besieged
unto
the
eleventh
year
of
king
Zedekiah.
025:003
And
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
fourth
month
the
famine
prevailed
in
the
city,
and
there
was
no
bread
for
the
people
of
the
land.
025:004
And
the
city
was
broken
up,
and
all
the
men
of
war
fled
by
night
by
the
way
of
the
gate
between
two
walls,
which
is
by
the
king's
garden:
(now
the
Chaldees
were
against
the
city
round
about:)
and
the
king
went
the
way
toward
the
plain.
025:005
And
the
army
of
the
Chaldees
pursued
after
the
king,
and
overtook
him
in
the
plains
of
Jericho:
and
all
his
army
were
scattered
from
him.
025:006
So
they
took
the
king,
and
brought
him
up
to
the
king
of
Babylon
to
Riblah;
and
they
gave
judgment
upon
him.
025:007
And
they
slew
the
sons
of
Zedekiah
before
his
eyes,
and
put
out
the
eyes
of
Zedekiah,
and
bound
him
with
fetters
of
brass,
and
carried
him
to
Babylon.
025:008
And
in
the
fifth
month,
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
month,
which
is
the
nineteenth
year
of
king
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon,
came
Nebuzaradan,
captain
of
the
guard,
a
servant
of
the
king
of
Babylon,
unto
Jerusalem:
025:009
And
he
burnt
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
king's
house,
and
all
the
houses
of
Jerusalem,
and
every
great
man's
house
burnt
he
with
fire.
025:010
And
all
the
army
of
the
Chaldees,
that
were
with
the
captain
of
the
guard,
brake
down
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
round
about.
025:011
Now
the
rest
of
the
people
that
were
left
in
the
city,
and
the
fugitives
that
fell
away
to
the
king
of
Babylon,
with
the
remnant
of
the
multitude,
did
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
carry
away.
025:012
But
the
captain
of
the
guard
left
of
the
door
of
the
poor
of
the
land
to
be
vinedressers
and
husbandmen.
025:013
And
the
pillars
of
brass
that
were
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
bases,
and
the
brasen
sea
that
was
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
did
the
Chaldees
break
in
pieces,
and
carried
the
brass
of
them
to
Babylon.
025:014
And
the
pots,
and
the
shovels,
and
the
snuffers,
and
the
spoons,
and
all
the
vessels
of
brass
wherewith
they
ministered,
took
they
away.
025:015
And
the
firepans,
and
the
bowls,
and
such
things
as
were
of
gold,
in
gold,
and
of
silver,
in
silver,
the
captain
of
the
guard
took
away.
025:016
The
two
pillars,
one
sea,
and
the
bases
which
Solomon
had
made
for
the
house
of
the
LORD;
the
brass
of
all
these
vessels
was
without
weight.
025:017
The
height
of
the
one
pillar
was
eighteen
cubits,
and
the
chapiter
upon
it
was
brass:
and
the
height
of
the
chapiter
three
cubits;
and
the
wreathen
work,
and
pomegranates
upon
the
chapiter
round
about,
all
of
brass:
and
like
unto
these
had
the
second
pillar
with
wreathen
work.
025:018
And
the
captain
of
the
guard
took
Seraiah
the
chief
priest,
and
Zephaniah
the
second
priest,
and
the
three
keepers
of
the
door:
025:019
And
out
of
the
city
he
took
an
officer
that
was
set
over
the
men
of
war,
and
five
men
of
them
that
were
in
the
king's
presence,
which
were
found
in
the
city,
and
the
principal
scribe
of
the
host,
which
mustered
the
people
of
the
land,
and
threescore
men
of
the
people
of
the
land
that
were
found
in
the
city:
025:020
And
Nebuzaradan
captain
of
the
guard
took
these,
and
brought
them
to
the
king
of
Babylon
to
Riblah:
025:021
And
the
king
of
Babylon
smote
them,
and
slew
them
at
Riblah
in
the
land
of
Hamath.
So
Judah
was
carried
away
out
of
their
land.
025:022
And
as
for
the
people
that
remained
in
the
land
of
Judah,
whom
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
had
left,
even
over
them
he
made
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam,
the
son
of
Shaphan,
ruler.
025:023
And
when
all
the
captains
of
the
armies,
they
and
their
men,
heard
that
the
king
of
Babylon
had
made
Gedaliah
governor,
there
came
to
Gedaliah
to
Mizpah,
even
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah,
and
Johanan
the
son
of
Careah,
and
Seraiah
the
son
of
Tanhumeth
the
Netophathite,
and
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
a
Maachathite,
they
and
their
men.
025:024
And
Gedaliah
sware
to
them,
and
to
their
men,
and
said
unto
them,
Fear
not
to
be
the
servants
of
the
Chaldees:
dwell
in
the
land,
and
serve
the
king
of
Babylon;
and
it
shall
be
well
with
you.
025:025
But
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
month,
that
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah,
the
son
of
Elishama,
of
the
seed
royal,
came,
and
ten
men
with
him,
and
smote
Gedaliah,
that
he
died,
and
the
Jews
and
the
Chaldees
that
were
with
him
at
Mizpah.
025:026
And
all
the
people,
both
small
and
great,
and
the
captains
of
the
armies,
arose,
and
came
to
Egypt:
for
they
were
afraid
of
the
Chaldees.
025:027
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seven
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
captivity
of
Jehoiachin
king
of
Judah,
in
the
twelfth
month,
on
the
seven
and
twentieth
day
of
the
month,
that
Evilmerodach
king
of
Babylon
in
the
year
that
he
began
to
reign
did
lift
up
the
head
of
Jehoiachin
king
of
Judah
out
of
prison;
025:028
And
he
spake
kindly
to
him,
and
set
his
throne
above
the
throne
of
the
kings
that
were
with
him
in
Babylon;
025:029
And
changed
his
prison
garments:
and
he
did
eat
bread
continually
before
him
all
the
days
of
his
life.
025:030
And
his
allowance
was
a
continual
allowance
given
him
of
the
king,
a
daily
rate
for
every
day,
all
the
days
of
his
life.
