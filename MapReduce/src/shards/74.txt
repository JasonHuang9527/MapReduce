who
had

And
these
are
ancient
things.
004:023
These
were
the
potters,
and
those
that
dwelt
among
plants
and
hedges:
there
they
dwelt
with
the
king
for
his
work.
004:024
The
sons
of
Simeon
were,
Nemuel,
and
Jamin,
Jarib,
Zerah,
and
Shaul:
004:025
Shallum
his
son,
Mibsam
his
son,

his
son.
004:026
And
the
sons
of
Mishma;
Hamuel
his
son,
Zacchur
his
son,
Shimei
his
son.
004:027
And
Shimei
had
sixteen
sons
and
six
daughters:
but
his
brethren
had
not
many
children,
neither
did
all
their
family
multiply,
like
to
the
children
of
Judah.
004:028
And
they
dwelt
at
Beersheba,
and
Moladah,
and
Hazarshual,
004:029
And
at
Bilhah,
and
at
Ezem,
and
at
Tolad,
004:030
And
at
Bethuel,
and
at
Hormah,
and
at
Ziklag,
004:031
And
at
Bethmarcaboth,
and
Hazarsusim,
and
at
Bethbirei,
and
at
Shaaraim.
These
were
their
cities
unto
the
reign
of
David.
004:032
And
their
villages
were,
Etam,
and
Ain,
Rimmon,
and
Tochen,
and
Ashan,
five
cities:
004:033
And
all
their
villages
that
were
round
about
the
same
cities,
unto
Baal.
These
were
their
habitations,
and
their
genealogy.
004:034
And
Meshobab,
and
Jamlech,
and
Joshah,
the
son
of
Amaziah,
004:035
And
Joel,
and
Jehu
the
son
of
Josibiah,
the
son
of
Seraiah,
the
son
of
Asiel,
004:036
And
Elioenai,
and
Jaakobah,
and
Jeshohaiah,
and
Asaiah,
and
Adiel,
and
Jesimiel,
and
Benaiah,
004:037
And
Ziza
the
son
of
Shiphi,
the
son
of
Allon,
the
son
of
Jedaiah,
the
son
of
Shimri,
the
son
of
Shemaiah;
004:038
These
mentioned
by
their
names
were
princes
in
their
families:
and
the
house
of
their
fathers
increased
greatly.
004:039
And
they
went
to
the
entrance
of
Gedor,
even
unto
the
east
side
of
the
valley,
to
seek
pasture
for
their
flocks.
004:040
And
they
found
fat
pasture
and
good,
and
the
land
was
wide,
and
quiet,
and
peaceable;
for
they
of
Ham
had
dwelt
there
of
old.
004:041
And
these
written
by
name
came
in
the
days
of
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah,
and
smote
their
tents,
and
the
habitations
that
were
found
there,
and
destroyed
them
utterly
unto
this
day,
and
dwelt
in
their
rooms:
because
there
was
pasture
there
for
their
flocks.
004:042
And
some
of
them,
even
of
the
sons
of
Simeon,
five
hundred
men,
went
to
mount
Seir,
having
for
their
captains
Pelatiah,
and
Neariah,
and
Rephaiah,
and
Uzziel,
the
sons
of
Ishi.
004:043
And
they
smote
the
rest
of
the
Amalekites
that
were
escaped,
and
dwelt
there
unto
this
day.
005:001
Now
the
sons
of
Reuben
the
firstborn
of
Israel,
(for
he
was
the
firstborn;
but
forasmuch
as
he
defiled
his
father's
bed,
his
birthright
was
given
unto
the
sons
of
Joseph
the
son
of
Israel:
and
the
genealogy
is
not
to
be
reckoned
after
the
birthright.
005:002
For
Judah
prevailed
above
his
brethren,
and
of
him
came
the
chief
ruler;
but
the
birthright
was
Joseph's:)
005:003
The
sons,
I
say,
of
Reuben
the
firstborn
of
Israel
were,
Hanoch,
and
Pallu,
Hezron,
and
Carmi.
005:004
The
sons
of
Joel;
Shemaiah
his
son,
Gog
his
son,
Shimei
his
son,
005:005
Micah
his
son,
Reaia
his
son,
Baal
his
son,
005:006
Beerah
his
son,
whom
Tilgathpilneser
king
of
Assyria
carried
away
captive:
he
was
prince
of
the
Reubenites.
005:007
And
his
brethren
by
their
families,
when
the
genealogy
of
their
generations
was
reckoned,
were
the
chief,
Jeiel,
and
Zechariah,
005:008
And
Bela
the
son
of
Azaz,
the
son
of
Shema,
the
son
of
Joel,
who
dwelt
in
Aroer,
even
unto
Nebo
and
Baalmeon:
005:009
And
eastward
he
inhabited
unto
the
entering
in
of
the
wilderness
from
the
river
Euphrates:
because
their
cattle
were
multiplied
in
the
land
of
Gilead.
005:010
And
in
the
days
of
Saul
they
made
war
with
the
Hagarites,
who
fell
by
their
hand:
and
they
dwelt
in
their
tents
throughout
all
the
east
land
of
Gilead.
005:011
And
the
children
of
Gad
dwelt
over
against
them,
in
the
land
of
Bashan
unto
Salcah:
005:012
Joel
the
chief,
and
Shapham
the
next,
and
Jaanai,
and
Shaphat
in
Bashan.
005:013
And
their
brethren
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
were,
Michael,
and
Meshullam,
and
Sheba,
and
Jorai,
and
Jachan,
and
Zia,
and
Heber,
seven.
005:014
These
are
the
children
of
Abihail
the
son
of
Huri,
the
son
of
Jaroah,
the
son
of
Gilead,
the
son
of
Michael,
the
son
of
Jeshishai,
the
son
of
Jahdo,
the
son
of
Buz;
005:015
Ahi
the
son
of
Abdiel,
the
son
of
Guni,
chief
of
the
house
of
their
fathers.
005:016
And
they
dwelt
in
Gilead
in
Bashan,
and
in
her
towns,
and
in
all
the
suburbs
of
Sharon,
upon
their
borders.
005:017
All
these
were
reckoned
by
genealogies
in
the
days
of
Jotham
king
of
Judah,
and
in
the
days
of
Jeroboam
king
of
Israel.
005:018
The
sons
of
Reuben,
and
the
Gadites,
and
half
the
tribe
of
Manasseh,
of
valiant
men,
men
able
to
bear
buckler
and
sword,
and
to
shoot
with
bow,
and
skilful
in
war,
were
four
and
forty
thousand
seven
hundred
and
threescore,
that
went
out
to
the
war.
005:019
And
they
made
war
with
the
Hagarites,
with
Jetur,
and
Nephish,
and
Nodab.
005:020
And
they
were
helped
against
them,
and
the
Hagarites
were
delivered
into
their
hand,
and
all
that
were
with
them:
for
they
cried
to
God
in
the
battle,
and
he
was
intreated
of
them;
because
they
put
their
trust
in
him.
005:021
And
they
took
away
their
cattle;
of
their
camels
fifty
thousand,
and
of
sheep
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand,
and
of
asses
two
thousand,
and
of
men
an
hundred
thousand.
005:022
For
there
fell
down
many
slain,
because
the
war
was
of
God.
And
they
dwelt
in
their
steads
until
the
captivity.
005:023
And
the
children
of
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
dwelt
in
the
land:
they
increased
from
Bashan
unto
Baalhermon
and
Senir,
and
unto
mount
Hermon.
005:024
And
these
were
the
heads
of
the
house
of
their
fathers,
even
Epher,
and
Ishi,
and
Eliel,
and
Azriel,
and
Jeremiah,
and
Hodaviah,
and
Jahdiel,
mighty
men
of
valour,
famous
men,
and
heads
of
the
house
of
their
fathers.
005:025
And
they
transgressed
against
the
God
of
their
fathers,
and
went
a
whoring
after
the
gods
of
the
people
of
the
land,
whom
God
destroyed
before
them.
005:026
And
the
God
of
Israel
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
Pul
king
of
Assyria,
and
the
spirit
of
Tilgathpilneser
king
of
Assyria,
and
he
carried
them
away,
even
the
Reubenites,
and
the
Gadites,
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh,
and
brought
them
unto
Halah,
and
Habor,
and
Hara,
and
to
the
river
Gozan,
unto
this
day.
006:001
The

006:010
And

begat

(he
it
is
that
executed
the
priest's
office
in
the
temple
that
Solomon
built
in
Jerusalem:)
006:011
And

006:014
And
Azariah
begat
Seraiah,
and
Seraiah
begat
Jehozadak,
006:015
And
Jehozadak
went
into
captivity,
when
the
LORD
carried
away
Judah
and
Jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
Nebuchadnezzar.
006:016
The
sons
of
Levi;
Gershom,
Kohath,
and
Merari.
006:017
And
these
be
the
names
of
the
