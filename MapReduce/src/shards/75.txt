And

of

were
mighty
men
of
valour,
archers,
and
had
many
sons,
and
sons'
sons,
an
hundred
and
fifty.
All
these
are
of
the
sons
of
Benjamin.
009:001
So
all
Israel
were
reckoned
by
genealogies;
and,
behold,
they
were
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Israel
and
Judah,
who
were
carried
away
to
Babylon
for
their
transgression.
009:002
Now
the
first
inhabitants
that
dwelt
in
their
possessions
in
their
cities
were,
the
Israelites,
the
priests,
Levites,
and
the
Nethinims.
009:003
And

according
to
their
generations,
nine
hundred
and
fifty
and
six.
All
these
men
were
chief
of
the
fathers
in
the
house
of
their
fathers.
009:010
And
of
the
priests;
Jedaiah,
and

and

009:011
And

the
son
of
Hilkiah,
the
son
of
Meshullam,
the
son
of
Zadok,
the
son
of
Meraioth,
the

009:012
And
Adaiah
the
son
of
Jeroham,
the
son
of
Pashur,
the
son
of
Malchijah,
and
Maasiai
the
son
of
Adiel,
the
son
of
Jahzerah,
the
son
of
Meshullam,
the
son
of
Meshillemith,
the
son
of
Immer;
009:013
And
their
brethren,
heads
of
the
house
of
their
fathers,
a
thousand
and
seven
hundred
and
threescore;
very
able
men
for
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
God.
009:014
And
of
the
Levites;
Shemaiah
the
son
of
Hasshub,
the
son
of
Azrikam,
the
son
of
Hashabiah,
of
the
sons
of
Merari;
009:015
And

Heresh,
and
Galal,
and
Mattaniah
the
son
of
Micah,
the
son
of
Zichri,
the
son
of

009:016
And
Obadiah
the
son
of
Shemaiah,
the
son
of
Galal,
the
son
of
Jeduthun,
and
Berechiah
the
son
of
Asa,
the
son
of
Elkanah,
that
dwelt
in
the
villages
of
the
Netophathites.
009:017
And
the
porters
were,
Shallum,
and
Akkub,
and
Talmon,
and
Ahiman,
and
their
brethren:
Shallum
was
the
chief;
009:018
Who
hitherto
waited
in
the
king's
gate
eastward:
they
were
porters
in
the
companies
of
the
children
of
Levi.
009:019
And
Shallum
the
son
of
Kore,
the
son
of
Ebiasaph,
the
son
of
Korah,
and
his
brethren,
of
the
house
of
his
father,
the
Korahites,
were
over
the
work
of
the
service,
keepers
of
the
gates
of
the
tabernacle:
and
their
fathers,
being
over
the
host
of
the
LORD,
were
keepers
of
the
entry.
009:020
And
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
was
the
ruler
over
them
in
time
past,
and
the
LORD
was
with
him.
009:021
And
Zechariah
the
son
of
Meshelemiah
was
porter
of
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation.
009:022
All
these
which
were
chosen
to
be
porters
in
the
gates
were
two
hundred
and
twelve.
These
were
reckoned
by
their
genealogy
in
their
villages,
whom
David
and
Samuel
the
seer
did
ordain
in
their
set
office.
009:023
So
they
and
their
children
had
the
oversight
of
the
gates
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
namely,
the
house
of
the
tabernacle,
by
wards.
009:024
In
four
quarters
were
the
porters,
toward
the
east,
west,
north,
and
south.
009:025
And
their
brethren,
which
were
in
their
villages,
were
to
come
after
seven
days
from
time
to
time
with
them.
009:026
For
these
Levites,
the
four
chief
porters,
were
in
their
set
office,
and
were
over
the
chambers
and
treasuries
of
the
house
of
God.
009:027
And
they
lodged
round
about
the
house
of
God,
because
the
charge
was
upon
them,
and
the
opening
thereof
every
morning
pertained
to
them.
009:028
And
certain
of
them
had
the
charge
of
the
ministering
vessels,
that
they
should
bring
them
in
and
out
by
tale.
009:029
Some
of
them
also
were
appointed
to
oversee
the
vessels,
and
all
the
instruments
of
the
sanctuary,
and
the
fine
flour,
and
the
wine,
and
the
oil,
and
the
frankincense,
and
the
spices.
009:030
And
some
of
the
sons
of
the
priests
made
the
ointment
of
the
spices.
009:031
And
Mattithiah,
one
of
the
Levites,
who
was
the
firstborn
of
Shallum
the
Korahite,
had
the
set
office
over
the
things
that
were
made
in
the
pans.
009:032
And
other
of
their
brethren,
of
the
sons
of
the
Kohathites,
were
over
the
shewbread,
to
prepare
it
every
sabbath.
009:033
And
these
are
the
singers,
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
Levites,
who
remaining
in
the
chambers
were
free:
for
they
were
employed
in
that
work
day
and
night.
009:034
These
chief
fathers
of
the
Levites
were
chief
throughout
their
generations;
these
dwelt
at
Jerusalem.
009:035
And
in
Gibeon
dwelt
the
father
of
Gibeon,
Jehiel,
whose
wife's
name
was
Maachah:
009:036
And
his
firstborn
son
Abdon,
then
Zur,
and
Kish,
and
Baal,
and
Ner,
and
Nadab.
009:037
And
Gedor,
and
Ahio,
and
Zechariah,
and
Mikloth.
009:038
And
Mikloth
begat
Shimeam.
And
they
also
dwelt
with
their
brethren
at
Jerusalem,
over
against
their
brethren.
009:039
And
Ner
begat
Kish;
and
Kish
begat
Saul;
and
Saul
begat
Jonathan,
and
Malchishua,
and
Abinadab,
and
Eshbaal.
009:040
And
the
son
of
Jonathan
was
Meribbaal:
and
Meribbaal
begat
Micah.
009:041
And
the
sons
of
Micah
were,
Pithon,
and
Melech,
and
Tahrea,
and
Ahaz.
009:042
And
Ahaz
begat
Jarah;
and
Jarah
begat
Alemeth,
and
Azmaveth,
and
Zimri;
and
Zimri
begat
Moza;
009:043
And
Moza
begat
Binea;
and
Rephaiah
his
son,
Eleasah
his
son,
Azel
his
son.
009:044
And
Azel
had
six
sons,
whose
names
are
these,
Azrikam,
Bocheru,
and
Ishmael,
and
Sheariah,
and
Obadiah,
and
Hanan:
these
were
the
sons
of
Azel.
010:001
Now
the
Philistines
fought
against
Israel;
and
the
men
of
Israel
fled
from
before
the
Philistines,
and
fell
down
slain
in
mount
Gilboa.
010:002
And
the
Philistines
followed
hard
after
Saul,
and
after
his
sons;
and
the
Philistines
slew
Jonathan,
and
Abinadab,
and
Malchishua,
the
sons
of
Saul.
010:003
And
the
battle
went
sore
against
Saul,
and
the
archers
hit
him,
and
he
was
wounded
of
the
archers.
010:004
Then
said
Saul
to
his
armourbearer,
Draw
thy
sword,
and
thrust
me
through
therewith;
lest
these
uncircumcised
come
and
abuse
me.
But
his
armourbearer
would
not;
for
he
was
sore
afraid.
So
Saul
took
a
sword,
and
fell
upon
it.
010:005
And
when
his
armourbearer
saw
that
Saul
was
dead,
he
fell
likewise
on
the
sword,
and
died.
010:006
So
Saul
died,
and
his
three
sons,
and
all
his
house
died
together.
010:007
And
when
all
the
men
of
Israel
that
were
in
the
valley
saw
that
they
fled,
and
that
Saul
and
his
sons
were
dead,
then
they
forsook
their
cities,
and
fled:
and
the
Philistines
came
and
dwelt
in
them.
010:008
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow,
when
the
Philistines
came
to
strip
the
slain,
that
they
found
Saul
and
his
sons
fallen
in
mount
Gilboa.
010:009
And
when
they
had
stripped
him,
they
took
his
head,
and
his
armour,
and
sent
into
the
land
of
the
Philistines
round
about,
to
carry
tidings
unto
their
idols,
and
to
the
people.
010:010
And
they
put
his
armour
in
the
house
of
their
gods,
and
fastened
his
head
in
the
temple
of
Dagon.
010:011
And
when
all
Jabeshgilead
heard
all
that
the
Philistines
had
done
to
Saul,
010:012
They
arose,
all
the
valiant
men,
and
took
away
the
body
of
Saul,
and
the
bodies
of
his
sons,
and
brought
them
to
Jabesh,
and
buried
their
bones
under
the
oak
in
Jabesh,
and
fasted
seven
days.
010:013
So
Saul
died
for
his
transgression
which
he
committed
against
the
LORD,
even
against
the
word
of
the
LORD,
which
he
kept
not,
and
also
for
asking
counsel
of
one
that
had
a
familiar
spirit,
to
enquire
of
it;
010:014
And
enquired
not
of
the
LORD:
therefore
he
slew
him,
and
turned
the
kingdom
unto
David
the
son
of
Jesse.
011:001
Then
all
Israel
gathered
themselves
to
David
unto
Hebron,
saying,
Behold,
we
are
thy
bone
and
thy
flesh.
011:002
And
moreover
in
time
past,
even
when
Saul
was
king,
thou
wast
he
that
leddest
out
and
broughtest
in
Israel:
and
the
LORD
thy
God
said
unto
thee,
Thou
shalt
feed
my
people
Israel,
and
thou
shalt
be
ruler
over
my
people
Israel.
011:003
Therefore
came
all
the
elders
of
Israel
to
the
king
to
Hebron;
and
David
made
a
covenant
with
them
in
Hebron
before
the
LORD;
and
they
anointed
David
king
over
Israel,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
Samuel.
011:004
And
David
and
all
Israel
went
to
Jerusalem,
which
is
Jebus;
where
the
Jebusites
were,
the
inhabitants
of
the
land.
011:005
And
the
inhabitants
of
Jebus
said
to
David,
Thou
shalt
not
come
hither.
Nevertheless
David
took
the
castle
of
Zion,
which
is
the
city
of
David.
011:006
And
David
said,
Whosoever
smiteth
the
Jebusites
first
shall
be
chief
and
captain.
So
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
went
first
up,
and
was
chief.
011:007
And
David
dwelt
in
the
castle;
therefore
they
called
it
the
city
of
David.
011:008
And
he
built
the
city
round
about,
even
from
Millo
round
about:
and
Joab
repaired
the
rest
of
the
city.
011:009
So
David
waxed
greater
and
greater:
for
the
LORD
of
hosts
was
with
him.
011:010
These
also
are
the
chief
of
the
mighty
men
whom
David
had,
who
strengthened
themselves
with
him
in
his
kingdom,
and
with
all
Israel,
to
make
him
king,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
concerning
Israel.
011:011
And
this
is
the
number
of
the
mighty
men
whom
David
had;
Jashobeam,
an
Hachmonite,
the
chief
of
the
captains:
he
lifted
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred
slain
by
him
at
one
time.
011:012
And
after
him
was
Eleazar
the
son
of
Dodo,
the
Ahohite,
who
was
one
of
the
three
mighties.
011:013
He
was
with
David
at
Pasdammim,
and
there
the
Philistines
were
gathered
together
to
battle,
where
was
a
parcel
of
ground
full
of
barley;
and
the
people
fled
from
before
the
Philistines.
011:014
And
they
set
themselves
in
the
midst
of
that
parcel,
and
delivered
it,
and
slew
the
Philistines;
and
the
LORD
saved
them
by
a
great
deliverance.
011:015
Now
three
of
the
thirty
captains
went
down
to
the
rock
to
David,
into
the
cave
of
Adullam;
and
the
host
of
the
Philistines
encamped
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
011:016
And
David
was
then
in
the
hold,
and
the
Philistines'
garrison
was
then
at
Bethlehem.
011:017
And
David
longed,
and
said,
Oh
that
one
would
give
me
drink
of
the
water
of
the
well
of
Bethlehem,
that
is
at
the
gate!
011:018
And
the
three
brake
through
the
host
of
the
Philistines,
and
drew
water
out
of
the
well
of
Bethlehem,
that
was
by
the
gate,
and
took
it,
and
brought
it
to
David:
but
David
would
not
drink
of
it,
but
poured
it
out
to
the
LORD.
011:019
And
said,
My
God
forbid
it
me,
that
I
should
do
this
thing:
shall
I
drink
the
blood
of
these
men
that
have
put
their
lives
in
jeopardy?
for
with
the
jeopardy
of
their
lives
they
brought
it.
Therefore
he
would
not
drink
it.
These
things
did
these
three
mightiest.
011:020
And
Abishai
the
brother
of
Joab,
he
was
chief
of
the
three:
for
lifting
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred,
he
slew
them,
and
had
a
name
among
the
three.
011:021
Of
the
three,
he
was
more
honourable
than
the
two;
for
he
was
their
captain:
howbeit
he
attained
not
to
the
first
three.
011:022
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
the
son
of
a
valiant
man
of
Kabzeel,
who
had
done
many
acts;
he
slew
two
lionlike
men
of
Moab:
also
he
went
down
and
slew
a
lion
in
a
pit
in
a
snowy
day.
011:023
And
he
slew
an
Egyptian,
a
man
of
great
stature,
five
cubits
high;
and
in
the
Egyptian's
hand
was
a
spear
like
a
weaver's
beam;
and
he
went
down
to
him
with
a
staff,
and
plucked
the
spear
out
of
the
Egyptian's
hand,
and
slew
him
with
his
own
spear.
011:024
These
things
did
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada,
and
had
the
name
among
the
three
mighties.
011:025
Behold,
he
was
honourable
among
the
thirty,
but
attained
not
to
the
first
three:
and
David
set
him
over
his
guard.

012:001
Now
these
are
they
that
came
to
David
to
Ziklag,
while
he
yet
kept
himself
close
because
of
Saul
the
son
of
Kish:
and
they
were
among
the
mighty
men,
helpers
of
the
war.
012:002
They
were
armed
with
bows,
and
could
use
both
the
right
hand
and
the
left
in
hurling
stones
and
shooting
arrows
out
of
a
bow,
even
of
Saul's
brethren
of
Benjamin.
012:003
The
chief
was

then

the
sons
of
Shemaah
the
Gibeathite;
and
Jeziel,
and
Pelet,
the
sons
of
Azmaveth;
and
Berachah,
and
Jehu
the
Antothite.
012:004
And
Ismaiah
the
Gibeonite,
a
mighty
man
among
the
thirty,
and
over
the
thirty;
and
Jeremiah,
and
Jahaziel,
and
Johanan,
and
Josabad
the
Gederathite,
012:005
Eluzai,
and
Jerimoth,
and

012:007
And
Joelah,
and
Zebadiah,
the
sons
of
Jeroham
of
Gedor.
012:008
And
of
the
Gadites
there
separated
themselves
unto
David
into
the
hold
to
the
wilderness
men
of
might,
and
men
of
war
fit
for
the
battle,
that
could
handle
shield
and
buckler,
whose
faces
were
like
the
faces
of
lions,
and
were
as
swift
as
the
roes
upon
the
mountains;
012:009
Ezer
the
first,
Obadiah
the
second,
Eliab
the
third,
012:010
Mishmannah
the
fourth,

the
fifth,
012:011
Attai
the
sixth,
Eliel
the
seventh,
012:012
Johanan
the
eighth,
Elzabad
the
ninth,
012:013
Jeremiah
the
tenth,
Machbanai
the
eleventh.
012:014
These
were
of
the
sons
of
Gad,
captains
of
the
host:
one
of
the
least
was
over
an
hundred,
and
the
greatest
over
a
thousand.
012:015
These
are
they
that
went
over
Jordan
in
the
first
month,
when
it
had
overflown
all
his
banks;
and
they
put
to
flight
all
them
of
the
valleys,
both
toward
the
east,
and
toward
the
west.
012:016
And
there
came
of
the
children
of
Benjamin
and
Judah
to
the
hold
unto
David.
012:017
And
David
went
out
to
meet
them,
and
answered
and
said
unto
them,
If
ye
be
come
peaceably
unto
me
to
help
me,
mine
heart
shall
be
knit
unto
you:
but
if
ye
be
come
to
betray
me
to
mine
enemies,
seeing
there
is
no
wrong
in
mine
hands,
the
God
of
our
fathers
look
thereon,
and
rebuke
it.
012:018
Then
the
spirit
came
upon
Amasai,
who
was
chief
of
the
captains,
and
he
said,
Thine
are
we,
David,
and
on
thy
side,
thou
son
of
Jesse:
peace,
peace
be
unto
thee,
and
peace
be
to
thine
helpers;
for
thy
God
helpeth
thee.
Then
David
received
them,
and
made
them
captains
of
the
band.
012:019
And
there
fell
some
of
Manasseh
to
David,
when
he
came
with
the
Philistines
against
Saul
to
battle:
but
they
helped
them
not:
for
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
upon
advisement
sent
him
away,
saying,
He
will
fall
to
his
master
Saul
to
the
jeopardy
of
our
heads.
012:020
As
he
went
to
Ziklag,
there
fell
to
him
of
Manasseh,
Adnah,
and
Jozabad,
and
Jediael,
and
Michael,
and
Jozabad,
and
Elihu,
and
Zilthai,
captains
of
the
thousands
that
were
of
Manasseh.
012:021
And
they
helped
David
against
the
band
of
the
rovers:
for
they
were
all
mighty
men
of
valour,
and
were
captains
in
the
host.
012:022
For
at
that
time
day
by
day
there
came
to
David
to
help
him,
until
it
was
a
great
host,
like
the
host
of
God.
012:023
And
these
are
the
numbers
of
the
bands
that
were
ready
armed
to
the
war,
and
came
to
David
to
Hebron,
to
turn
the
kingdom
of
Saul
to
him,
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD.
012:024
The
children
of
Judah
that
bare
shield
and
spear
were
six
thousand
and
eight
hundred,
ready
armed
to
the
war.
012:025
Of
the
children
of
Simeon,
mighty
men
of
valour
for
the
war,
seven
thousand
and
one
hundred.
012:026
Of
the
children
of
Levi
four
thousand
and
six
hundred.
012:027
And
Jehoiada
was
the
leader
of
the
Aaronites,
and
with
him
were
three
thousand
and
seven
hundred;
012:028
And
Zadok,
a
young
man
mighty
of
valour,
and
of
his
father's
house
twenty
and
two
captains.
012:029
And
of
the
children
of
Benjamin,
the
kindred
of
Saul,
three
thousand:
for
hitherto
the
greatest
part
of
them
had
kept
the
ward
of
the
house
of
Saul.
012:030
And
of
the
children
of
Ephraim
twenty
thousand
and
eight
hundred,
mighty
men
of
valour,
famous
throughout
the
house
of
their
fathers.
012:031
And
of
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
eighteen
thousand,
which
were
expressed
by
name,
to
come
and
make
David
king.
012:032
And
of
the
children
of
Issachar,
which
were
men
that
had
understanding
of
the
times,
to
know
what
Israel
ought
to
do;
the
heads
of
them
were
two
hundred;
and
all
their
brethren
were
at
their
commandment.
012:033
Of
Zebulun,
such
as
went
forth
to
battle,
expert
in
war,
with
all
instruments
of
war,
fifty
thousand,
which
could
keep
rank:
they
were
not
of
double
heart.
012:034
And
of
Naphtali
a
thousand
captains,
and
with
them
with
shield
and
spear
thirty
and
seven
thousand.
012:035
And
of
the
Danites
expert
in
war
twenty
and
eight
thousand
and
six
hundred.
012:036
And
of
Asher,
such
as
went
forth
to
battle,
expert
in
war,
forty
thousand.
012:037
And
on
the
other
side
of
Jordan,
of
the
Reubenites,
and
the
Gadites,
and
of
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh,
with
all
manner
of
instruments
of
war
for
the
battle,
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand.
012:038
All
these
men
of
war,
that
could
keep
rank,
came
with
a
perfect
heart
to
Hebron,
to
make
David
king
over
all
Israel:
and
all
the
rest
also
of
Israel
were
of
one
heart
to
make
David
king.
012:039
And
there
they
were
with
David
three
days,
eating
and
drinking:
for
their
brethren
had
prepared
for
them.
012:040
Moreover
they
that
were
nigh
them,
even
unto
Issachar
and
Zebulun
and
Naphtali,
brought
bread
on
asses,
and
on
camels,
and
on
mules,
and
on
oxen,
and
meat,
meal,
cakes
of
figs,
and
bunches
of
raisins,
and
wine,
and
oil,
and
oxen,
and
sheep
abundantly:
for
there
was
joy
in
Israel.
013:001
And
David
consulted
with
the
captains
of
thousands
and
hundreds,
and
with
every
leader.
013:002
And
David
said
unto
all
the
congregation
of
Israel,
If
it
seem
good
unto
you,
and
that
it
be
of
the
LORD
our
God,
let
us
send
abroad
unto
our
brethren
every
where,
that
are
left
in
all
the
land
of
Israel,
and
with
them
also
to
the
priests
and
Levites
which
are
in
their
cities
and
suburbs,
that
they
may
gather
themselves
unto
us:
013:003
And
let
us
bring
again
the
ark
of
our
God
to
us:
for
we
enquired
not
at
it
in
the
days
of
Saul.
013:004
And
all
the
congregation
said
that
they
would
do
so:
for
the
thing
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
people.
013:005
So
David
gathered
all
Israel
together,
from
Shihor
of
Egypt
even
unto
the
entering
of
Hemath,
to
bring
the
ark
of
God
from
Kirjathjearim.
013:006
And
David
went
up,
and
all
Israel,
to
Baalah,
that
is,
to
Kirjathjearim,
which
belonged
to
Judah,
to
bring
up
thence
the
ark
of
God
the
LORD,
that
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims,
whose
name
is
