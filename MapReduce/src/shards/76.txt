called
on
it.
013:007
And
they
carried
the
ark
of
God
in
a
new
cart
out
of
the
house
of
Abinadab:
and
Uzza
and
Ahio
drave
the
cart.
013:008
And
David
and
all
Israel
played
before
God
with
all
their
might,
and
with
singing,
and
with
harps,
and
with
psalteries,
and
with
timbrels,
and
with
cymbals,
and
with
trumpets.
013:009
And
when
they
came
unto
the
threshingfloor
of
Chidon,
Uzza
put
forth
his
hand
to
hold
the
ark;
for
the
oxen
stumbled.
013:010
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Uzza,
and
he
smote
him,
because
he
put
his
hand
to
the
ark:
and
there
he
died
before
God.
013:011
And
David
was
displeased,
because
the
LORD
had
made
a
breach
upon
Uzza:
wherefore
that
place
is
called
Perezuzza
to
this
day.
013:012
And
David
was
afraid
of
God
that
day,
saying,
How
shall
I
bring
the
ark
of
God
home
to
me?
013:013
So
David
brought
not
the
ark
home
to
himself
to
the
city
of
David,
but
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
Obededom
the
Gittite.
013:014
And
the
ark
of
God
remained
with
the
family
of
Obededom
in
his
house
three
months.
And
the
LORD
blessed
the
house
of
Obededom,
and
all
that
he
had.
014:001
Now
Hiram
king
of
Tyre
sent
messengers
to
David,
and
timber
of
cedars,
with
masons
and
carpenters,
to
build
him
an
house.
014:002
And
David
perceived
that
the
LORD
had
confirmed
him
king
over
Israel,
for
his
kingdom
was
lifted
up
on
high,
because
of
his
people
Israel.
014:003
And
David
took
more
wives
at
Jerusalem:
and
David
begat
more
sons
and
daughters.
014:004
Now
these
are
the
names
of
his
children
which
he
had
in
Jerusalem;
Shammua,
and
Shobab,
Nathan,
and
Solomon,
014:005
And
Ibhar,
and
Elishua,
and
Elpalet,
014:006
And
Nogah,
and
Nepheg,
and
Japhia,
014:007
And
Elishama,
and
Beeliada,
and
Eliphalet.
014:008
And
when
the
Philistines
heard
that
David
was
anointed
king
over
all
Israel,
all
the
Philistines
went
up
to
seek
David.
And
David
heard
of
it,
and
went
out
against
them.
014:009
And
the
Philistines
came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
014:010
And
David
enquired
of
God,
saying,
Shall
I
go
up
against
the
Philistines?
And
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
hand?
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Go
up;
for
I
will
deliver
them
into
thine
hand.
014:011
So
they
came
up
to
Baalperazim;
and
David
smote
them
there.
Then
David
said,
God
hath
broken
in
upon
mine
enemies
by
mine
hand
like
the
breaking
forth
of
waters:
therefore
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
Baalperazim.
014:012
And
when
they
had
left
their
gods
there,
David
gave
a
commandment,
and
they
were
burned
with
fire.
014:013
And
the
Philistines
yet
again
spread
themselves
abroad
in
the
valley.
014:014
Therefore
David
enquired
again
of
God;
and
God
said
unto
him,
Go
not
up
after
them;
turn
away
from
them,
and
come
upon
them
over
against
the
mulberry
trees.
014:015
And
it
shall
be,
when
thou
shalt
hear
a
sound
of
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
trees,
that
then
thou
shalt
go
out
to
battle:
for
God
is
gone
forth
before
thee
to
smite
the
host
of
the
Philistines.
014:016
David
therefore
did
as
God
commanded
him:
and
they
smote
the
host
of
the
Philistines
from
Gibeon
even
to
Gazer.
014:017
And
the
fame
of
David
went
out
into
all
lands;
and
the
LORD
brought
the
fear
of
him
upon
all
nations.
015:001
And
David
made
him
houses
in
the
city
of
David,
and
prepared
a
place
for
the
ark
of
God,
and
pitched
for
it
a
tent.
015:002
Then
David
said,
None
ought
to
carry
the
ark
of
God
but
the
Levites:
for
them
hath
the
LORD
chosen
to
carry
the
ark
of
God,
and
to
minister
unto
him
for
ever.
015:003
And
David
gathered
all
Israel
together
to
Jerusalem,
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD
unto
his
place,
which
he
had
prepared
for
it.
015:004
And
David
assembled
the
children
of
Aaron,
and
the
Levites:
015:005
Of
the
sons
of
Kohath;
Uriel
the
chief,
and
his
brethren
an
hundred
and
twenty:
015:006
Of
the
sons
of
Merari;
Asaiah
the
chief,
and
his
brethren
two
hundred
and
twenty:
015:007
Of
the
sons
of
Gershom;
Joel
the
chief
and
his
brethren
an
hundred
and
thirty:
015:008
Of
the
sons
of
Elizaphan;
Shemaiah
the
chief,
and
his
brethren
two
hundred:
015:009
Of
the
sons
of
Hebron;
Eliel
the
chief,
and
his
brethren
fourscore:
015:010
Of
the
sons
of
Uzziel;
Amminadab
the
chief,
and
his
brethren
an
hundred
and
twelve.
015:011
And
David
called
for
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests,
and
for
the
Levites,
for
Uriel,
Asaiah,
and
Joel,
Shemaiah,
and
Eliel,
and
Amminadab,
015:012
And
said
unto
them,
Ye
are
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
Levites:
sanctify
yourselves,
both
ye
and
your
brethren,
that
ye
may
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
unto
the
place
that
I
have
prepared
for
it.
015:013
For
because
ye
did
it
not
at
the
first,
the
LORD
our
God
made
a
breach
upon
us,
for
that
we
sought
him
not
after
the
due
order.
015:014
So
the
priests
and
the
Levites
sanctified
themselves
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
015:015
And
the
children
of
the
Levites
bare
the
ark
of
God
upon
their
shoulders
with
the
staves
thereon,
as
Moses
commanded
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD.
015:016
And
David
spake
to
the
chief
of
the
Levites
to
appoint
their
brethren
to
be
the
singers
with
instruments
of
musick,
psalteries
and
harps
and
cymbals,
sounding,
by
lifting
up
the
voice
with
joy.
015:017
So
the
Levites
appointed
Heman
the
son
of
Joel;
and
of
his
brethren,
Asaph
the
son
of
Berechiah;
and
of
the
sons
of
Merari
their
brethren,
Ethan
the
son
of
Kushaiah;
015:018
And
with
them
their
brethren
of
the
second
degree,
Zechariah,
Ben,
and
Jaaziel,
and
Shemiramoth,
and
Jehiel,
and
Unni,
Eliab,
and
Benaiah,
and
Maaseiah,
and
Mattithiah,
and
Elipheleh,
and
Mikneiah,
and
Obededom,
and
Jeiel,
the
porters.
015:019
So
the
singers,
Heman,
Asaph,
and
Ethan,
were
appointed
to
sound
with
cymbals
of
brass;
015:020
And
Zechariah,
and
Aziel,
and
Shemiramoth,
and
Jehiel,
and
Unni,
and
Eliab,
and
Maaseiah,
and
Benaiah,
with
psalteries
on
Alamoth;
015:021
And
Mattithiah,
and
Elipheleh,
and
Mikneiah,
and
Obededom,
and
Jeiel,
and
Azaziah,
with
harps
on
the
Sheminith
to
excel.
015:022
And
Chenaniah,
chief
of
the
Levites,
was
for
song:
he
instructed
about
the
song,
because
he
was
skilful.
015:023
And
Berechiah
and
Elkanah
were
doorkeepers
for
the
ark.
015:024
And
Shebaniah,
and
Jehoshaphat,
and
Nethaneel,
and
Amasai,
and
Zechariah,
and
Benaiah,
and
Eliezer,
the
priests,
did
blow
with
the
trumpets
before
the
ark
of
God:
and
Obededom
and
Jehiah
were
doorkeepers
for
the
ark.
015:025
So
David,
and
the
elders
of
Israel,
and
the
captains
over
thousands,
went
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
out
of
the
house
of
Obededom
with
joy.
015:026
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
God
helped
the
Levites
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
that
they
offered
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams.
015:027
And
David
was
clothed
with
a
robe
of
fine
linen,
and
all
the
Levites
that
bare
the
ark,
and
the
singers,
and
Chenaniah
the
master
of
the
song
with
the
singers:
David
also
had
upon
him
an
ephod
of
linen.
015:028
Thus
all
Israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
with
shouting,
and
with
sound
of
the
cornet,
and
with
trumpets,
and
with
cymbals,
making
a
noise
with
psalteries
and
harps.
015:029
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
came
to
the
city
of
David,
that
Michal,
the
daughter
of
Saul
looking
out
at
a
window
saw
king
David
dancing
and
playing:
and
she
despised
him
in
her
heart.
016:001
So
they
brought
the
ark
of
God,
and
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
tent
that
David
had
pitched
for
it:
and
they
offered
burnt
sacrifices
and
peace
offerings
before
God.
016:002
And
when
David
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
peace
offerings,
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
LORD.
016:003
And
he
dealt
to
every
one
of
Israel,
both
man
and
woman,
to
every
one
a
loaf
of
bread,
and
a
good
piece
of
flesh,
and
a
flagon
of
wine.
016:004
And
he
appointed
certain
of
the
Levites
to
minister
before
the
ark
of
the
LORD,
and
to
record,
and
to
thank
and
praise
the
LORD
God
of
Israel:
016:005
Asaph
the
chief,
and
next
to
him
Zechariah,
Jeiel,
and
Shemiramoth,
and
Jehiel,
and
Mattithiah,
and
Eliab,
and
Benaiah,
and
Obededom:
and
Jeiel
with
psalteries
and
with
harps;
but
Asaph
made
a
sound
with
cymbals;
016:006
Benaiah
also
and
Jahaziel
the
priests
with
trumpets
continually
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
God.
016:007
Then
on
that
day
David
delivered
first
this
psalm
to
thank
the
LORD
into
the
hand
of
Asaph
and
his
brethren.
016:008
Give
thanks
unto
the
LORD,
call
upon
his
name,
make
known
his
deeds
among
the
people.
016:009
Sing
unto
him,
sing
psalms
unto
him,
talk
ye
of
all
his
wondrous
works.
016:010
Glory
ye
in
his
holy
name:
let
the
heart
of
them
rejoice
that
seek
the
LORD.
016:011
Seek
the
LORD
and
his
strength,
seek
his
face
continually.
016:012
Remember
his
marvellous
works
that
he
hath
done,
his
wonders,
and
the
judgments
of
his
mouth;
016:013
O
ye
seed
of
Israel
his
servant,
ye
children
of
Jacob,
his
chosen
ones.
016:014
He
is
the
LORD
our
God;
his
judgments
are
in
all
the
earth.
016:015
Be
ye
mindful
always
of
his
covenant;
the
word
which
he
commanded
to
a
thousand
generations;
016:016
Even
of
the
covenant
which
he
made
with
Abraham,
and
of
his
oath
unto
Isaac;
016:017
And
hath
confirmed
the
same
to
Jacob
for
a
law,
and
to
Israel
for
an
everlasting
covenant,
016:018
Saying,
Unto
thee
will
I
give
the
land
of
Canaan,
the
lot
of
your
inheritance;
016:019
When
ye
were
but
few,
even
a
few,
and
strangers
in
it.
016:020
And
when
they
went
from
nation
to
nation,
and
from
one
kingdom
to
another
people;
016:021
He
suffered
no
man
to
do
them
wrong:
yea,
he
reproved
kings
for
their
sakes,
016:022
Saying,
Touch
not
mine
anointed,
and
do
my
prophets
no
harm.
016:023
Sing
unto
the
LORD,
all
the
earth;
shew
forth
from
day
to
day
his
salvation.
016:024
Declare
his
glory
among
the
heathen;
his
marvellous
works
among
all
nations.
016:025
For
great
is
the
LORD,
and
greatly
to
be
praised:
he
also
is
to
be
feared
above
all
gods.
016:026
For
all
the
gods
of
the
people
are
idols:
but
the
LORD
made
the
heavens.
016:027
Glory
and
honour
are
in
his
presence;
strength
and
gladness
are
in
his
place.
016:028
Give
unto
the
LORD,
ye
kindreds
of
the
people,
give
unto
the
LORD
glory
and
strength.
016:029
Give
unto
the
LORD
the
glory
due
unto
his
name:
bring
an
offering,
and
come
before
him:
worship
the
LORD
in
the
beauty
of
holiness.
016:030
Fear
before
him,
all
the
earth:
the
world
also
shall
be
stable,
that
it
be
not
moved.
016:031
Let
the
heavens
be
glad,
and
let
the
earth
rejoice:
and
let
men
say
among
the
nations,
The
LORD
reigneth.
016:032
Let
the
sea
roar,
and
the
fulness
thereof:
let
the
fields
rejoice,
and
all
that
is
therein.
016:033
Then
shall
the
trees
of
the
wood
sing
out
at
the
presence
of
the
LORD,
because
he
cometh
to
judge
the
earth.
016:034
O
give
thanks
unto
the
LORD;
for
he
is
good;
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
016:035
And
say
ye,
Save
us,
O
God
of
our
salvation,
and
gather
us
together,
and
deliver
us
from
the
heathen,
that
we
may
give
thanks
to
thy
holy
name,
and
glory
in
thy
praise.
016:036
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
for
ever
and
ever.
And
all
the
people
said,
Amen,
and
praised
the
LORD.
016:037
So
he
left
there
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
Asaph
and
his
brethren,
to
minister
before
the
ark
continually,
as
every
day's
work
required:
016:038
And
Obededom
with
their
brethren,
threescore
and
eight;
Obededom
also
the
son
of
Jeduthun
and
Hosah
to
be
porters:
016:039
And
Zadok
the
priest,
and
his
brethren
the
priests,
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD
in
the
high
place
that
was
at
Gibeon,
016:040
To
offer
burnt
offerings
unto
the
LORD
upon
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering
continually
morning
and
evening,
and
to
do
according
to
all
that
is
written
in
the
law
of
the
LORD,
which
he
commanded
Israel;
016:041
And
with
them
Heman
and
Jeduthun,
and
the
rest
that
were
chosen,
who
were
expressed
by
name,
to
give
thanks
to
the
LORD,
because
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever;
016:042
And
with
them
Heman
and
Jeduthun
with
trumpets
and
cymbals
for
those
that
should
make
a
sound,
and
with
musical
instruments
of
God.
And
the
sons
of
Jeduthun
were
porters.
016:043
And
all
the
people
departed
every
man
to
his
house:
and
David
returned
to
bless
his
house.
017:001
Now
it
came
to
pass,
as
David
sat
in
his
house,
that
David
said
to
Nathan
the
prophet,
Lo,
I
dwell
in
an
house
of
cedars,
but
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
remaineth
under
curtains.
017:002
Then
Nathan
said
unto
David,
Do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart;
for
God
is
with
thee.
017:003
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night,
that
the
word
of
God
came
to
Nathan,
saying,
017:004
Go
and
tell
David
my
servant,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Thou
shalt
not
build
me
an
house
to
dwell
in:
017:005
For
I
have
not
dwelt
in
an
house
since
the
day
that
I
brought
up
Israel
unto
this
day;
but
have
gone
from
tent
to
tent,
and
from
one
tabernacle
to
another.
017:006
Wheresoever
I
have
walked
with
all
Israel,
spake
I
a
word
to
any
of
the
judges
of
Israel,
whom
I
commanded
to
feed
my
people,
saying,
Why
have
ye
not
built
me
an
house
of
cedars?
017:007
Now
therefore
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
servant
David,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
hosts,
I
took
thee
from
the
sheepcote,
even
from
following
the
sheep,
that
thou
shouldest
be
ruler
over
my
people
Israel:
017:008
And
I
have
been
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
hast
walked,
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
from
before
thee,
and
have
made
thee
a
name
like
the
name
of
the
great
men
that
are
in
the
earth.
017:009
Also
I
will
ordain
a
place
for
my
people
Israel,
and
will
plant
them,
and
they
shall
dwell
in
their
place,
and
shall
be
moved
no
more;
neither
shall
the
children
of
wickedness
waste
them
any
more,
as
at
the
beginning,
017:010
And
since
the
time
that
I
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
Israel.
Moreover
I
will
subdue
all
thine
enemies.
Furthermore
I
tell
thee
that
the
LORD
will
build
thee
an
house.
017:011
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
thy
days
be
expired
that
thou
must
go
to
be
with
thy
fathers,
that
I
will
raise
up
thy
seed
after
thee,
which
shall
be
of
thy
sons;
and
I
will
establish
his
kingdom.
017:012
He
shall
build
me
an
house,
and
I
will
stablish
his
throne
for
ever.
017:013
I
will
be
his
father,
and
he
shall
be
my
son:
and
I
will
not
take
my
mercy
away
from
him,
as
I
took
it
from
him
that
was
before
thee:
017:014
But
I
will
settle
him
in
mine
house
and
in
my
kingdom
for
ever:
and
his
throne
shall
be
established
for
evermore.
017:015
According
to
all
these
words,
and
according
to
all
this
vision,
so
did
Nathan
speak
unto
David.
017:016
And
David
the
king
came
and
sat
before
the
LORD,
and
said,
Who
am
I,
O
LORD
God,
and
what
is
mine
house,
that
thou
hast
brought
me
hitherto?
017:017
And
yet
this
was
a
small
thing
in
thine
eyes,
O
God;
for
thou
hast
also
spoken
of
thy
servant's
house
for
a
great
while
to
come,
and
hast
regarded
me
according
to
the
estate
of
a
man
of
high
degree,
O
LORD
God.
017:018
What
can
David
speak
more
to
thee
for
the
honour
of
thy
servant?
for
thou
knowest
thy
servant.
017:019
O
LORD,
for
thy
servant's
sake,
and
according
to
thine
own
heart,
hast
thou
done
all
this
greatness,
in
making
known
all
these
great
things.
017:020
O
LORD,
there
is
none
like
thee,
neither
is
there
any
God
beside
thee,
according
to
all
that
we
have
heard
with
our
ears.
017:021
And
what
one
nation
in
the
earth
is
like
thy
people
Israel,
whom
God
went
to
redeem
to
be
his
own
people,
to
make
thee
a
name
of
greatness
and
terribleness,
by
driving
out
nations
from
before
thy
people
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
out
of
Egypt?
017:022
For
thy
people
Israel
didst
thou
make
thine
own
people
for
ever;
and
thou,
LORD,
becamest
their
God.
017:023
Therefore
now,
LORD,
let
the
thing
that
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
thy
servant
and
concerning
his
house
be
established
for
ever,
and
do
as
thou
hast
said.
017:024
Let
it
even
be
established,
that
thy
name
may
be
magnified
for
ever,
saying,
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
the
God
of
Israel,
even
a
God
to
Israel:
and
let
the
house
of
David
thy
servant
be
established
before
thee.
017:025
For
thou,
O
my
God,
hast
told
thy
servant
that
thou
wilt
build
him
an
house:
therefore
thy
servant
hath
found
in
his
heart
to
pray
before
thee.
017:026
And
now,
LORD,
thou
art
God,
and
hast
promised
this
goodness
unto
thy
servant:
017:027
Now
therefore
let
it
please
thee
to
bless
the
house
of
thy
servant,
that
it
may
be
before
thee
for
ever:
for
thou
blessest,
O
LORD,
and
it
shall
be
blessed
for
ever.
018:001
Now
after
this
it
came
to
pass,
that
David
smote
the
Philistines,
and
subdued
them,
and
took
Gath
and
her
towns
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines.
018:002
And
he
smote
Moab;
and
the
Moabites
became
David's
servants,
and
brought
gifts.
018:003
And
David
smote
Hadarezer
king
of
Zobah
unto
Hamath,
as
he
went
to
stablish
his
dominion
by
the
river
Euphrates.
018:004
And
David
took
from
him
a
thousand
chariots,
and
seven
thousand
horsemen,
and
twenty
thousand
footmen:
David
also
houghed
all
the
chariot
horses,
but
reserved
of
them
an
hundred
chariots.
018:005
And
when
the
Syrians
of
Damascus
came
to
help
Hadarezer
king
of
Zobah,
David
slew
of
the
Syrians
two
and
twenty
thousand
men.
018:006
Then
David
put
garrisons
in
Syriadamascus;
and
the
Syrians
became
David's
servants,
and
brought
gifts.
Thus
the
LORD
preserved
David
whithersoever
he
went.
018:007
And
David
took
the
shields
of
gold
that
were
on
the
servants
of
Hadarezer,
and
brought
them
to
Jerusalem.
018:008
Likewise
from
Tibhath,
and
from
Chun,
cities
of
Hadarezer,
brought
David
very
much
brass,
wherewith
Solomon
made
the
brasen
sea,
and
the
pillars,
and
the
vessels
of
brass.
018:009
Now
when
Tou
king
of
Hamath
heard
how
David
had
smitten
all
the
host
of
Hadarezer
king
of
Zobah;
018:010
He
sent
Hadoram
his
son
to
king
David,
to
enquire
of
his
welfare,
and
to
congratulate
him,
because
he
had
fought
against
Hadarezer,
and
smitten
him;
(for
Hadarezer
had
war
with
Tou;)
and
with
him
all
manner
of
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
and
brass.
018:011
Them
also
king
David
dedicated
unto
the
LORD,
with
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
he
brought
from
all
these
nations;
from
Edom,
and
from
Moab,
and
from
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
from
the
Philistines,
and
from
Amalek.
018:012
Moreover
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
slew
of
the
Edomites
in
the
valley
of
salt
eighteen
thousand.
018:013
And
he
put
garrisons
in
Edom;
and
all
the
Edomites
became
David's
servants.
Thus
the
LORD
preserved
David
whithersoever
he
went.
018:014
So
David
reigned
over
all
Israel,
and
executed
judgment
and
justice
among
all
his
people.
018:015
And
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
was
over
the
host;
and
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Ahilud,
recorder.
018:016
And
Zadok
the
son
of
Ahitub,
and
Abimelech
the
son
of
Abiathar,
were
the
priests;
and
Shavsha
was
scribe;
018:017
And
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
over
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites;
and
the
sons
of
David
were
chief
about
the
king.
019:001
Now
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
Nahash
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon
died,
and
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
019:002
And
David
said,
I
will
shew
kindness
unto
Hanun
the
son
of
Nahash,
because
his
father
shewed
kindness
to
me.
And
David
sent
messengers
to
comfort
him
concerning
his
father.
So
the
servants
of
David
came
into
the
land
of
the
children
of
Ammon
to
Hanun,
to
comfort
him.
019:003
But
the
princes
of
the
children
of
Ammon
said
to
Hanun,
Thinkest
thou
that
David
doth
honour
thy
father,
that
he
hath
sent
comforters
unto
thee?
are
not
his
servants
come
unto
thee
for
to
search,
and
to
overthrow,
and
to
spy
out
the
land?
019:004
Wherefore
Hanun
took
David's
servants,
and
shaved
them,
and
cut
off
their
garments
in
the
midst
hard
by
their
buttocks,
and
sent
them
away.
019:005
Then
there
went
certain,
and
told
David
how
the
men
were
served.
And
he
sent
to
meet
them:
for
the
men
were
greatly
ashamed.
And
the
king
said,
Tarry
at
Jericho
until
your
beards
be
grown,
and
then
return.
019:006
And
when
the
children
of
Ammon
saw
that
they
had
made
themselves
odious
to
David,
Hanun
and
the
children
of
Ammon
sent
a
thousand
talents
of
silver
to
hire
them
chariots
and
horsemen
out
of
Mesopotamia,
and
out
of
Syriamaachah,
and
out
of
Zobah.
019:007
So
they
hired
thirty
and
two
thousand
chariots,
and
the
king
of
Maachah
and
his
people;
who
came
and
pitched
before
Medeba.
And
the
children
of
Ammon
gathered
themselves
together
from
their
cities,
and
came
to
battle.
019:008
And
when
David
heard
of
it,
he
sent
Joab,
and
all
the
host
of
the
mighty
men.
019:009
And
the
children
of
Ammon
came
out,
and
put
the
battle
in
array
before
the
gate
of
the
city:
and
the
kings
that
were
come
were
by
themselves
in
the
field.
019:010
Now
when
Joab
saw
that
the
battle
was
set
against
him
before
and
behind,
he
chose
out
of
all
the
choice
of
Israel,
and
put
them
in
array
against
the
Syrians.
019:011
And
the
rest
of
the
people
he
delivered
unto
the
hand
of
Abishai
his
brother,
and
they
set
themselves
in
array
against
the
children
of
Ammon.
019:012
And
he
said,
If
the
Syrians
be
too
strong
for
me,
then
thou
shalt
help
me:
but
if
the
children
of
Ammon
be
too
strong
for
thee,
then
I
will
help
thee.
019:013
Be
of
good
courage,
and
let
us
behave
ourselves
valiantly
for
our
people,
and
for
the
cities
of
our
God:
and
let
the
LORD
do
that
which
is
good
in
his
sight.
019:014
So
Joab
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
drew
nigh
before
the
Syrians
unto
the
battle;
and
they
fled
before
him.
019:015
And
when
the
children
of
Ammon
saw
that
the
Syrians
were
fled,
they
likewise
fled
before
Abishai
his
brother,
and
entered
into
the
city.
Then
Joab
came
to
Jerusalem.
019:016
And
when
the
Syrians
saw
that
they
were
put
to
the
worse
before
Israel,
they
sent
messengers,
and
drew
forth
the
Syrians
that
were
beyond
the
river:
and
Shophach
the
captain
of
the
host
of
Hadarezer
went
before
them.
019:017
And
it
was
told
David;
and
he
gathered
all
Israel,
and
passed
over
Jordan,
and
came
upon
them,
and
set
the
battle
in
array
against
them.
So
when
David
had
put
the
battle
in
array
against
the
Syrians,
they
fought
with
him.
019:018
But
the
Syrians
fled
before
Israel;
and
David
slew
of
the
Syrians
seven
thousand
men
which
fought
in
chariots,
and
forty
thousand
footmen,
and
killed
Shophach
the
captain
of
the
host.
019:019
And
when
the
servants
of
Hadarezer
saw
that
they
were
put
to
the
worse
before
Israel,
they
made
peace
with
David,
and
became
his
servants:
neither
would
the
Syrians
help
the
children
of
Ammon
any
more.
020:001
And
it
came
