to
pass,
that
after
the
year
was
expired,
at
the
time
that
kings
go
out
to
battle,
Joab
led
forth
the
power
of
the
army,
and
wasted
the
country
of
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
came
and
besieged
Rabbah.
But
David
tarried
at
Jerusalem.
And
Joab
smote
Rabbah,
and
destroyed
it.
020:002
And
David
took
the
crown
of
their
king
from
off
his
head,
and
found
it
to
weigh
a
talent
of
gold,
and
there
were
precious
stones
in
it;
and
it
was
set
upon
David's
head:
and
he
brought
also
exceeding
much
spoil
out
of
the
city.
020:003
And
he
brought
out
the
people
that
were
in
it,
and
cut
them
with
saws,
and
with
harrows
of
iron,
and
with
axes.
Even
so
dealt
David
with
all
the
cities
of
the
children
of
Ammon.
And
David
and
all
the
people
returned
to
Jerusalem.
020:004
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
there
arose
war
at
Gezer
with
the
Philistines;
at
which
time
Sibbechai
the
Hushathite
slew
Sippai,
that
was
of
the
children
of
the
giant:
and
they
were
subdued.
020:005
And
there
was
war
again
with
the
Philistines;
and
Elhanan
the
son
of
Jair
slew
Lahmi
the
brother
of
Goliath
the
Gittite,
whose
spear
staff
was
like
a
weaver's
beam.
020:006
And
yet
again
there
was
war
at
Gath,
where
was
a
man
of
great
stature,
whose
fingers
and
toes
were
four
and
twenty,
six
on
each
hand,
and
six
on
each
foot
and
he
also
was
the
son
of
the
giant.
020:007
But
when
he
defied
Israel,
Jonathan
the
son
of
Shimea
David's
brother
slew
him.
020:008
These
were
born
unto
the
giant
in
Gath;
and
they
fell
by
the
hand
of
David,
and
by
the
hand
of
his
servants.
021:001
And
Satan
stood
up
against
Israel,
and
provoked
David
to
number
Israel.
021:002
And
David
said
to
Joab
and
to
the
rulers
of
the
people,
Go,
number
Israel
from
Beersheba
even
to
Dan;
and
bring
the
number
of
them
to
me,
that
I
may
know
it.
021:003
And
Joab
answered,
The
LORD
make
his
people
an
hundred
times
so
many
more
as
they
be:
but,
my
lord
the
king,
are
they
not
all
my
lord's
servants?
why
then
doth
my
lord
require
this
thing?
why
will
he
be
a
cause
of
trespass
to
Israel?
021:004
Nevertheless
the
king's
word
prevailed
against
Joab.
Wherefore
Joab
departed,
and
went
throughout
all
Israel,
and
came
to
Jerusalem.
021:005
And
Joab
gave
the
sum
of
the
number
of
the
people
unto
David.
And
all
they
of
Israel
were
a
thousand
thousand
and
an
hundred
thousand
men
that
drew
sword:
and
Judah
was
four
hundred
threescore
and
ten
thousand
men
that
drew
sword.
021:006
But
Levi
and
Benjamin
counted
he
not
among
them:
for
the
king's
word
was
abominable
to
Joab.
021:007
And
God
was
displeased
with
this
thing;
therefore
he
smote
Israel.
021:008
And
David
said
unto
God,
I
have
sinned
greatly,
because
I
have
done
this
thing:
but
now,
I
beseech
thee,
do
away
the
iniquity
of
thy
servant;
for
I
have
done
very
foolishly.
021:009
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Gad,
David's
seer,
saying,
021:010
Go
and
tell
David,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
I
offer
thee
three
things:
choose
thee
one
of
them,
that
I
may
do
it
unto
thee.
021:011
So
Gad
came
to
David,
and
said
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Choose
thee
021:012
Either
three
years'
famine;
or
three
months
to
be
destroyed
before
thy
foes,
while
that
the
sword
of
thine
enemies
overtaketh
thee;
or
else
three
days
the
sword
of
the
LORD,
even
the
pestilence,
in
the
land,
and
the
angel
of
the
LORD
destroying
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
Israel.
Now
therefore
advise
thyself
what
word
I
shall
bring
again
to
him
that
sent
me.
021:013
And
David
said
unto
Gad,
I
am
in
a
great
strait:
let
me
fall
now
into
the
hand
of
the
LORD;
for
very
great
are
his
mercies:
but
let
me
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
man.
021:014
So
the
LORD
sent
pestilence
upon
Israel:
and
there
fell
of
Israel
seventy
thousand
men.
021:015
And
God
sent
an
angel
unto
Jerusalem
to
destroy
it:
and
as
he
was
destroying,
the
LORD
beheld,
and
he
repented
him
of
the
evil,
and
said
to
the
angel
that
destroyed,
It
is
enough,
stay
now
thine
hand.
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
stood
by
the
threshingfloor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite.
021:016
And
David
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
saw
the
angel
of
the
LORD
stand
between
the
earth
and
the
heaven,
having
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
stretched
out
over
Jerusalem.
Then
David
and
the
elders
of
Israel,
who
were
clothed
in
sackcloth,
fell
upon
their
faces.
021:017
And
David
said
unto
God,
Is
it
not
I
that
commanded
the
people
to
be
numbered?
even
I
it
is
that
have
sinned
and
done
evil
indeed;
but
as
for
these
sheep,
what
have
they
done?
let
thine
hand,
I
pray
thee,
O
LORD
my
God,
be
on
me,
and
on
my
father's
house;
but
not
on
thy
people,
that
they
should
be
plagued.
021:018
Then
the
angel
of
the
LORD
commanded
Gad
to
say
to
David,
that
David
should
go
up,
and
set
up
an
altar
unto
the
LORD
in
the
threshingfloor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite.
021:019
And
David
went
up
at
the
saying
of
Gad,
which
he
spake
in
the
name
of
the
LORD.
021:020
And
Ornan
turned
back,
and
saw
the
angel;
and
his
four
sons
with
him
hid
themselves.
Now
Ornan
was
threshing
wheat.
021:021
And
as
David
came
to
Ornan,
Ornan
looked
and
saw
David,
and
went
out
of
the
threshingfloor,
and
bowed
himself
to
David
with
his
face
to
the
ground.
021:022
Then
David
said
to
Ornan,
Grant
me
the
place
of
this
threshingfloor,
that
I
may
build
an
altar
therein
unto
the
LORD:
thou
shalt
grant
it
me
for
the
full
price:
that
the
plague
may
be
stayed
from
the
people.
021:023
And
Ornan
said
unto
David,
Take
it
to
thee,
and
let
my
lord
the
king
do
that
which
is
good
in
his
eyes:
lo,
I
give
thee
the
oxen
also
for
burnt
offerings,
and
the
threshing
instruments
for
wood,
and
the
wheat
for
the
meat
offering;
I
give
it
all.
021:024
And
king
David
said
to
Ornan,
Nay;
but
I
will
verily
buy
it
for
the
full
price:
for
I
will
not
take
that
which
is
thine
for
the
LORD,
nor
offer
burnt
offerings
without
cost.
021:025
So
David
gave
to
Ornan
for
the
place
six
hundred
shekels
of
gold
by
weight.
021:026
And
David
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
LORD,
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings,
and
called
upon
the
LORD;
and
he
answered
him
from
heaven
by
fire
upon
the
altar
of
burnt
offering.
021:027
And
the
LORD
commanded
the
angel;
and
he
put
up
his
sword
again
into
the
sheath
thereof.
021:028
At
that
time
when
David
saw
that
the
LORD
had
answered
him
in
the
threshingfloor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite,
then
he
sacrificed
there.
021:029
For
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD,
which
Moses
made
in
the
wilderness,
and
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering,
were
at
that
season
in
the
high
place
at
Gibeon.
021:030
But
David
could
not
go
before
it
to
enquire
of
God:
for
he
was
afraid
because
of
the
sword
of
the
angel
of
the
LORD.
022:001
Then
David
said,
This
is
the
house
of
the
LORD
God,
and
this
is
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering
for
Israel.
022:002
And
David
commanded
to
gather
together
the
strangers
that
were
in
the
land
of
Israel;
and
he
set
masons
to
hew
wrought
stones
to
build
the
house
of
God.
022:003
And
David
prepared
iron
in
abundance
for
the
nails
for
the
doors
of
the
gates,
and
for
the
joinings;
and
brass
in
abundance
without
weight;
022:004
Also
cedar
trees
in
abundance:
for
the
Zidonians
and
they
of
Tyre
brought
much
cedar
wood
to
David.
022:005
And
David
said,
Solomon
my
son
is
young
and
tender,
and
the
house
that
is
to
be
builded
for
the
LORD
must
be
exceeding
magnifical,
of
fame
and
of
glory
throughout
all
countries:
I
will
therefore
now
make
preparation
for
it.
So
David
prepared
abundantly
before
his
death.
022:006
Then
he
called
for
Solomon
his
son,
and
charged
him
to
build
an
house
for
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
022:007
And
David
said
to
Solomon,
My
son,
as
for
me,
it
was
in
my
mind
to
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
LORD
my
God:
022:008
But
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
me,
saying,
Thou
hast
shed
blood
abundantly,
and
hast
made
great
wars:
thou
shalt
not
build
an
house
unto
my
name,
because
thou
hast
shed
much
blood
upon
the
earth
in
my
sight.
022:009
Behold,
a
son
shall
be
born
to
thee,
who
shall
be
a
man
of
rest;
and
I
will
give
him
rest
from
all
his
enemies
round
about:
for
his
name
shall
be
Solomon,
and
I
will
give
peace
and
quietness
unto
Israel
in
his
days.
022:010
He
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name;
and
he
shall
be
my
son,
and
I
will
be
his
father;
and
I
will
establish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
over
Israel
for
ever.
022:011
Now,
my
son,
the
LORD
be
with
thee;
and
prosper
thou,
and
build
the
house
of
the
LORD
thy
God,
as
he
hath
said
of
thee.
022:012
Only
the
LORD
give
thee
wisdom
and
understanding,
and
give
thee
charge
concerning
Israel,
that
thou
mayest
keep
the
law
of
the
LORD
thy
God.
022:013
Then
shalt
thou
prosper,
if
thou
takest
heed
to
fulfil
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
the
LORD
charged
Moses
with
concerning
Israel:
be
strong,
and
of
good
courage;
dread
not,
nor
be
dismayed.
022:014
Now,
behold,
in
my
trouble
I
have
prepared
for
the
house
of
the
LORD
an
hundred
thousand
talents
of
gold,
and
a
thousand
thousand
talents
of
silver;
and
of
brass
and
iron
without
weight;
for
it
is
in
abundance:
timber
also
and
stone
have
I
prepared;
and
thou
mayest
add
thereto.
022:015
Moreover
there
are
workmen
with
thee
in
abundance,
hewers
and
workers
of
stone
and
timber,
and
all
manner
of
cunning
men
for
every
manner
of
work.
022:016
Of
the
gold,
the
silver,
and
the
brass,
and
the
iron,
there
is
no
number.
Arise
therefore,
and
be
doing,
and
the
LORD
be
with
thee.
022:017
David
also
commanded
all
the
princes
of
Israel
to
help
Solomon
his
son,
saying,
022:018
Is
not
the
LORD
your
God
with
you?
and
hath
he
not
given
you
rest
on
every
side?
for
he
hath
given
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
into
mine
hand;
and
the
land
is
subdued
before
the
LORD,
and
before
his
people.
022:019
Now
set
your
heart
and
your
soul
to
seek
the
LORD
your
God;
arise
therefore,
and
build
ye
the
sanctuary
of
the
LORD
God,
to
bring
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
and
the
holy
vessels
of
God,
into
the
house
that
is
to
be
built
to
the
name
of
the
LORD.
023:001
So
when
David
was
old
and
full
of
days,
he
made
Solomon
his
son
king
over
Israel.
023:002
And
he
gathered
together
all
the
princes
of
Israel,
with
the
priests
and
the
Levites.
023:003
Now
the
Levites
were
numbered
from
the
age
of
thirty
years
and
upward:
and
their
number
by
their
polls,
man
by
man,
was
thirty
and
eight
thousand.
023:004
Of
which,
twenty
and
four
thousand
were
to
set
forward
the
work
of
the
house
of
the
LORD;
and
six
thousand
were
officers
and
judges:
023:005
Moreover
four
thousand
were
porters;
and
four
thousand
praised
the
LORD
with
the
instruments
which
I
made,
said
David,
to
praise
therewith.
023:006
And
David
divided
them
into
courses
among
the
sons
of
Levi,
namely,
Gershon,
Kohath,
and
Merari.
023:007
Of
the
Gershonites
were,
Laadan,
and
Shimei.
023:008
The
sons
of
Laadan;
the
chief
was
Jehiel,
and
Zetham,
and
Joel,
three.
023:009
The
sons
of
Shimei;
Shelomith,
and
Haziel,
and
Haran,
three.
These
were
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
Laadan.
023:010
And
the
sons
of
Shimei
were,
Jahath,
Zina,
and
Jeush,
and
Beriah.
These
four
were
the
sons
of
Shimei.
023:011
And
Jahath
was
the
chief,
and
Zizah
the
second:
but
Jeush
and
Beriah
had
not
many
sons;
therefore
they
were
in
one
reckoning,
according
to
their
father's
house.
023:012
The
sons
of
Kohath;
Amram,
Izhar,
Hebron,
and
Uzziel,
four.
023:013
The
sons
of
Amram;
Aaron
and
Moses:
and
Aaron
was
separated,
that
he
should
sanctify
the
most
holy
things,
he
and
his
sons
for
ever,
to
burn
incense
before
the
LORD,
to
minister
unto
him,
and
to
bless
in
his
name
for
ever.
023:014
Now
concerning
Moses
the
man
of
God,
his
sons
were
named
of
the
tribe
of
Levi.
023:015
The
sons
of
Moses
were,
Gershom,
and
Eliezer.
023:016
Of
the
sons
of
Gershom,
Shebuel
was
the
chief.
023:017
And
the
sons
of
Eliezer
were,
Rehabiah
the
chief.
And
Eliezer
had
none
other
sons;
but
the
sons
of
Rehabiah
were
very
many.
023:018
Of
the
sons
of
Izhar;
Shelomith
the
chief.
023:019
Of
the
sons
of
Hebron;
Jeriah
the
first,
Amariah
the
second,
Jahaziel
the
third,
and
Jekameam
the
fourth.
023:020
Of
the
sons
of
Uzziel;
Micah
the
first
and
Jesiah
the
second.
023:021
The
sons
of
Merari;
Mahli,
and
Mushi.
The
sons
of
Mahli;
Eleazar,
and
Kish.
023:022
And
Eleazar
died,
and
had
no
sons,
but
daughters:
and
their
brethren
the
sons
of
Kish
took
them.
023:023
The
sons
of
Mushi;
Mahli,
and
Eder,
and
Jeremoth,
three.
023:024
These
were
the
sons
of
Levi
after
the
house
of
their
fathers;
even
the
chief
of
the
fathers,
as
they
were
counted
by
number
of
names
by
their
polls,
that
did
the
work
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
from
the
age
of
twenty
years
and
upward.
023:025
For
David
said,
The
LORD
God
of
Israel
hath
given
rest
unto
his
people,
that
they
may
dwell
in
Jerusalem
for
ever:
023:026
And
also
unto
the
Levites;
they
shall
no
more
carry
the
tabernacle,
nor
any
vessels
of
it
for
the
service
thereof.
023:027
For
by
the
last
words
of
David
the
Levites
were
numbered
from
twenty
years
old
and
above:
023:028
Because
their
office
was
to
wait
on
the
sons
of
Aaron
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
in
the
courts,
and
in
the
chambers,
and
in
the
purifying
of
all
holy
things,
and
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
God;
023:029
Both
for
the
shewbread,
and
for
the
fine
flour
for
meat
offering,
and
for
the
unleavened
cakes,
and
for
that
which
is
baked
in
the
pan,
and
for
that
which
is
fried,
and
for
all
manner
of
measure
and
size;
023:030
And
to
stand
every
morning
to
thank
and
praise
the
LORD,
and
likewise
at
even:
023:031
And
to
offer
all
burnt
sacrifices
unto
the
LORD
in
the
sabbaths,
in
the
new
moons,
and
on
the
set
feasts,
by
number,
according
to
the
order
commanded
unto
them,
continually
before
the
LORD:
023:032
And
that
they
should
keep
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
the
charge
of
the
holy
place,
and
the
charge
of
the
sons
of
Aaron
their
brethren,
in
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
024:001
Now
these
are
the
divisions
of
the
sons
of
Aaron.
The
sons
of
Aaron;
Nadab,
and
Abihu,
Eleazar,
and
Ithamar.
024:002
But
Nadab
and
Abihu
died
before
their
father,
and
had
no
children:
therefore
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
executed
the
priest's
office.
024:003
And
David
distributed
them,
both
Zadok
of
the
sons
of
Eleazar,
and
Ahimelech
of
the
sons
of
Ithamar,
according
to
their
offices
in
their
service.
024:004
And
there
were
more
chief
men
found
of
the
sons
of
Eleazar
than
of
the
sons
of
Ithamar,
and
thus
were
they
divided.
Among
the
sons
of
Eleazar
there
were
sixteen
chief
men
of
the
house
of
their
fathers,
and
eight
among
the
sons
of
Ithamar
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers.
024:005
Thus
were
they
divided
by
lot,
one
sort
with
another;
for
the
governors
of
the
sanctuary,
and
governors
of
the
house
of
God,
were
of
the
sons
of
Eleazar,
and
of
the
sons
of
Ithamar.
024:006
And
Shemaiah
the
son
of
Nethaneel
the
scribe,
one
of
the
Levites,
wrote
them
before
the
king,
and
the
princes,
and
Zadok
the
priest,
and
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Abiathar,
and
before
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
priests
and
Levites:
one
principal
household
being
taken
for
Eleazar,
and
one
taken
for
Ithamar.
024:007
Now
the
first
lot
came
forth
to
Jehoiarib,
the
second
to
Jedaiah,
024:008
The
third
to
Harim,
the
fourth
to
Seorim,
024:009
The
fifth
to
Malchijah,
the
sixth
to
Mijamin,
024:010
The
seventh
to
Hakkoz,
the
eighth
to
Abijah,
024:011
The
ninth
to
Jeshuah,
the
tenth
to
Shecaniah,
024:012
The
eleventh
to
Eliashib,
the
twelfth
to
Jakim,
024:013
The
thirteenth
to
Huppah,
the
fourteenth
to
Jeshebeab,
024:014
The
fifteenth
to
Bilgah,
the
sixteenth
to
Immer,
024:015
The
seventeenth
to
Hezir,
the
eighteenth
to
Aphses,
024:016
The
nineteenth
to
Pethahiah,
the
twentieth
to
Jehezekel,
024:017
The
one
and
twentieth
to
Jachin,
the
two
and
twentieth
to
Gamul,
024:018
The
three
and
twentieth
to
Delaiah,
the
four
and
twentieth
to
Maaziah.
024:019
These
were
the
orderings
of
them
in
their
service
to
come
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
according
to
their
manner,
under
Aaron
their
father,
as
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
had
commanded
him.
024:020
And
the
rest
of
the
sons
of
Levi
were
these:
Of
the

024:025
The

Zechariah.
024:026
The
sons
of
Merari
were
Mahli
and

Beno.
024:027
The
sons
of
Merari
by
Jaaziah;
Beno,
and
Shoham,
and
Zaccur,
and

024:028
Of
Mahli
came
Eleazar,
who
had
no
sons.
024:029
Concerning
Kish:
the
son
of
Kish
was
Jerahmeel.
024:030
The
sons
also
of
Mushi;
Mahli,
and
Eder,
and
Jerimoth.
These
were
the
sons
of
the
Levites
after
the
house
of
their
fathers.
024:031
These
likewise
cast
lots
over
against
their
brethren
the
sons
of
Aaron
in
the
presence
of
David
the
king,
and
Zadok,
and
Ahimelech,
and
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
priests
and
Levites,
even
the
principal
fathers
over
against
their
younger
brethren.
025:001
Moreover
David
and
the
captains
of
the
host
separated
to
the
service
of
the
sons
of
Asaph,
and
of
Heman,
and
of
Jeduthun,
who
should
prophesy
with
harps,
with
psalteries,
and
with
cymbals:
and
the
number
of
the
workmen
according
to
their
service
was:
025:002
Of
the
sons
of
Asaph;
Zaccur,
and
Joseph,
and
Nethaniah,
and
Asarelah,
the
sons
of

of
the

025:003
Of

the

of
Jeduthun;
Gedaliah,
and
Zeri,
and
Jeshaiah,

and

under

in
the
words
of
God,
to
lift
up
the
horn.
And
God
gave
to
Heman
fourteen
sons
and
three

025:006
All
these
were

of
their

in

of
the
LORD,
with

for

of
the
house
of
God,
according
to
the
king's
order
to
Asaph,

025:007
So
the

that
were
instructed
in
the
songs
of
the
LORD,
even
all
that
were
cunning,

025:008
And
they
cast

Of

026:006
Also
unto

ruled
throughout
the

of
their

for

026:007

Also

026:020
