And

was

of
God,
and
over
the

of
the

things.
026:021
As
concerning
the
sons
of
Laadan;
the
sons
of
the
Gershonite
Laadan,
chief
fathers,
even
of
Laadan
the
Gershonite,
were
Jehieli.
026:022
The
sons
of
Jehieli;
Zetham,
and
Joel
his
brother,
which
were
over
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
026:023
Of
the
Amramites,
and
the
Izharites,
the
Hebronites,
and
the
Uzzielites:
026:024
And
Shebuel
the
son
of
Gershom,
the
son
of
Moses,
was
ruler
of
the
treasures.
026:025
And
his

his

and
Jeshaiah
his
son,
and
Joram
his
son,
and
Zichri
his
son,
and
Shelomith
his

026:026
Which
Shelomith
and
his

were
over
all
the
treasures
of
the
dedicated
things,
which
David
the
king,
and
the
chief
fathers,
the
captains
over
thousands
and
hundreds,
and
the

of
the
host,
had
dedicated.
026:027
Out
of
the
spoils
won
in
battles
did
they
dedicate
to
maintain
the

of
the
LORD.
026:028
And

Saul
the
son
of
Kish,
and
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
and
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
had

and
whosoever
had
dedicated
any
thing,
it
was
under
the
hand
of
Shelomith,
and
of
his
brethren.
026:029
Of
the
Izharites,
Chenaniah
and
his

were

the
outward
business
over
Israel,
for

and

026:030
And

and

of
Israel
on
this
side
Jordan
westward
in
all
the

of
the
LORD,
and
in
the
service
of
the
king.
026:031
Among
the
Hebronites
was
Jerijah
the
chief,
even
among
the
Hebronites,
according
to
the
generations
of
his
fathers.
In
the

the

of
David
they
were
sought
for,
and
there
were
found
among
them
mighty
men
of
valour
at
Jazer
of
Gilead.
026:032
And
his

men
of
valour,
were
two
thousand
and
seven
hundred
chief
fathers,
whom
king
David
made
rulers
over
the

the
Gadites,
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh,
for
every
matter
pertaining
to
God,
and
affairs
of
the
king.
027:001
Now
the
children
of
Israel
after
their

to

the

These

the
tribes
of
Israel.
027:023
But
David
took
not
the
number
of
them
from
twenty
years
old
and
under:
because
the
LORD
had
said
he
would
increase
Israel
like
to
the
stars
of
the
heavens.
027:024
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
began
to
number,
but
he
finished
not,
because
there
fell
wrath
for
it
against
Israel;
neither
was
the
number
put
in
the
account
of
the
chronicles
of
king
David.
027:025
And

All
these
were
the
rulers
of
the
substance
which
was
king
David's.
027:032
Also
Jonathan
David's
uncle
was
a
counsellor,
a
wise
man,
and
a
scribe:
and
Jehiel
the
son
of
Hachmoni
was
with
the
king's
sons:
027:033
And
Ahithophel
was
the
king's
counsellor:
and
Hushai
the
Archite
was
the
king's
companion:
027:034
And
after
Ahithophel
was
Jehoiada
the
son
of
Benaiah,
and
Abiathar:
and
the
general
of
the
king's
army
was
Joab.
028:001
And
David
assembled
all
the
princes
of
Israel,
the
princes
of
the
tribes,
and
the
captains
of
the
companies
that
ministered
to
the
king
by
course,
and
the
captains
over
the
thousands,
and
captains
over
the
hundreds,
and
the
stewards
over
all
the
substance
and
possession
of
the
king,
and
of
his
sons,
with
the
officers,
and
with
the
mighty
men,
and
with
all
the
valiant
men,
unto
Jerusalem.
028:002
Then
David
the
king
stood
up
upon
his
feet,
and
said,
Hear
me,
my
brethren,
and
my
people:
As
for
me,
I
had
in
mine
heart
to
build
an
house
of
rest
for
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
and
for
the
footstool
of
our
God,
and
had
made
ready
for
the
building:
028:003
But
God
said
unto
me,
Thou
shalt
not
build
an
house
for
my
name,
because
thou
hast
been
a
man
of
war,
and
hast
shed
blood.
028:004
Howbeit
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
chose
me
before
all
the
house
of
my
father
to
be
king
over
Israel
for
ever:
for
he
hath
chosen
Judah
to
be
the
ruler;
and
of
the
house
of
Judah,
the
house
of
my
father;
and
among
the
sons
of
my
father
he
liked
me
to
make
me
king
over
all
Israel:
028:005
And
of
all
my
sons,
(for
the
LORD
hath
given
me
many
sons,)
he
hath
chosen
Solomon
my
son
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
of
the
LORD
over
Israel.
028:006
And
he
said
unto
me,
Solomon
thy
son,
he
shall
build
my
house
and
my
courts:
for
I
have
chosen
him
to
be
my
son,
and
I
will
be
his
father.
028:007
Moreover
I
will
establish
his
kingdom
for
ever,
if
he
be
constant
to
do
my
commandments
and
my
judgments,
as
at
this
day.
028:008
Now
therefore
in
the
sight
of
all
Israel
the
congregation
of
the
LORD,
and
in
the
audience
of
our
God,
keep
and
seek
for
all
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your
God:
that
ye
may
possess
this
good
land,
and
leave
it
for
an
inheritance
for
your
children
after
you
for
ever.
028:009
And
thou,
Solomon
my
son,
know
thou
the
God
of
thy
father,
and
serve
him
with
a
perfect
heart
and
with
a
willing
mind:
for
the
LORD
searcheth
all
hearts,
and
understandeth
all
the
imaginations
of
the
thoughts:
if
thou
seek
him,
he
will
be
found
of
thee;
but
if
thou
forsake
him,
he
will
cast
thee
off
for
ever.
028:010
Take
heed
now;
for
the
LORD
hath
chosen
thee
to
build
an
house
for
the
sanctuary:
be
strong,
and
do
it.
028:011
Then
David
gave
to
Solomon
his
son
the
pattern
of
the
porch,
and
of
the
houses
thereof,
and
of
the
treasuries
thereof,
and
of
the
upper
chambers
thereof,
and
of
the
inner
parlours
thereof,
and
of
the
place
of
the
mercy
seat,
028:012
And
the
pattern
of
all
that
he
had
by
the
spirit,
of
the
courts
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
of
all
the
chambers
round
about,
of
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
God,
and
of
the
treasuries
of
the
dedicated
things:
028:013
Also
for
the
courses
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
and
for
all
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
for
all
the
vessels
of
service
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
028:014
He
gave
of
gold
by
weight
for
things
of
gold,
for
all
instruments
of
all
manner
of
service;
silver
also
for
all
instruments
of
silver
by
weight,
for
all
instruments
of
every
kind
of
service:
028:015
Even
the
weight
for
the
candlesticks
of
gold,
and
for
their
lamps
of
gold,
by
weight
for
every
candlestick,
and
for
the
lamps
thereof:
and
for
the
candlesticks
of
silver
by
weight,
both
for
the
candlestick,
and
also
for
the
lamps
thereof,
according
to
the
use
of
every
candlestick.
028:016
And
by
weight
he
gave
gold
for
the
tables
of
shewbread,
for
every
table;
and
likewise
silver
for
the
tables
of
silver:
028:017
Also
pure
gold
for
the
fleshhooks,
and
the
bowls,
and
the
cups:
and
for
the
golden
basons
he
gave
gold
by
weight
for
every
bason;
and
likewise
silver
by
weight
for
every
bason
of
silver:
028:018
And
for
the
altar
of
incense
refined
gold
by
weight;
and
gold
for
the
pattern
of
the
chariot
of
the
cherubims,
that
spread
out
their
wings,
and
covered
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD.
028:019
All
this,
said
David,
the
LORD
made
me
understand
in
writing
by
his
hand
upon
me,
even
all
the
works
of
this
pattern.
028:020
And
David
said
to
Solomon
his
son,
Be
strong
and
of
good
courage,
and
do
it:
fear
not,
nor
be
dismayed:
for
the
LORD
God,
even
my
God,
will
be
with
thee;
he
will
not
fail
thee,
nor
forsake
thee,
until
thou
hast
finished
all
the
work
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
028:021
And,
behold,
the
courses
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
even
they
shall
be
with
thee
for
all
the
service
of
the
house
of
God:
and
there
shall
be
with
thee
for
all
manner
of
workmanship
every
willing
skilful
man,
for
any
manner
of
service:
also
the
princes
and
all
the
people
will
be
wholly
at
thy
commandment.
029:001
Furthermore
David
the
king
said
unto
all
the
congregation,
Solomon
my
son,
whom
alone
God
hath
chosen,
is
yet
young
and
tender,
and
the
work
is
great:
for
the
palace
is
not
for
man,
but
for
the
LORD
God.
029:002
Now
I
have
prepared
with
all
my
might
for
the
house
of
my
God
the
gold
for
things
to
be
made
of
gold,
and
the
silver
for
things
of
silver,
and
the
brass
for
things
of
brass,
the
iron
for
things
of
iron,
and
wood
for
things
of
wood;
onyx
stones,
and
stones
to
be
set,
glistering
stones,
and
of
divers
colours,
and
all
manner
of
precious
stones,
and
marble
stones
in
abundance.
029:003
Moreover,
because
I
have
set
my
affection
to
the
house
of
my
God,
I
have
of
mine
own
proper
good,
of
gold
and
silver,
which
I
have
given
to
the
house
of
my
God,
over
and
above
all
that
I
have
prepared
for
the
holy
house.
029:004
Even
three
thousand
talents
of
gold,
of
the
gold
of
Ophir,
and
seven
thousand
talents
of
refined
silver,
to
overlay
the
walls
of
the
houses
withal:
029:005
The
gold
for
things
of
gold,
and
the
silver
for
things
of
silver,
and
for
all
manner
of
work
to
be
made
by
the
hands
of
artificers.
And
who
then
is
willing
to
consecrate
his
service
this
day
unto
the
LORD?
029:006
Then
the
chief
of
the
fathers
and
princes
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
and
the
captains
of
thousands
and
of
hundreds,
with
the
rulers
of
the
king's
work,
offered
willingly,
029:007
And
gave
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
God
of
gold
five
thousand
talents
and
ten
thousand
drams,
and
of
silver
ten
thousand
talents,
and
of
brass
eighteen
thousand
talents,
and
one
hundred
thousand
talents
of
iron.
029:008
And
they
with
whom
precious
stones
were
found
gave
them
to
the
treasure
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
by
the
hand
of
Jehiel
the
Gershonite.
029:009
Then
the
people
rejoiced,
for
that
they
offered
willingly,
because
with
perfect
heart
they
offered
willingly
to
the
LORD:
and
David
the
king
also
rejoiced
with
great
joy.
029:010
Wherefore
David
blessed
the
LORD
before
all
the
congregation:
and
David
said,
Blessed
be
thou,
LORD
God
of
Israel
our
father,
for
ever
and
ever.
029:011
Thine,
O
LORD
is
the
greatness,
and
the
power,
and
the
glory,
and
the
victory,
and
the
majesty:
for
all
that
is
in
the
heaven
and
in
the
earth
is
thine;
thine
is
the
kingdom,
O
LORD,
and
thou
art
exalted
as
head
above
all.
029:012
Both
riches
and
honour
come
of
thee,
and
thou
reignest
over
all;
and
in
thine
hand
is
power
and
might;
and
in
thine
hand
it
is
to
make
great,
and
to
give
strength
unto
all.
029:013
Now
therefore,
our
God,
we
thank
thee,
and
praise
thy
glorious
name.
029:014
But
who
am
I,
and
what
is
my
people,
that
we
should
be
able
to
offer
so
willingly
after
this
sort?
for
all
things
come
of
thee,
and
of
thine
own
have
we
given
thee.
029:015
For
we
are
strangers
before
thee,
and
sojourners,
as
were
all
our
fathers:
our
days
on
the
earth
are
as
a
shadow,
and
there
is
none
abiding.
029:016
O
LORD
our
God,
all
this
store
that
we
have
prepared
to
build
thee
an
house
for
thine
holy
name
cometh
of
thine
hand,
and
is
all
thine
own.
029:017
I
know
also,
my
God,
that
thou
triest
the
heart,
and
hast
pleasure
in
uprightness.
As
for
me,
in
the
uprightness
of
mine
heart
I
have
willingly
offered
all
these
things:
and
now
have
I
seen
with
joy
thy
people,
which
are
present
here,
to
offer
willingly
unto
thee.
029:018
O
LORD
God
of
Abraham,
Isaac,
and
of
Israel,
our
fathers,
keep
this
for
ever
in
the
imagination
of
the
thoughts
of
the
heart
of
thy
people,
and
prepare
their
heart
unto
thee:
029:019
And
give
unto
Solomon
my
son
a
perfect
heart,
to
keep
thy
commandments,
thy
testimonies,
and
thy
statutes,
and
to
do
all
these
things,
and
to
build
the
palace,
for
the
which
I
have
made
provision.
029:020
And
David
said
to
all
the
congregation,
Now
bless
the
LORD
your
God.
And
all
the
congregation
blessed
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers,
and
bowed
down
their
heads,
and
worshipped
the
LORD,
and
the
king.
029:021
And
they
sacrificed
sacrifices
unto
the
LORD,
and
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
LORD,
on
the
morrow
after
that
day,
even
a
thousand
bullocks,
a
thousand
rams,
and
a
thousand
lambs,
with
their
drink
offerings,
and
sacrifices
in
abundance
for
all
Israel:
029:022
And
did
eat
and
drink
before
the
LORD
on
that
day
with
great
gladness.
And
they
made
Solomon
the
son
of
David
king
the
second
time,
and
anointed
him
unto
the
LORD
to
be
the
chief
governor,
and
Zadok
to
be
priest.
029:023
Then
Solomon
sat
on
the
throne
of
the
LORD
as
king
instead
of
David
his
father,
and
prospered;
and
all
Israel
obeyed
him.
029:024
And
all
the
princes,
and
the
mighty
men,
and
all
the
sons
likewise
of
king
David,
submitted
themselves
unto
Solomon
the
king.
029:025
And
the
LORD
magnified
Solomon
exceedingly
in
the
sight
of
all
Israel,
and
bestowed
upon
him
such
royal
majesty
as
had
not
been
on
any
king
before
him
in
Israel.
029:026
Thus
David
the
son
of
Jesse
reigned
over
all
Israel.
029:027
And
the
time
that
he
reigned
over
Israel
was
forty
years;
seven
years
reigned
he
in
Hebron,
and
thirty
and
three
years
reigned
he
in
Jerusalem.
029:028
And
he
died
in
a
good
old
age,
full
of
days,
riches,
and
honour:
and
Solomon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
029:029
Now
the
acts
of
David
the
king,
first
and
last,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
Samuel
the
seer,
and
in
the
book
of
Nathan
the
prophet,
and
in
the
book
of
Gad
the
seer,
029:030
With
all
his
reign
and
his
might,
and
the
times
that
went
over
him,
and
over
Israel,
and
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
countries.
Book
14	2
Chronicles
001:001
And
Solomon
the
son
of
David
was
strengthened
in
his
kingdom,
and
the
LORD
his
God
was
with
him,
and
magnified
him
exceedingly.
001:002
Then
Solomon
spake
unto
all
Israel,
to
the
captains
of
thousands
and
of
hundreds,
and
to
the
judges,
and
to
every
governor
in
all
Israel,
the
chief
of
the
fathers.
001:003
So
Solomon,
and
all
the
congregation
with
him,
went
to
the
high
place
that
was
at
Gibeon;
for
there
was
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
of
God,
which
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
had
made
in
the
wilderness.
001:004
But
the
ark
of
God
had
David
brought
up
from
Kirjathjearim
to
the
place
which
David
had
prepared
for
it:
for
he
had
pitched
a
tent
for
it
at
Jerusalem.
001:005
Moreover
the
brasen
altar,
that
Bezaleel
the
son
of
Uri,
the
son
of
Hur,
had
made,
he
put
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
LORD:
and
Solomon
and
the
congregation
sought
unto
it.
001:006
And
Solomon
went
up
thither
to
the
brasen
altar
before
the
LORD,
which
was
at
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
offered
a
thousand
burnt
offerings
upon
it.
001:007
In
that
night
did
God
appear
unto
Solomon,
and
said
unto
him,
Ask
what
I
shall
give
thee.
001:008
And
Solomon
said
unto
God,
Thou
hast
shewed
great
mercy
unto
David
my
father,
and
hast
made
me
to
reign
in
his
stead.
001:009
Now,
O
LORD
God,
let
thy
promise
unto
David
my
father
be
established:
for
thou
hast
made
me
king
over
a
people
like
the
dust
of
the
earth
in
multitude.
001:010
Give
me
now
wisdom
and
knowledge,
that
I
may
go
out
and
come
in
before
this
people:
for
who
can
judge
this
thy
people,
that
is
so
great?
001:011
And
God
said
to
Solomon,
Because
this
was
in
thine
heart,
and
thou
hast
not
asked
riches,
wealth,
or
honour,
nor
the
life
of
thine
enemies,
neither
yet
hast
asked
long
life;
but
hast
asked
wisdom
and
knowledge
for
thyself,
that
thou
mayest
judge
my
people,
over
whom
I
have
made
thee
king:
001:012
Wisdom
and
knowledge
is
granted
unto
thee;
and
I
will
give
thee
riches,
and
wealth,
and
honour,
such
as
none
of
the
kings
have
had
that
have
been
before
thee,
neither
shall
there
any
after
thee
have
the
like.
001:013
Then
Solomon
came
from
his
journey
to
the
high
place
that
was
at
Gibeon
to
Jerusalem,
from
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
reigned
over
Israel.
001:014
And
Solomon
gathered
chariots
and
horsemen:
and
he
had
a
thousand
and
four
hundred
chariots,
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen,
which
he
placed
in
the
chariot
cities,
and
with
the
king
at
Jerusalem.
001:015
And
the
king
made
silver
and
gold
at
Jerusalem
as
plenteous
as
stones,
and
cedar
trees
made
he
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in
the
vale
for
abundance.
001:016
And
Solomon
had
horses
brought
out
of
Egypt,
and
linen
yarn:
the
king's
merchants
received
the
linen
yarn
at
a
price.
001:017
And
they
fetched
up,
and
brought
forth
out
of
Egypt
a
chariot
for
six
hundred
shekels
of
silver,
and
an
horse
for
an
hundred
and
fifty:
and
so
brought
they
out
horses
for
all
the
kings
of
the
Hittites,
and
for
the
kings
of
Syria,
by
their
means.
002:001
And
Solomon
determined
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
LORD,
and
an
house
for
his
kingdom.
002:002
And
Solomon
told
out
threescore
and
ten
thousand
men
to
bear
burdens,
and
fourscore
thousand
to
hew
in
the
mountain,
and
three
thousand
and
six
hundred
to
oversee
them.
002:003
And
Solomon
sent
to
Huram
the
king
of
Tyre,
saying,
As
thou
didst
deal
with
David
my
father,
and
didst
send
him
cedars
to
build
him
an
house
to
dwell
therein,
even
so
deal
with
me.
002:004
Behold,
I
build
an
house
to
the
name
of
the
LORD
my
God,
to
dedicate
it
to
him,
and
to
burn
before
him
sweet
incense,
and
for
the
continual
shewbread,
and
for
the
burnt
offerings
morning
and
evening,
on
the
sabbaths,
and
on
the
new
moons,
and
on
the
solemn
feasts
of
the
LORD
our
God.
This
is
an
ordinance
for
ever
to
Israel.
002:005
And
the
house
which
I
build
is
great:
for
great
is
our
God
above
all
gods.
002:006
But
who
is
able
to
build
him
an
house,
seeing
the
heaven
and
heaven
of
heavens
cannot
contain
him?
who
am
I
then,
that
I
should
build
him
an
house,
save
only
to
burn
sacrifice
before
him?
002:007
Send
me
now
therefore
a
man
cunning
to
work
in
gold,
and
in
silver,
and
in
brass,
and
in
iron,
and
in
purple,
and
crimson,
and
blue,
and
that
can
skill
to
grave
with
the
cunning
men
that
are
with
me
in
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem,
whom
David
my
father
did
provide.
002:008
Send
me
also
cedar
trees,
fir
trees,
and
algum
trees,
out
of
Lebanon:
for
I
know
that
thy
servants
can
skill
to
cut
timber
in
Lebanon;
and,
behold,
my
servants
shall
be
with
thy
servants,
002:009
Even
to
prepare
me
timber
in
abundance:
for
the
house
which
I
am
about
to
build
shall
be
wonderful
great.
002:010
And,
behold,
I
will
give
to
thy
servants,
the
hewers
that
cut
timber,
twenty
thousand
measures
of
beaten
wheat,
and
twenty
thousand
measures
of
barley,
and
twenty
thousand
baths
of
wine,
and
twenty
thousand
baths
of
oil.
002:011
Then
Huram
the
king
of
Tyre
answered
in
writing,
which
he
sent
to
Solomon,
Because
the
LORD
hath
loved
his
people,
he
hath
made
thee
king
over
them.
002:012
Huram
said
moreover,
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
that
made
heaven
and
earth,
who
hath
given
to
David
the
king
a
wise
son,
endued
with
prudence
and
understanding,
that
might
build
an
house
for
the
LORD,
and
an
house
for
his
kingdom.
002:013
And
now
I
have
sent
a
cunning
man,
