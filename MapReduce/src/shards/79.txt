endued
with
understanding,
of
Huram
my
father's,
002:014
The
son
of
a
woman
of
the
daughters
of
Dan,
and
his
father
was
a
man
of
Tyre,
skilful
to
work
in
gold,
and
in
silver,
in
brass,
in
iron,
in
stone,
and
in
timber,
in
purple,
in
blue,
and
in
fine
linen,
and
in
crimson;
also
to
grave
any
manner
of
graving,
and
to
find
out
every
device
which
shall
be
put
to
him,
with
thy
cunning
men,
and
with
the
cunning
men
of
my
lord
David
thy
father.
002:015
Now
therefore
the
wheat,
and
the
barley,
the
oil,
and
the
wine,
which
my
lord
hath
spoken
of,
let
him
send
unto
his
servants:
002:016
And
we
will
cut
wood
out
of
Lebanon,
as
much
as
thou
shalt
need:
and
we
will
bring
it
to
thee
in
floats
by
sea
to
Joppa;
and
thou
shalt
carry
it
up
to
Jerusalem.
002:017
And
Solomon
numbered
all
the
strangers
that
were
in
the
land
of
Israel,
after
the
numbering
wherewith
David
his
father
had
numbered
them;
and
they
were
found
an
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
three
thousand
and
six
hundred.
002:018
And
he
set
threescore
and
ten
thousand
of
them
to
be
bearers
of
burdens,
and
fourscore
thousand
to
be
hewers
in
the
mountain,
and
three
thousand
and
six
hundred
overseers
to
set
the
people
a
work.
003:001
Then
Solomon
began
to
build
the
house
of
the
LORD
at
Jerusalem
in
mount
Moriah,
where
the
Lord
appeared
unto
David
his
father,
in
the
place
that
David
had
prepared
in
the
threshingfloor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite.
003:002
And
he
began
to
build
in
the
second
day
of
the
second
month,
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
reign.
003:003
Now
these
are
the
things
wherein
Solomon
was
instructed
for
the
building
of
the
house
of
God.
The
length
by
cubits
after
the
first
measure
was
threescore
cubits,
and
the
breadth
twenty
cubits.
003:004
And
the
porch
that
was
in
the
front
of
the
house,
the
length
of
it
was
according
to
the
breadth
of
the
house,
twenty
cubits,
and
the
height
was
an
hundred
and
twenty:
and
he
overlaid
it
within
with
pure
gold.
003:005
And
the
greater
house
he
cieled
with
fir
tree,
which
he
overlaid
with
fine
gold,
and
set
thereon
palm
trees
and
chains.
003:006
And
he
garnished
the
house
with
precious
stones
for
beauty:
and
the
gold
was
gold
of
Parvaim.
003:007
He
overlaid
also
the
house,
the
beams,
the
posts,
and
the
walls
thereof,
and
the
doors
thereof,
with
gold;
and
graved
cherubims
on
the
walls.
003:008
And
he
made
the
most
holy
house,
the
length
whereof
was
according
to
the
breadth
of
the
house,
twenty
cubits,
and
the
breadth
thereof
twenty
cubits:
and
he
overlaid
it
with
fine
gold,
amounting
to
six
hundred
talents.
003:009
And
the
weight
of
the
nails
was
fifty
shekels
of
gold.
And
he
overlaid
the
upper
chambers
with
gold.
003:010
And
in
the
most
holy
house
he
made
two
cherubims
of
image
work,
and
overlaid
them
with
gold.
003:011
And
the
wings
of
the
cherubims
were
twenty
cubits
long:
one
wing
of
the
one
cherub
was
five
cubits,
reaching
to
the
wall
of
the
house:
and
the
other
wing
was
likewise
five
cubits,
reaching
to
the
wing
of
the
other
cherub.
003:012
And
one
wing
of
the
other
cherub
was
five
cubits,
reaching
to
the
wall
of
the
house:
and
the
other
wing
was
five
cubits
also,
joining
to
the
wing
of
the
other
cherub.
003:013
The
wings
of
these
cherubims
spread
themselves
forth
twenty
cubits:
and
they
stood
on
their
feet,
and
their
faces
were
inward.
003:014
And
he
made
the
vail
of
blue,
and
purple,
and
crimson,
and
fine
linen,
and
wrought
cherubims
thereon.
003:015
Also
he
made
before
the
house
two
pillars
of
thirty
and
five
cubits
high,
and
the
chapiter
that
was
on
the
top
of
each
of
them
was
five
cubits.
003:016
And
he
made
chains,
as
in
the
oracle,
and
put
them
on
the
heads
of
the
pillars;
and
made
an
hundred
pomegranates,
and
put
them
on
the
chains.
003:017
And
he
reared
up
the
pillars
before
the
temple,
one
on
the
right
hand,
and
the
other
on
the
left;
and
called
the
name
of
that
on
the
right
hand
Jachin,
and
the
name
of
that
on
the
left
Boaz.
004:001
Moreover
he
made
an
altar
of
brass,
twenty
cubits
the
length
thereof,
and
twenty
cubits
the
breadth
thereof,
and
ten
cubits
the
height
thereof.
004:002
Also
he
made
a
molten
sea
of
ten
cubits
from
brim
to
brim,
round
in
compass,
and
five
cubits
the
height
thereof;
and
a
line
of
thirty
cubits
did
compass
it
round
about.
004:003
And
under
it
was
the
similitude
of
oxen,
which
did
compass
it
round
about:
ten
in
a
cubit,
compassing
the
sea
round
about.
Two
rows
of
oxen
were
cast,
when
it
was
cast.
004:004
It
stood
upon
twelve
oxen,
three
looking
toward
the
north,
and
three
looking
toward
the
west,
and
three
looking
toward
the
south,
and
three
looking
toward
the
east:
and
the
sea
was
set
above
upon
them,
and
all
their
hinder
parts
were
inward.
004:005
And
the
thickness
of
it
was
an
handbreadth,
and
the
brim
of
it
like
the
work
of
the
brim
of
a
cup,
with
flowers
of
lilies;
and
it
received
and
held
three
thousand
baths.
004:006
He
made
also
ten
lavers,
and
put
five
on
the
right
hand,
and
five
on
the
left,
to
wash
in
them:
such
things
as
they
offered
for
the
burnt
offering
they
washed
in
them;
but
the
sea
was
for
the
priests
to
wash
in.
004:007
And
he
made
ten
candlesticks
of
gold
according
to
their
form,
and
set
them
in
the
temple,
five
on
the
right
hand,
and
five
on
the
left.
004:008
He
made
also
ten
tables,
and
placed
them
in
the
temple,
five
on
the
right
side,
and
five
on
the
left.
And
he
made
an
hundred
basons
of
gold.
004:009
Furthermore
he
made
the
court
of
the
priests,
and
the
great
court,
and
doors
for
the
court,
and
overlaid
the
doors
of
them
with
brass.
004:010
And
he
set
the
sea
on
the
right
side
of
the
east
end,
over
against
the
south.
004:011
And
Huram
made
the
pots,
and
the
shovels,
and
the
basons.
And
Huram
finished
the
work
that
he
was
to
make
for
king
Solomon
for
the
house
of
God;
004:012
To
wit,
the
two
pillars,
and
the
pommels,
and
the
chapiters
which
were
on
the
top
of
the
two
pillars,
and
the
two
wreaths
to
cover
the
two
pommels
of
the
chapiters
which
were
on
the
top
of
the
pillars;
004:013
And
four
hundred
pomegranates
on
the
two
wreaths;
two
rows
of
pomegranates
on
each
wreath,
to
cover
the
two
pommels
of
the
chapiters
which
were
upon
the
pillars.
004:014
He
made
also
bases,
and
lavers
made
he
upon
the
bases;
004:015
One
sea,
and
twelve
oxen
under
it.
004:016
The
pots
also,
and
the
shovels,
and
the
fleshhooks,
and
all
their
instruments,
did
Huram
his
father
make
to
king
Solomon
for
the
house
of
the
LORD
of
bright
brass.
004:017
In
the
plain
of
Jordan
did
the
king
cast
them,
in
the
clay
ground
between
Succoth
and
Zeredathah.
004:018
Thus
Solomon
made
all
these
vessels
in
great
abundance:
for
the
weight
of
the
brass
could
not
be
found
out.
004:019
And
Solomon
made
all
the
vessels
that
were
for
the
house
of
God,
the
golden
altar
also,
and
the
tables
whereon
the
shewbread
was
set;
004:020
Moreover
the
candlesticks
with
their
lamps,
that
they
should
burn
after
the
manner
before
the
oracle,
of
pure
gold;
004:021
And
the
flowers,
and
the
lamps,
and
the
tongs,
made
he
of
gold,
and
that
perfect
gold;
004:022
And
the
snuffers,
and
the
basons,
and
the
spoons,
and
the
censers,
of
pure
gold:
and
the
entry
of
the
house,
the
inner
doors
thereof
for
the
most
holy
place,
and
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
temple,
were
of
gold.
005:001
Thus
all
the
work
that
Solomon
made
for
the
house
of
the
LORD
was
finished:
and
Solomon
brought
in
all
the
things
that
David
his
father
had
dedicated;
and
the
silver,
and
the
gold,
and
all
the
instruments,
put
he
among
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
God.
005:002
Then
Solomon
assembled
the
elders
of
Israel,
and
all
the
heads
of
the
tribes,
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
children
of
Israel,
unto
Jerusalem,
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
out
of
the
city
of
David,
which
is
Zion.
005:003
Wherefore
all
the
men
of
Israel
assembled
themselves
unto
the
king
in
the
feast
which
was
in
the
seventh
month.
005:004
And
all
the
elders
of
Israel
came;
and
the
Levites
took
up
the
ark.
005:005
And
they
brought
up
the
ark,
and
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation,
and
all
the
holy
vessels
that
were
in
the
tabernacle,
these
did
the
priests
and
the
Levites
bring
up.
005:006
Also
king
Solomon,
and
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
that
were
assembled
unto
him
before
the
ark,
sacrificed
sheep
and
oxen,
which
could
not
be
told
nor
numbered
for
multitude.
005:007
And
the
priests
brought
in
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
unto
his
place,
to
the
oracle
of
the
house,
into
the
most
holy
place,
even
under
the
wings
of
the
cherubims:
005:008
For
the
cherubims
spread
forth
their
wings
over
the
place
of
the
ark,
and
the
cherubims
covered
the
ark
and
the
staves
thereof
above.
005:009
And
they
drew
out
the
staves
of
the
ark,
that
the
ends
of
the
staves
were
seen
from
the
ark
before
the
oracle;
but
they
were
not
seen
without.
And
there
it
is
unto
this
day.
005:010
There
was
nothing
in
the
ark
save
the
two
tables
which
Moses
put
therein
at
Horeb,
when
the
LORD
made
a
covenant
with
the
children
of
Israel,
when
they
came
out
of
Egypt.
005:011
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
priests
were
come
out
of
the
holy
place:
(for
all
the
priests
that
were
present
were
sanctified,
and
did
not
then
wait
by
course:
005:012
Also
the
Levites
which
were
the
singers,
all
of
them
of
Asaph,
of
Heman,
of
Jeduthun,
with
their
sons
and
their
brethren,
being
arrayed
in
white
linen,
having
cymbals
and
psalteries
and
harps,
stood
at
the
east
end
of
the
altar,
and
with
them
an
hundred
and
twenty
priests
sounding
with
trumpets:)
005:013
It
came
even
to
pass,
as
the
trumpeters
and
singers
were
as
one,
to
make
one
sound
to
be
heard
in
praising
and
thanking
the
LORD;
and
when
they
lifted
up
their
voice
with
the
trumpets
and
cymbals
and
instruments
of
musick,
and
praised
the
LORD,
saying,
For
he
is
good;
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever:
that
then
the
house
was
filled
with
a
cloud,
even
the
house
of
the
LORD;
005:014
So
that
the
priests
could
not
stand
to
minister
by
reason
of
the
cloud:
for
the
glory
of
the
LORD
had
filled
the
house
of
God.
006:001
Then
said
Solomon,
The
LORD
hath
said
that
he
would
dwell
in
the
thick
darkness.
006:002
But
I
have
built
an
house
of
habitation
for
thee,
and
a
place
for
thy
dwelling
for
ever.
006:003
And
the
king
turned
his
face,
and
blessed
the
whole
congregation
of
Israel:
and
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
stood.
006:004
And
he
said,
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
who
hath
with
his
hands
fulfilled
that
which
he
spake
with
his
mouth
to
my
father
David,
saying,
006:005
Since
the
day
that
I
brought
forth
my
people
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
I
chose
no
city
among
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
build
an
house
in,
that
my
name
might
be
there;
neither
chose
I
any
man
to
be
a
ruler
over
my
people
Israel:
006:006
But
I
have
chosen
Jerusalem,
that
my
name
might
be
there;
and
have
chosen
David
to
be
over
my
people
Israel.
006:007
Now
it
was
in
the
heart
of
David
my
father
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
006:008
But
the
LORD
said
to
David
my
father,
Forasmuch
as
it
was
in
thine
heart
to
build
an
house
for
my
name,
thou
didst
well
in
that
it
was
in
thine
heart:
006:009
Notwithstanding
thou
shalt
not
build
the
house;
but
thy
son
which
shall
come
forth
out
of
thy
loins,
he
shall
build
the
house
for
my
name.
006:010
The
LORD
therefore
hath
performed
his
word
that
he
hath
spoken:
for
I
am
risen
up
in
the
room
of
David
my
father,
and
am
set
on
the
throne
of
Israel,
as
the
LORD
promised,
and
have
built
the
house
for
the
name
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
006:011
And
in
it
have
I
put
the
ark,
wherein
is
the
covenant
of
the
LORD,
that
he
made
with
the
children
of
Israel.
006:012
And
he
stood
before
the
altar
of
the
LORD
in
the
presence
of
all
the
congregation
of
Israel,
and
spread
forth
his
hands:
006:013
For
Solomon
had
made
a
brasen
scaffold
of
five
cubits
long,
and
five
cubits
broad,
and
three
cubits
high,
and
had
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
court:
and
upon
it
he
stood,
and
kneeled
down
upon
his
knees
before
all
the
congregation
of
Israel,
and
spread
forth
his
hands
toward
heaven.
006:014
And
said,
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
there
is
no
God
like
thee
in
the
heaven,
nor
in
the
earth;
which
keepest
covenant,
and
shewest
mercy
unto
thy
servants,
that
walk
before
thee
with
all
their
hearts:
006:015
Thou
which
hast
kept
with
thy
servant
David
my
father
that
which
thou
hast
promised
him;
and
spakest
with
thy
mouth,
and
hast
fulfilled
it
with
thine
hand,
as
it
is
this
day.
006:016
Now
therefore,
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
keep
with
thy
servant
David
my
father
that
which
thou
hast
promised
him,
saying,
There
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
in
my
sight
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
Israel;
yet
so
that
thy
children
take
heed
to
their
way
to
walk
in
my
law,
as
thou
hast
walked
before
me.
006:017
Now
then,
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
let
thy
word
be
verified,
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
thy
servant
David.
006:018
But
will
God
in
very
deed
dwell
with
men
on
the
earth?
behold,
heaven
and
the
heaven
of
heavens
cannot
contain
thee;
how
much
less
this
house
which
I
have
built!
006:019
Have
respect
therefore
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant,
and
to
his
supplication,
O
LORD
my
God,
to
hearken
unto
the
cry
and
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
prayeth
before
thee:
006:020
That
thine
eyes
may
be
open
upon
this
house
day
and
night,
upon
the
place
whereof
thou
hast
said
that
thou
wouldest
put
thy
name
there;
to
hearken
unto
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
prayeth
toward
this
place.
006:021
Hearken
therefore
unto
the
supplications
of
thy
servant,
and
of
thy
people
Israel,
which
they
shall
make
toward
this
place:
hear
thou
from
thy
dwelling
place,
even
from
heaven;
and
when
thou
hearest,
forgive.
006:022
If
a
man
sin
against
his
neighbour,
and
an
oath
be
laid
upon
him
to
make
him
swear,
and
the
oath
come
before
thine
altar
in
this
house;
006:023
Then
hear
thou
from
heaven,
and
do,
and
judge
thy
servants,
by
requiting
the
wicked,
by
recompensing
his
way
upon
his
own
head;
and
by
justifying
the
righteous,
by
giving
him
according
to
his
righteousness.
006:024
And
if
thy
people
Israel
be
put
to
the
worse
before
the
enemy,
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee;
and
shall
return
and
confess
thy
name,
and
pray
and
make
supplication
before
thee
in
this
house;
006:025
Then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens,
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
people
Israel,
and
bring
them
again
unto
the
land
which
thou
gavest
to
them
and
to
their
fathers.
006:026
When
the
heaven
is
shut
up,
and
there
is
no
rain,
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee;
yet
if
they
pray
toward
this
place,
and
confess
thy
name,
and
turn
from
their
sin,
when
thou
dost
afflict
them;
006:027
Then
hear
thou
from
heaven,
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
servants,
and
of
thy
people
Israel,
when
thou
hast
taught
them
the
good
way,
wherein
they
should
walk;
and
send
rain
upon
thy
land,
which
thou
hast
given
unto
thy
people
for
an
inheritance.
006:028
If
there
be
dearth
in
the
land,
if
there
be
pestilence,
if
there
be
blasting,
or
mildew,
locusts,
or
caterpillers;
if
their
enemies
besiege
them
in
the
cities
of
their
land;
whatsoever
sore
or
whatsoever
sickness
there
be:
006:029
Then
what
prayer
or
what
supplication
soever
shall
be
made
of
any
man,
or
of
all
thy
people
Israel,
when
every
one
shall
know
his
own
sore
and
his
own
grief,
and
shall
spread
forth
his
hands
in
this
house:
006:030
Then
hear
thou
from
heaven
thy
dwelling
place,
and
forgive,
and
render
unto
every
man
according
unto
all
his
ways,
whose
heart
thou
knowest;
(for
thou
only
knowest
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men:)
006:031
That
they
may
fear
thee,
to
walk
in
thy
ways,
so
long
as
they
live
in
the
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
our
fathers.
006:032
Moreover
concerning
the
stranger,
which
is
not
of
thy
people
Israel,
but
is
come
from
a
far
country
for
thy
great
name's
sake,
and
thy
mighty
hand,
and
thy
stretched
out
arm;
if
they
come
and
pray
in
this
house;
006:033
Then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens,
even
from
thy
dwelling
place,
and
do
according
to
all
that
the
stranger
calleth
to
thee
for;
that
all
people
of
the
earth
may
know
thy
name,
and
fear
thee,
as
doth
thy
people
Israel,
and
may
know
that
this
house
which
I
have
built
is
called
by
thy
name.
006:034
If
thy
people
go
out
to
war
against
their
enemies
by
the
way
that
thou
shalt
send
them,
and
they
pray
unto
thee
toward
this
city
which
thou
hast
chosen,
and
the
house
which
I
have
built
for
thy
name;
006:035
Then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens
their
prayer
and
their
supplication,
and
maintain
their
cause.
006:036
If
they
sin
against
thee,
(for
there
is
no
man
which
sinneth
not,)
and
thou
be
angry
with
them,
and
deliver
them
over
before
their
enemies,
and
they
carry
them
away
captives
unto
a
land
far
off
or
near;
006:037
Yet
if
they
bethink
themselves
in
the
land
whither
they
are
carried
captive,
and
turn
and
pray
unto
thee
in
the
land
of
their
captivity,
saying,
We
have
sinned,
we
have
done
amiss,
and
have
dealt
wickedly;
006:038
If
they
return
to
thee
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
in
the
land
of
their
captivity,
whither
they
have
carried
them
captives,
and
pray
toward
their
land,
which
thou
gavest
unto
their
fathers,
and
toward
the
city
which
thou
hast
chosen,
and
toward
the
house
which
I
have
built
for
thy
name:
006:039
Then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens,
even
from
thy
dwelling
place,
their
prayer
and
their
supplications,
and
maintain
their
cause,
and
forgive
thy
people
which
have
sinned
against
thee.
006:040
Now,
my
God,
let,
I
beseech
thee,
thine
eyes
be
open,
and
let
thine
ears
be
attent
unto
the
prayer
that
is
made
in
this
place.
006:041
Now
therefore
arise,
O
LORD
God,
into
thy
resting
place,
thou,
and
the
ark
of
thy
strength:
let
thy
priests,
O
LORD
God,
be
clothed
with
salvation,
and
let
thy
saints
rejoice
in
goodness.
006:042
O
LORD
God,
turn
not
away
the
face
of
thine
anointed:
remember
the
mercies
of
David
thy
servant.
007:001
Now
when
Solomon
had
made
an
end
of
praying,
the
fire
came
down
from
heaven,
and
consumed
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sacrifices;
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
filled
the
house.
007:002
And
the
priests
could
not
enter
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
because
the
glory
of
the
LORD
had
filled
the
LORD's
house.
007:003
And
when
all
the
children
of
Israel
saw
how
the
fire
came
down,
and
the
glory
of
the
LORD
upon
the
house,
they
bowed
themselves
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
upon
the
pavement,
and
worshipped,
and
praised
the
LORD,
saying,
For
he
is
good;
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
007:004
Then
the
king
and
all
the
people
offered
sacrifices
before
the
LORD.
007:005
And
king
Solomon
offered
a
sacrifice
of
twenty
and
two
thousand
oxen,
and
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
sheep:
so
the
king
and
all
the
people
dedicated
the
house
of
God.
007:006
And
the
priests
waited
on
their
offices:
the
Levites
also
with
instruments
of
musick
of
the
LORD,
which
David
the
king
had
made
to
praise
the
LORD,
because
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever,
when
David
praised
by
their
ministry;
and
the
priests
sounded
trumpets
before
them,
and
all
Israel
stood.
007:007
Moreover
Solomon
hallowed
the
middle
of
the
court
that
was
before
the
house
of
the
LORD:
for
there
he
offered
burnt
offerings,
and
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings,
because
the
brasen
altar
which
Solomon
had
made
was
not
able
to
receive
the
burnt
offerings,
and
the
meat
offerings,
and
the
fat.
007:008
Also
at
the
same
time
Solomon
kept
the
feast
seven
days,
and
all
Israel
with
him,
a
very
great
congregation,
from
the
entering
in
of
Hamath
unto
the
river
of
Egypt.
007:009
And
in
the
eighth
day
they
made
a
solemn
assembly:
for
they
kept
the
dedication
of
the
altar
seven
days,
and
the
feast
seven
days.
007:010
And
on
the
three
and
twentieth
day
of
the
seventh
month
he
sent
the
people
away
into
their
tents,
glad
and
merry
in
heart
for
the
goodness
that
the
LORD
had
shewed
unto
David,
and
to
Solomon,
and
to
Israel
his
people.
007:011
Thus
Solomon
finished
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
king's
house:
and
all
that
came
into
Solomon's
heart
to
make
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
in
his
own
house,
he
prosperously
effected.
007:012
And
the
LORD
appeared
to
Solomon
by
night,
and
said
unto
him,
I
have
heard
thy
prayer,
and
have
chosen
this
place
to
myself
for
an
house
of
sacrifice.
007:013
If
I
shut
up
heaven
that
there
be
no
rain,
or
if
I
command
the
locusts
to
devour
the
land,
or
if
I
send
pestilence
among
my
people;
007:014
If
my
people,
which
are
called
by
my
name,
shall
humble
themselves,
and
pray,
and
seek
my
face,
and
turn
from
their
wicked
ways;
then
will
I
hear
from
heaven,
and
will
forgive
their
sin,
and
will
heal
their
land.
007:015
Now
mine
eyes
shall
be
open,
and
mine
ears
attent
unto
the
prayer
that
is
made
in
this
place.
007:016
For
now
have
I
chosen
and
sanctified
this
house,
that
my
name
may
be
there
for
ever:
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually.
007:017
And
as
for
thee,
if
thou
wilt
walk
before
me,
as
David
thy
father
walked,
and
do
according
to
all
that
I
have
commanded
thee,
and
shalt
observe
my
statutes
and
my
judgments;
007:018
Then
will
I
stablish
the
throne
of
thy
kingdom,
according
as
I
have
covenanted
with
David
thy
father,
saying,
There
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
to
be
ruler
in
Israel.
007:019
But
if
ye
turn
away,
and
forsake
my
statutes
and
my
commandments,
which
I
have
set
before
you,
and
shall
go
and
serve
other
gods,
and
worship
them;
007:020
Then
will
I
pluck
them
up
by
the
roots
out
of
my
land
which
I
have
given
them;
and
this
house,
which
I
have
sanctified
for
my
name,
will
I
cast
out
of
my
sight,
and
will
make
it
to
be
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
nations.
007:021
And
this
house,
which
is
high,
shall
be
an
astonishment
to
every
one
that
passeth
by
it;
so
that
he
shall
say,
Why
hath
the
LORD
done
thus
unto
this
land,
and
unto
this
house?
007:022
And
it
shall
be
answered,
Because
they
forsook
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers,
which
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
laid
hold
on
other
gods,
and
worshipped
them,
and
served
them:
therefore
hath
he
brought
all
this
evil
upon
them.
008:001
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
twenty
years,
wherein
Solomon
had
built
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
his
own
house,
008:002
That
the
cities
