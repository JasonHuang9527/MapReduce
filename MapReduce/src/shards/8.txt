are
spies.
042:017
And
he
put
them
all
together
into
ward
three
days.
042:018
And
Joseph
said
unto
them
the
third
day,
This
do,
and
live;
for
I
fear
God:
042:019
If
ye
be
true
men,
let
one
of
your
brethren
be
bound
in
the
house
of
your
prison:
go
ye,
carry
corn
for
the
famine
of
your
houses:
042:020
But
bring
your
youngest
brother
unto
me;
so
shall
your
words
be
verified,
and
ye
shall
not
die.
And
they
did
so.
042:021
And
they
said
one
to
another,
We
are
verily
guilty
concerning
our
brother,
in
that
we
saw
the
anguish
of
his
soul,
when
he
besought
us,
and
we
would
not
hear;
therefore
is
this
distress
come
upon
us.
042:022
And
Reuben
answered
them,
saying,
Spake
I
not
unto
you,
saying,
Do
not
sin
against
the
child;
and
ye
would
not
hear?
therefore,
behold,
also
his
blood
is
required.
042:023
And
they
knew
not
that
Joseph
understood
them;
for
he
spake
unto
them
by
an
interpreter.
042:024
And
he
turned
himself
about
from
them,
and
wept;
and
returned
to
them
again,
and
communed
with
them,
and
took
from
them
Simeon,
and
bound
him
before
their
eyes.
042:025
Then
Joseph
commanded
to
fill
their
sacks
with
corn,
and
to
restore
every
man's
money
into
his
sack,
and
to
give
them
provision
for
the
way:
and
thus
did
he
unto
them.
042:026
And
they
laded
their
asses
with
the
corn,
and
departed
thence.
042:027
And
as
one
of
them
opened
his
sack
to
give
his
ass
provender
in
the
inn,
he
espied
his
money;
for,
behold,
it
was
in
his
sack's
mouth.
042:028
And
he
said
unto
his
brethren,
My
money
is
restored;
and,
lo,
it
is
even
in
my
sack:
and
their
heart
failed
them,
and
they
were
afraid,
saying
one
to
another,
What
is
this
that
God
hath
done
unto
us?
042:029
And
they
came
unto
Jacob
their
father
unto
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
told
him
all
that
befell
unto
them;
saying,
042:030
The
man,
who
is
the
lord
of
the
land,
spake
roughly
to
us,
and
took
us
for
spies
of
the
country.
042:031
And
we
said
unto
him,
We
are
true
men;
we
are
no
spies:
042:032
We
be
twelve
brethren,
sons
of
our
father;
one
is
not,
and
the
youngest
is
this
day
with
our
father
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
042:033
And
the
man,
the
lord
of
the
country,
said
unto
us,
Hereby
shall
I
know
that
ye
are
true
men;
leave
one
of
your
brethren
here
with
me,
and
take
food
for
the
famine
of
your
households,
and
be
gone:
042:034
And
bring
your
youngest
brother
unto
me:
then
shall
I
know
that
ye
are
no
spies,
but
that
ye
are
true
men:
so
will
I
deliver
you
your
brother,
and
ye
shall
traffick
in
the
land.
042:035
And
it
came
to
pass
as
they
emptied
their
sacks,
that,
behold,
every
man's
bundle
of
money
was
in
his
sack:
and
when
both
they
and
their
father
saw
the
bundles
of
money,
they
were
afraid.
042:036
And
Jacob
their
father
said
unto
them,
Me
have
ye
bereaved
of
my
children:
Joseph
is
not,
and
Simeon
is
not,
and
ye
will
take
Benjamin
away:
all
these
things
are
against
me.
042:037
And
Reuben
spake
unto
his
father,
saying,
Slay
my
two
sons,
if
I
bring
him
not
to
thee:
deliver
him
into
my
hand,
and
I
will
bring
him
to
thee
again.
042:038
And
he
said,
My
son
shall
not
go
down
with
you;
for
his
brother
is
dead,
and
he
is
left
alone:
if
mischief
befall
him
by
the
way
in
the
which
ye
go,
then
shall
ye
bring
down
my
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave.
043:001
And
the
famine
was
sore
in
the
land.
043:002
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
had
eaten
up
the
corn
which
they
had
brought
out
of
Egypt,
their
father
said
unto
them,
Go
again,
buy
us
a
little
food.
043:003
And
Judah
spake
unto
him,
saying,
The
man
did
solemnly
protest
unto
us,
saying,
Ye
shall
not
see
my
face,
except
your
brother
be
with
you.
043:004
If
thou
wilt
send
our
brother
with
us,
we
will
go
down
and
buy
thee
food:
043:005
But
if
thou
wilt
not
send
him,
we
will
not
go
down:
for
the
man
said
unto
us,
Ye
shall
not
see
my
face,
except
your
brother
be
with
you.
043:006
And
Israel
said,
Wherefore
dealt
ye
so
ill
with
me,
as
to
tell
the
man
whether
ye
had
yet
a
brother?
043:007
And
they
said,
The
man
asked
us
straitly
of
our
state,
and
of
our
kindred,
saying,
Is
your
father
yet
alive?
have
ye
another
brother?
and
we
told
him
according
to
the
tenor
of
these
words:
could
we
certainly
know
that
he
would
say,
Bring
your
brother
down?
043:008
And
Judah
said
unto
Israel
his
father,
Send
the
lad
with
me,
and
we
will
arise
and
go;
that
we
may
live,
and
not
die,
both
we,
and
thou,
and
also
our
little
ones.
043:009
I
will
be
surety
for
him;
of
my
hand
shalt
thou
require
him:
if
I
bring
him
not
unto
thee,
and
set
him
before
thee,
then
let
me
bear
the
blame
for
ever:
043:010
For
except
we
had
lingered,
surely
now
we
had
returned
this
second
time.
043:011
And
their
father
Israel
said
unto
them,
If
it
must
be
so
now,
do
this;
take
of
the
best
fruits
in
the
land
in
your
vessels,
and
carry
down
the
man
a
present,
a
little
balm,
and
a
little
honey,
spices,
and
myrrh,
nuts,
and
almonds:
043:012
And
take
double
money
in
your
hand;
and
the
money
that
was
brought
again
in
the
mouth
of
your
sacks,
carry
it
again
in
your
hand;
peradventure
it
was
an
oversight:
043:013
Take
also
your
brother,
and
arise,
go
again
unto
the
man:
043:014
And
God
Almighty
give
you
mercy
before
the
man,
that
he
may
send
away
your
other
brother,
and
Benjamin.
If
I
be
bereaved
of
my
children,
I
am
bereaved.
043:015
And
the
men
took
that
present,
and
they
took
double
money
in
their
hand
and
Benjamin;
and
rose
up,
and
went
down
to
Egypt,
and
stood
before
Joseph.
043:016
And
when
Joseph
saw
Benjamin
with
them,
he
said
to
the
ruler
of
his
house,
Bring
these
men
home,
and
slay,
and
make
ready;
for
these
men
shall
dine
with
me
at
noon.
043:017
And
the
man
did
as
Joseph
bade;
and
the
man
brought
the
men
into
Joseph's
house.
043:018
And
the
men
were
afraid,
because
they
were
brought
into
Joseph's
house;
and
they
said,
Because
of
the
money
that
was
returned
in
our
sacks
at
the
first
time
are
we
brought
in;
that
he
may
seek
occasion
against
us,
and
fall
upon
us,
and
take
us
for
bondmen,
and
our
asses.
043:019
And
they
came
near
to
the
steward
of
Joseph's
house,
and
they
communed
with
him
at
the
door
of
the
house,
043:020
And
said,
O
sir,
we
came
indeed
down
at
the
first
time
to
buy
food:
043:021
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
we
came
to
the
inn,
that
we
opened
our
sacks,
and,
behold,
every
man's
money
was
in
the
mouth
of
his
sack,
our
money
in
full
weight:
and
we
have
brought
it
again
in
our
hand.
043:022
And
other
money
have
we
brought
down
in
our
hands
to
buy
food:
we
cannot
tell
who
put
our
money
in
our
sacks.
043:023
And
he
said,
Peace
be
to
you,
fear
not:
your
God,
and
the
God
of
your
father,
hath
given
you
treasure
in
your
sacks:
I
had
your
money.
And
he
brought
Simeon
out
unto
them.
043:024
And
the
man
brought
the
men
into
Joseph's
house,
and
gave
them
water,
and
they
washed
their
feet;
and
he
gave
their
asses
provender.
043:025
And
they
made
ready
the
present
against
Joseph
came
at
noon:
for
they
heard
that
they
should
eat
bread
there.
043:026
And
when
Joseph
came
home,
they
brought
him
the
present
which
was
in
their
hand
into
the
house,
and
bowed
themselves
to
him
to
the
earth.
043:027
And
he
asked
them
of
their
welfare,
and
said,
Is
your
father
well,
the
old
man
of
whom
ye
spake?
Is
he
yet
alive?
043:028
And
they
answered,
Thy
servant
our
father
is
in
good
health,
he
is
yet
alive.
And
they
bowed
down
their
heads,
and
made
obeisance.
043:029
And
he
lifted
up
his
eyes,
and
saw
his
brother
Benjamin,
his
mother's
son,
and
said,
Is
this
your
younger
brother,
of
whom
ye
spake
unto
me?
And
he
said,
God
be
gracious
unto
thee,
my
son.
043:030
And
Joseph
made
haste;
for
his
bowels
did
yearn
upon
his
brother:
and
he
sought
where
to
weep;
and
he
entered
into
his
chamber,
and
wept
there.
043:031
And
he
washed
his
face,
and
went
out,
and
refrained
himself,
and
said,
Set
on
bread.
043:032
And
they
set
on
for
him
by
himself,
and
for
them
by
themselves,
and
for
the
Egyptians,
which
did
eat
with
him,
by
themselves:
because
the
Egyptians
might
not
eat
bread
with
the
Hebrews;
for
that
is
an
abomination
unto
the
Egyptians.
043:033
And
they
sat
before
him,
the
firstborn
according
to
his
birthright,
and
the
youngest
according
to
his
youth:
and
the
men
marvelled
one
at
another.
043:034
And
he
took
and
sent
messes
unto
them
from
before
him:
but
Benjamin's
mess
was
five
times
so
much
as
any
of
their's.
And
they
drank,
and
were
merry
with
him.
044:001
And
he
commanded
the
steward
of
his
house,
saying,
Fill
the
men's
sacks
with
food,
as
much
as
they
can
carry,
and
put
every
man's
money
in
his
sack's
mouth.
044:002
And
put
my
cup,
the
silver
cup,
in
the
sack's
mouth
of
the
youngest,
and
his
corn
money.
And
he
did
according
to
the
word
that
Joseph
had
spoken.
044:003
As
soon
as
the
morning
was
light,
the
men
were
sent
away,
they
and
their
asses.
044:004
And
when
they
were
gone
out
of
the
city,
and
not
yet
far
off,
Joseph
said
unto
his
steward,
Up,
follow
after
the
men;
and
when
thou
dost
overtake
them,
say
unto
them,
Wherefore
have
ye
rewarded
evil
for
good?
044:005
Is
not
this
it
in
which
my
lord
drinketh,
and
whereby
indeed
he
divineth?
ye
have
done
evil
in
so
doing.
044:006
And
he
overtook
them,
and
he
spake
unto
them
these
same
words.
044:007
And
they
said
unto
him,
Wherefore
saith
my
lord
these
words?
God
forbid
that
thy
servants
should
do
according
to
this
thing:
044:008
Behold,
the
money,
which
we
found
in
our
sacks'
mouths,
we
brought
again
unto
thee
out
of
the
land
of
Canaan:
how
then
should
we
steal
out
of
thy
lord's
house
silver
or
gold?
044:009
With
whomsoever
of
thy
servants
it
be
found,
both
let
him
die,
and
we
also
will
be
my
lord's
bondmen.
044:010
And
he
said,
Now
also
let
it
be
according
unto
your
words:
he
with
whom
it
is
found
shall
be
my
servant;
and
ye
shall
be
blameless.
044:011
Then
they
speedily
took
down
every
man
his
sack
to
the
ground,
and
opened
every
man
his
sack.
044:012
And
he
searched,
and
began
at
the
eldest,
and
left
at
the
youngest:
and
the
cup
was
found
in
Benjamin's
sack.
044:013
Then
they
rent
their
clothes,
and
laded
every
man
his
ass,
and
returned
to
the
city.
044:014
And
Judah
and
his
brethren
came
to
Joseph's
house;
for
he
was
yet
there:
and
they
fell
before
him
on
the
ground.
044:015
And
Joseph
said
unto
them,
What
deed
is
this
that
ye
have
done?
wot
ye
not
that
such
a
man
as
I
can
certainly
divine?
044:016
And
Judah
said,
What
shall
we
say
unto
my
lord?
what
shall
we
speak?
or
how
shall
we
clear
ourselves?
God
hath
found
out
the
iniquity
of
thy
servants:
behold,
we
are
my
lord's
servants,
both
we,
and
he
also
with
whom
the
cup
is
found.
044:017
And
he
said,
God
forbid
that
I
should
do
so:
but
the
man
in
whose
hand
the
cup
is
found,
he
shall
be
my
servant;
and
as
for
you,
get
you
up
in
peace
unto
your
father.
044:018
Then
Judah
came
near
unto
him,
and
said,
Oh
my
lord,
let
thy
servant,
I
pray
thee,
speak
a
word
in
my
lord's
ears,
and
let
not
thine
anger
burn
against
thy
servant:
for
thou
art
even
as
Pharaoh.
044:019
My
lord
asked
his
servants,
saying,
Have
ye
a
father,
or
a
brother?
044:020
And
we
said
unto
my
lord,
We
have
a
father,
an
old
man,
and
a
child
of
his
old
age,
a
little
one;
and
his
brother
is
dead,
and
he
alone
is
left
of
his
mother,
and
his
father
loveth
him.
044:021
And
thou
saidst
unto
thy
servants,
Bring
him
down
unto
me,
that
I
may
set
mine
eyes
upon
him.
044:022
And
we
said
unto
my
lord,
The
lad
cannot
leave
his
father:
for
if
he
should
leave
his
father,
his
father
would
die.
044:023
And
thou
saidst
unto
thy
servants,
Except
your
youngest
brother
come
down
with
you,
ye
shall
see
my
face
no
more.
044:024
And
it
came
to
pass
when
we
came
up
unto
thy
servant
my
father,
we
told
him
the
words
of
my
lord.
044:025
And
our
father
said,
Go
again,
and
buy
us
a
little
food.
044:026
And
we
said,
We
cannot
go
down:
if
our
youngest
brother
be
with
us,
then
will
we
go
down:
for
we
may
not
see
the
man's
face,
except
our
youngest
brother
be
with
us.
044:027
And
thy
servant
my
father
said
unto
us,
Ye
know
that
my
wife
bare
me
two
sons:
044:028
And
the
one
went
out
from
me,
and
I
said,
Surely
he
is
torn
in
pieces;
and
I
saw
him
not
since:
044:029
And
if
ye
take
this
also
from
me,
and
mischief
befall
him,
ye
shall
bring
down
my
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave.
044:030
Now
therefore
when
I
come
to
thy
servant
my
father,
and
the
lad
be
not
with
us;
seeing
that
his
life
is
bound
up
in
the
lad's
life;
044:031
It
shall
come
to
pass,
when
he
seeth
that
the
lad
is
not
with
us,
that
he
will
die:
and
thy
servants
shall
bring
down
the
gray
hairs
of
thy
servant
our
father
with
sorrow
to
the
grave.
044:032
For
thy
servant
became
surety
for
the
lad
unto
my
father,
saying,
If
I
bring
him
not
unto
thee,
then
I
shall
bear
the
blame
to
my
father
for
ever.
044:033
Now
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
let
thy
servant
abide
instead
of
the
lad
a
bondman
to
my
lord;
and
let
the
lad
go
up
with
his
brethren.
044:034
For
how
shall
I
go
up
to
my
father,
and
the
lad
be
not
with
me?
lest
peradventure
I
see
the
evil
that
shall
come
on
my
father.
045:001
Then
Joseph
could
not
refrain
himself
before
all
them
that
stood
by
him;
and
he
cried,
Cause
every
man
to
go
out
from
me.
And
there
stood
no
man
with
him,
while
Joseph
made
himself
known
unto
his
brethren.
045:002
And
he
wept
aloud:
and
the
Egyptians
and
the
house
of
Pharaoh
heard.
045:003
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
brethren,
I
am
Joseph;
doth
my
father
yet
live?
And
his
brethren
could
not
answer
him;
for
they
were
troubled
at
his
presence.
045:004
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
brethren,
Come
near
to
me,
I
pray
you.
And
they
came
near.
And
he
said,
I
am
Joseph
your
brother,
whom
ye
sold
into
Egypt.
045:005
Now
therefore
be
not
grieved,
nor
angry
with
yourselves,
that
ye
sold
me
hither:
for
God
did
send
me
before
you
to
preserve
life.
045:006
For
these
two
years
hath
the
famine
been
in
the
land:
and
yet
there
are
five
years,
in
the
which
there
shall
neither
be
earing
nor
harvest.
045:007
And
God
sent
me
before
you
to
preserve
you
a
posterity
in
the
earth,
and
to
save
your
lives
by
a
great
deliverance.
045:008
So
now
it
was
not
you
that
sent
me
hither,
but
God:
and
he
hath
made
me
a
father
to
Pharaoh,
and
lord
of
all
his
house,
and
a
ruler
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
045:009
Haste
ye,
and
go
up
to
my
father,
and
say
unto
him,
Thus
saith
thy
son
Joseph,
God
hath
made
me
lord
of
all
Egypt:
come
down
unto
me,
tarry
not:
045:010
And
thou
shalt
dwell
in
the
land
of
Goshen,
and
thou
shalt
be
near
unto
me,
thou,
and
thy
children,
and
thy
children's
children,
and
thy
flocks,
and
thy
herds,
and
all
that
thou
hast:
045:011
And
there
will
I
nourish
thee;
for
yet
there
are
five
years
of
famine;
lest
thou,
and
thy
household,
and
all
that
thou
hast,
come
to
poverty.
045:012
And,
behold,
your
eyes
see,
and
the
eyes
of
my
brother
Benjamin,
that
it
is
my
mouth
that
speaketh
unto
you.
045:013
And
ye
shall
tell
my
father
of
all
my
glory
in
Egypt,
and
of
all
that
ye
have
seen;
and
ye
shall
haste
and
bring
down
my
father
hither.
045:014
And
he
fell
upon
his
brother
Benjamin's
neck,
and
wept;
and
Benjamin
wept
upon
his
neck.
045:015
Moreover
he
kissed
all
his
brethren,
and
wept
upon
them:
and
after
that
his
brethren
talked
with
him.
045:016
And
the
fame
thereof
was
heard
in
Pharaoh's
house,
saying,
Joseph's
brethren
are
come:
and
it
pleased
Pharaoh
well,
and
his
servants.
045:017
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph,
Say
unto
thy
brethren,
This
do
ye;
lade
your
beasts,
and
go,
get
you
unto
the
land
of
Canaan;
045:018
And
take
your
father
and
your
households,
and
come
unto
me:
and
I
will
give
you
the
good
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
ye
shall
eat
the
fat
of
the
land.
045:019
Now
thou
art
commanded,
this
do
ye;
take
you
wagons
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
for
your
little
ones,
and
for
your
wives,
and
bring
your
father,
and
come.
045:020
Also
regard
not
your
stuff;
for
the
good
of
all
the
land
of
Egypt
is
your's.
045:021
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
so:
and
Joseph
gave
them
wagons,
according
to
the
commandment
of
Pharaoh,
and
gave
them
provision
for
the
way.
045:022
To
all
of
them
he
gave
each
man
changes
of
raiment;
but
to
Benjamin
he
gave
three
hundred
pieces
of
silver,
and
five
changes
of
raiment.
045:023
And
to
his
father
he
sent
after
this
manner;
ten
asses
laden
with
the
good
things
of
Egypt,
and
ten
she
asses
laden
with
corn
and
bread
and
meat
for
his
father
by
the
way.
045:024
So
he
sent
his
brethren
away,
and
they
departed:
and
he
said
unto
them,
See
that
ye
fall
not
out
by
the
way.
045:025
And
they
went
up
out
of
Egypt,
and
came
into
the
land
of
Canaan
unto
Jacob
their
father,
045:026
And
told
him,
saying,
Joseph
is
yet
alive,
and
he
is
governor
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt.
And
Jacob's
heart
fainted,
for
he
believed
them
not.
045:027
And
they
told
him
all
the
words
of
Joseph,
which
he
had
said
unto
them:
and
when
he
saw
the
wagons
which
Joseph
had
sent
to
carry
him,
the
spirit
of
Jacob
their
father
revived:
045:028
And
Israel
said,
It
is
enough;
Joseph
my
son
is
yet
alive:
I
will
go
and
see
him
before
I
die.
046:001
And
Israel
took
his
journey
with
all
that
he
had,
and
came
to
Beersheba,
and
offered
sacrifices
unto
the
God
of
his
father
Isaac.
046:002
And
God
spake
unto
Israel
in
the
visions
of
the
night,
and
said,
Jacob,
Jacob.
And
he
said,
Here
am
I.
046:003
And
he
said,
I
am
God,
the
God
of
thy
father:
fear
not
to
go
down
into
Egypt;
for
I
will
there
make
of
thee
a
great
nation:
046:004
I
will
go
down
with
thee
into
Egypt;
and
I
will
also
surely
bring
thee
up
again:
and
Joseph
shall
put
his
hand
upon
thine
eyes.
046:005
And
Jacob
rose
up
from
Beersheba:
and
the
sons
of
Israel
carried
Jacob
their
father,
and
their
little
ones,
and
their
wives,
in
the
wagons
which
Pharaoh
had
sent
to
carry
him.
046:006
And
they
took
their
cattle,
and
their
goods,
which
they
had
gotten
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
came
into
Egypt,
Jacob,
and
all
his
seed
with
him:
046:007
His
sons,
and
his
sons'
sons
with
him,
his
daughters,
and
his
sons'
daughters,
and
all
his
seed
brought
he
with
him
into
Egypt.
046:008
And
these
are
the
names
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
came
into
Egypt,
Jacob
and
his
sons:
Reuben,
Jacob's
firstborn.
046:009
And
the
sons
of
Reuben;
Hanoch,
and
Phallu,
and
Hezron,
and
Carmi.
046:010
And
the
sons
of
Simeon;
Jemuel,
and
Jamin,
and
Ohad,
and
Jachin,
and
Zohar,
and
Shaul
the
son
of
a
Canaanitish
woman.
046:011
And
the
sons
of
Levi;
Gershon,
Kohath,
and
Merari.
046:012
And
the
sons
of
Judah;
Er,
and
Onan,
and
Shelah,
and
Pharez,
and
Zarah:
but
Er
and
Onan
died
in
the
land
of
Canaan.
And
the
sons
of
Pharez
were
Hezron
and
Hamul.
046:013
And
the
sons
of
Issachar;
Tola,
and
Phuvah,
and
Job,
and
Shimron.
046:014
And
the
sons
of
Zebulun;
Sered,
and
Elon,
and
Jahleel.
046:015
These
be
the
sons
of
Leah,
which
she
bare
unto
Jacob
in
Padanaram,
with
his
daughter
Dinah:
all
the
souls
of
his
sons
and
his
daughters
were
thirty
and
three.
046:016
And
the
sons
of
Gad;
Ziphion,
and
Haggi,
Shuni,
and
Ezbon,
Eri,
and
Arodi,
and
Areli.
046:017
And
the
sons
of
Asher;
Jimnah,
and
Ishuah,
and
Isui,
and
Beriah,
and
Serah
their
sister:
and
the
sons
of
Beriah;
Heber,
and
Malchiel.
046:018
These
are
the
sons
of
Zilpah,
whom
Laban
gave
to
Leah
his
daughter,
and
these
she
bare
unto
Jacob,
even
sixteen
souls.
046:019
The
sons
of
Rachel
Jacob's
wife;
Joseph,
and
Benjamin.
046:020
And
unto
Joseph
in
the
land
of
Egypt
were
born
Manasseh
and
Ephraim,
which
Asenath
the
daughter
of
Potipherah
priest
of
On
bare
unto
him.
046:021
And

Benjamin
were
Belah,
and
Becher,
and
Ashbel,
Gera,
and
Naaman,
Ehi,
and

046:022
These
are
the
sons
of
Rachel,
which
were
born
to
Jacob:
all
the
souls
were
fourteen.
046:023
And
the
sons
of
Dan;
Hushim.
046:024
And
the
sons
of
Naphtali;
Jahzeel,
and
Guni,
and
Jezer,
and
Shillem.
046:025
These
are
the
sons
of
Bilhah,
which
Laban
gave
unto
Rachel
his
daughter,
and
she
bare
these
unto
Jacob:
all
the
souls
were
seven.
046:026
All
the
souls
that
came
with
Jacob
into
Egypt,
which
came
out
of
his
loins,
besides
Jacob's
sons'
wives,
all
the
souls
were
threescore
and
six;
046:027
And
the
sons
of
Joseph,
which
were
born
him
in
Egypt,
were
two
souls:
all
the
souls
of
the
house
of
Jacob,
which
came
into
Egypt,
were
threescore
and
ten.
046:028
And
he
sent
Judah
before
him
unto
Joseph,
to
direct
his
face
unto
Goshen;
and
they
came
into
the
land
of
Goshen.
046:029
And
Joseph
made
ready
his
chariot,
and
went
up
to
meet
Israel
his
father,
to
Goshen,
and
presented
himself
unto
him;
and
he
fell
on
his
neck,
and
wept
on
his
neck
a
good
while.
046:030
And
Israel
said
unto
Joseph,
Now
let
me
die,
since
I
have
seen
thy
face,
because
thou
art
yet
alive.
046:031
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
brethren,
and
unto
his
father's
house,
I
will
go
up,
and
shew
Pharaoh,
and
say
unto
him,
My
brethren,
and
my
father's
house,
which
were
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
are
come
unto
me;
046:032
And
the
men
are
shepherds,
for
their
trade
hath
been
to
feed
cattle;
and
they
have
brought
their
flocks,
and
their
herds,
and
all
that
they
have.
046:033
And
it
shall
come
to
pass,
when
Pharaoh
shall
call
you,
and
shall
say,
What
is
your
occupation?
046:034
That
ye
shall
say,
Thy
servants'
trade
hath
been
about
cattle
from
our
youth
even
until
now,
both
we,
and
also
our
fathers:
that
ye
may
dwell
in
the
land
of
Goshen;
for
every
shepherd
is
an
abomination
unto
the
Egyptians.
047:001
Then
Joseph
came
and
told
Pharaoh,
and
said,
My
father
and
my
brethren,
and
their
flocks,
and
their
herds,
and
all
that
they
have,
are
come
out
of
the
land
of
