had
restored
to
Solomon,
Solomon
built
them,
and
caused
the
children
of
Israel
to
dwell
there.
008:003
And
Solomon
went
to
Hamathzobah,
and
prevailed
against
it.
008:004
And
he
built
Tadmor
in
the
wilderness,
and
all
the
store
cities,
which
he
built
in
Hamath.
008:005
Also
he
built
Bethhoron
the
upper,
and
Bethhoron
the
nether,
fenced
cities,
with
walls,
gates,
and
bars;
008:006
And
Baalath,
and
all
the
store
cities
that
Solomon
had,
and
all
the
chariot
cities,
and
the
cities
of
the
horsemen,
and
all
that
Solomon
desired
to
build
in
Jerusalem,
and
in
Lebanon,
and
throughout
all
the
land
of
his
dominion.
008:007
As
for
all
the
people
that
were
left
of
the
Hittites,
and
the
Amorites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites,
which
were
not
of
Israel,
008:008
But
of
their
children,
who
were
left
after
them
in
the
land,
whom
the
children
of
Israel
consumed
not,
them
did
Solomon
make
to
pay
tribute
until
this
day.
008:009
But
of
the
children
of
Israel
did
Solomon
make
no
servants
for
his
work;
but
they
were
men
of
war,
and
chief
of
his
captains,
and
captains
of
his
chariots
and
horsemen.
008:010
And
these
were
the
chief
of
king
Solomon's
officers,
even
two
hundred
and
fifty,
that
bare
rule
over
the
people.
008:011
And
Solomon
brought
up
the
daughter
of
Pharaoh
out
of
the
city
of
David
unto
the
house
that
he
had
built
for
her:
for
he
said,
My
wife
shall
not
dwell
in
the
house
of
David
king
of
Israel,
because
the
places
are
holy,
whereunto
the
ark
of
the
LORD
hath
come.
008:012
Then
Solomon
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
LORD
on
the
altar
of
the
LORD,
which
he
had
built
before
the
porch,
008:013
Even
after
a
certain
rate
every
day,
offering
according
to
the
commandment
of
Moses,
on
the
sabbaths,
and
on
the
new
moons,
and
on
the
solemn
feasts,
three
times
in
the
year,
even
in
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread,
and
in
the
feast
of
weeks,
and
in
the
feast
of
tabernacles.
008:014
And
he
appointed,
according
to
the
order
of
David
his
father,
the
courses
of
the
priests
to
their
service,
and
the
Levites
to
their
charges,
to
praise
and
minister
before
the
priests,
as
the
duty
of
every
day
required:
the
porters
also
by
their
courses
at
every
gate:
for
so
had
David
the
man
of
God
commanded.
008:015
And
they
departed
not
from
the
commandment
of
the
king
unto
the
priests
and
Levites
concerning
any
matter,
or
concerning
the
treasures.
008:016
Now
all
the
work
of
Solomon
was
prepared
unto
the
day
of
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
until
it
was
finished.
So
the
house
of
the
LORD
was
perfected.
008:017
Then
went
Solomon
to
Eziongeber,
and
to
Eloth,
at
the
sea
side
in
the
land
of
Edom.
008:018
And
Huram
sent
him
by
the
hands
of
his
servants
ships,
and
servants
that
had
knowledge
of
the
sea;
and
they
went
with
the
servants
of
Solomon
to
Ophir,
and
took
thence
four
hundred
and
fifty
talents
of
gold,
and
brought
them
to
king
Solomon.
009:001
And
when
the
queen
of
Sheba
heard
of
the
fame
of
Solomon,
she
came
to
prove
Solomon
with
hard
questions
at
Jerusalem,
with
a
very
great
company,
and
camels
that
bare
spices,
and
gold
in
abundance,
and
precious
stones:
and
when
she
was
come
to
Solomon,
she
communed
with
him
of
all
that
was
in
her
heart.
009:002
And
Solomon
told
her
all
her
questions:
and
there
was
nothing
hid
from
Solomon
which
he
told
her
not.
009:003
And
when
the
queen
of
Sheba
had
seen
the
wisdom
of
Solomon,
and
the
house
that
he
had
built,
009:004
And
the
meat
of
his
table,
and
the
sitting
of
his
servants,
and
the
attendance
of
his
ministers,
and
their
apparel;
his
cupbearers
also,
and
their
apparel;
and
his
ascent
by
which
he
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
LORD;
there
was
no
more
spirit
in
her.
009:005
And
she
said
to
the
king,
It
was
a
true
report
which
I
heard
in
mine
own
land
of
thine
acts,
and
of
thy
wisdom:
009:006
Howbeit
I
believed
not
their
words,
until
I
came,
and
mine
eyes
had
seen
it:
and,
behold,
the
one
half
of
the
greatness
of
thy
wisdom
was
not
told
me:
for
thou
exceedest
the
fame
that
I
heard.
009:007
Happy
are
thy
men,
and
happy
are
these
thy
servants,
which
stand
continually
before
thee,
and
hear
thy
wisdom.
009:008
Blessed
be
the
LORD
thy
God,
which
delighted
in
thee
to
set
thee
on
his
throne,
to
be
king
for
the
LORD
thy
God:
because
thy
God
loved
Israel,
to
establish
them
for
ever,
therefore
made
he
thee
king
over
them,
to
do
judgment
and
justice.
009:009
And
she
gave
the
king
an
hundred
and
twenty
talents
of
gold,
and
of
spices
great
abundance,
and
precious
stones:
neither
was
there
any
such
spice
as
the
queen
of
Sheba
gave
king
Solomon.
009:010
And
the
servants
also
of
Huram,
and
the
servants
of
Solomon,
which
brought
gold
from
Ophir,
brought
algum
trees
and
precious
stones.
009:011
And
the
king
made
of
the
algum
trees
terraces
to
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
to
the
king's
palace,
and
harps
and
psalteries
for
singers:
and
there
were
none
such
seen
before
in
the
land
of
Judah.
009:012
And
king
Solomon
gave
to
the
queen
of
Sheba
all
her
desire,
whatsoever
she
asked,
beside
that
which
she
had
brought
unto
the
king.
So
she
turned,
and
went
away
to
her
own
land,
she
and
her
servants.
009:013
Now
the
weight
of
gold
that
came
to
Solomon
in
one
year
was
six
hundred
and
threescore
and
six
talents
of
gold;
009:014
Beside
that
which
chapmen
and
merchants
brought.
And
all
the
kings
of
Arabia
and
governors
of
the
country
brought
gold
and
silver
to
Solomon.
009:015
And
king
Solomon
made
two
hundred
targets
of
beaten
gold:
six
hundred
shekels
of
beaten
gold
went
to
one
target.
009:016
And
three
hundred
shields
made
he
of
beaten
gold:
three
hundred
shekels
of
gold
went
to
one
shield.
And
the
king
put
them
in
the
house
of
the
forest
of
Lebanon.
009:017
Moreover
the
king
made
a
great
throne
of
ivory,
and
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold.
009:018
And
there
were
six
steps
to
the
throne,
with
a
footstool
of
gold,
which
were
fastened
to
the
throne,
and
stays
on
each
side
of
the
sitting
place,
and
two
lions
standing
by
the
stays:
009:019
And
twelve
lions
stood
there
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
upon
the
six
steps.
There
was
not
the
like
made
in
any
kingdom.
009:020
And
all
the
drinking
vessels
of
king
Solomon
were
of
gold,
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
the
forest
of
Lebanon
were
of
pure
gold:
none
were
of
silver;
it
was
not
any
thing
accounted
of
in
the
days
of
Solomon.
009:021
For
the
king's
ships
went
to
Tarshish
with
the
servants
of
Huram:
every
three
years
once
came
the
ships
of
Tarshish
bringing
gold,
and
silver,
ivory,
and
apes,
and
peacocks.
009:022
And
king
Solomon
passed
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
in
riches
and
wisdom.
009:023
And
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
sought
the
presence
of
Solomon,
to
hear
his
wisdom,
that
God
had
put
in
his
heart.
009:024
And
they
brought
every
man
his
present,
vessels
of
silver,
and
vessels
of
gold,
and
raiment,
harness,
and
spices,
horses,
and
mules,
a
rate
year
by
year.
009:025
And
Solomon
had
four
thousand
stalls
for
horses
and
chariots,
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen;
whom
he
bestowed
in
the
chariot
cities,
and
with
the
king
at
Jerusalem.
009:026
And
he
reigned
over
all
the
kings
from
the
river
even
unto
the
land
of
the
Philistines,
and
to
the
border
of
Egypt.
009:027
And
the
king
made
silver
in
Jerusalem
as
stones,
and
cedar
trees
made
he
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in
the
low
plains
in
abundance.
009:028
And
they
brought
unto
Solomon
horses
out
of
Egypt,
and
out
of
all
lands.
009:029
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Solomon,
first
and
last,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
Nathan
the
prophet,
and
in
the
prophecy
of
Ahijah
the
Shilonite,
and
in
the
visions
of
Iddo
the
seer
against
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat?
009:030
And
Solomon
reigned
in
Jerusalem
over
all
Israel
forty
years.
009:031
And
Solomon
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
he
was
buried
in
the
city
of
David
his
father:
and
Rehoboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
010:001
And
Rehoboam
went
to
Shechem:
for
to
Shechem
were
all
Israel
come
to
make
him
king.
010:002
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
was
in
Egypt,
whither
he
fled
from
the
presence
of
Solomon
the
king,
heard
it,
that
Jeroboam
returned
out
of
Egypt.
010:003
And
they
sent
and
called
him.
So
Jeroboam
and
all
Israel
came
and
spake
to
Rehoboam,
saying,
010:004
Thy
father
made
our
yoke
grievous:
now
therefore
ease
thou
somewhat
the
grievous
servitude
of
thy
father,
and
his
heavy
yoke
that
he
put
upon
us,
and
we
will
serve
thee.
010:005
And
he
said
unto
them,
Come
again
unto
me
after
three
days.
And
the
people
departed.
010:006
And
king
Rehoboam
took
counsel
with
the
old
men
that
had
stood
before
Solomon
his
father
while
he
yet
lived,
saying,
What
counsel
give
ye
me
to
return
answer
to
this
people?
010:007
And
they
spake
unto
him,
saying,
If
thou
be
kind
to
this
people,
and
please
them,
and
speak
good
words
to
them,
they
will
be
thy
servants
for
ever.
010:008
But
he
forsook
the
counsel
which
the
old
men
gave
him,
and
took
counsel
with
the
young
men
that
were
brought
up
with
him,
that
stood
before
him.
010:009
And
he
said
unto
them,
What
advice
give
ye
that
we
may
return
answer
to
this
people,
which
have
spoken
to
me,
saying,
Ease
somewhat
the
yoke
that
thy
father
did
put
upon
us?
010:010
And
the
young
men
that
were
brought
up
with
him
spake
unto
him,
saying,
Thus
shalt
thou
answer
the
people
that
spake
unto
thee,
saying,
Thy
father
made
our
yoke
heavy,
but
make
thou
it
somewhat
lighter
for
us;
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
them,
My
little
finger
shall
be
thicker
than
my
father's
loins.
010:011
For
whereas
my
father
put
a
heavy
yoke
upon
you,
I
will
put
more
to
your
yoke:
my
father
chastised
you
with
whips,
but
I
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions.
010:012
So
Jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
Rehoboam
on
the
third
day,
as
the
king
bade,
saying,
Come
again
to
me
on
the
third
day.
010:013
And
the
king
answered
them
roughly;
and
king
Rehoboam
forsook
the
counsel
of
the
old
men,
010:014
And
answered
them
after
the
advice
of
the
young
men,
saying,
My
father
made
your
yoke
heavy,
but
I
will
add
thereto:
my
father
chastised
you
with
whips,
but
I
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions.
010:015
So
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
people:
for
the
cause
was
of
God,
that
the
LORD
might
perform
his
word,
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
to
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat.
010:016
And
when
all
Israel
saw
that
the
king
would
not
hearken
unto
them,
the
people
answered
the
king,
saying,
What
portion
have
we
in
David?
and
we
have
none
inheritance
in
the
son
of
Jesse:
every
man
to
your
tents,
O
Israel:
and
now,
David,
see
to
thine
own
house.
So
all
Israel
went
to
their
tents.
010:017
But
as
for
the
children
of
Israel
that
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
Judah,
Rehoboam
reigned
over
them.
010:018
Then
king
Rehoboam
sent
Hadoram
that
was
over
the
tribute;
and
the
children
of
Israel
stoned
him
with
stones,
that
he
died.
But
king
Rehoboam
made
speed
to
get
him
up
to
his
chariot,
to
flee
to
Jerusalem.
010:019
And
Israel
rebelled
against
the
house
of
David
unto
this
day.
011:001
And
when
Rehoboam
was
come
to
Jerusalem,
he
gathered
of
the
house
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
chosen
men,
which
were
warriors,
to
fight
against
Israel,
that
he
might
bring
the
kingdom
again
to
Rehoboam.
011:002
But
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Shemaiah
the
man
of
God,
saying,
011:003
Speak
unto
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon,
king
of
Judah,
and
to
all
Israel
in
Judah
and
Benjamin,
saying,
011:004
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Ye
shall
not
go
up,
nor
fight
against
your
brethren:
return
every
man
to
his
house:
for
this
thing
is
done
of
me.
And
they
obeyed
the
words
of
the
LORD,
and
returned
from
going
against
Jeroboam.
011:005
And
Rehoboam
dwelt
in
Jerusalem,
and
built
cities
for
defence
in
Judah.
011:006
He
built
even
Bethlehem,
and
Etam,
and
Tekoa,
011:007
And
Bethzur,
and
Shoco,
and
Adullam,
011:008
And
Gath,
and
Mareshah,
and
Ziph,
011:009
And
Adoraim,
and
Lachish,
and
Azekah,
011:010
And
Zorah,
and
Aijalon,
and
Hebron,
which
are
in
Judah
and
in
Benjamin
fenced
cities.
011:011
And
he
fortified
the
strong
holds,
and
put
captains
in
them,
and
store
of
victual,
and
of
oil
and
wine.
011:012
And
in
every
several
city
he
put
shields
and
spears,
and
made
them
exceeding
strong,
having
Judah
and
Benjamin
on
his
side.
011:013
And
the
priests
and
the
Levites
that
were
in
all
Israel
resorted
to
him
out
of
all
their
coasts.
011:014
For
the
Levites
left
their
suburbs
and
their
possession,
and
came
to
Judah
and
Jerusalem:
for
Jeroboam
and
his
sons
had
cast
them
off
from
executing
the
priest's
office
unto
the
LORD:
011:015
And
he
ordained
him
priests
for
the
high
places,
and
for
the
devils,
and
for
the
calves
which
he
had
made.
011:016
And
after
them
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
such
as
set
their
hearts
to
seek
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
came
to
Jerusalem,
to
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers.
011:017
So
they
strengthened
the
kingdom
of
Judah,
and
made
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
strong,
three
years:
for
three
years
they
walked
in
the
way
of
David
and
Solomon.
011:018
And
Rehoboam
took
him
Mahalath
the
daughter
of
Jerimoth
the
son
of
David
to
wife,
and
Abihail
the
daughter
of
Eliab
the
son
of
Jesse;
011:019
Which
bare
him
children;
Jeush,
and
Shamariah,
and
Zaham.
011:020
And
after
her
he
took
Maachah
the
daughter
of
Absalom;
which
bare
him
Abijah,
and
Attai,
and
Ziza,
and
Shelomith.
011:021
And
Rehoboam
loved
Maachah
the
daughter
of
Absalom
above
all
his
wives
and
his
concubines:
(for
he
took
eighteen
wives,
and
threescore
concubines;
and
begat
twenty
and
eight
sons,
and
threescore
daughters.)
011:022
And
Rehoboam
made
Abijah
the
son
of
Maachah
the
chief,
to
be
ruler
among
his
brethren:
for
he
thought
to
make
him
king.
011:023
And
he
dealt
wisely,
and
dispersed
of
all
his
children
throughout
all
the
countries
of
Judah
and
Benjamin,
unto
every
fenced
city:
and
he
gave
them
victual
in
abundance.
And
he
desired
many
wives.
012:001
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Rehoboam
had
established
the
kingdom,
and
had
strengthened
himself,
he
forsook
the
law
of
the
LORD,
and
all
Israel
with
him.
012:002
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
in
the
fifth
year
of
king
Rehoboam
Shishak
king
of
Egypt
came
up
against
Jerusalem,
because
they
had
transgressed
against
the
LORD,
012:003
With
twelve
hundred
chariots,
and
threescore
thousand
horsemen:
and
the
people
were
without
number
that
came
with
him
out
of
Egypt;
the
Lubims,
the
Sukkiims,
and
the
Ethiopians.
012:004
And
he
took
the
fenced
cities
which
pertained
to
Judah,
and
came
to
Jerusalem.
012:005
Then
came
Shemaiah
the
prophet
to
Rehoboam,
and
to
the
princes
of
Judah,
that
were
gathered
together
to
Jerusalem
because
of
Shishak,
and
said
unto
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Ye
have
forsaken
me,
and
therefore
have
I
also
left
you
in
the
hand
of
Shishak.
012:006
Whereupon
the
princes
of
Israel
and
the
king
humbled
themselves;
and
they
said,
The
LORD
is
righteous.
012:007
And
when
the
LORD
saw
that
they
humbled
themselves,
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Shemaiah,
saying,
They
have
humbled
themselves;
therefore
I
will
not
destroy
them,
but
I
will
grant
them
some
deliverance;
and
my
wrath
shall
not
be
poured
out
upon
Jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
Shishak.
012:008
Nevertheless
they
shall
be
his
servants;
that
they
may
know
my
service,
and
the
service
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
countries.
012:009
So
Shishak
king
of
Egypt
came
up
against
Jerusalem,
and
took
away
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house;
he
took
all:
he
carried
away
also
the
shields
of
gold
which
Solomon
had
made.
012:010
Instead
of
which
king
Rehoboam
made
shields
of
brass,
and
committed
them
to
the
hands
of
the
chief
of
the
guard,
that
kept
the
entrance
of
the
king's
house.
012:011
And
when
the
king
entered
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
the
guard
came
and
fetched
them,
and
brought
them
again
into
the
guard
chamber.
012:012
And
when
he
humbled
himself,
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
turned
from
him,
that
he
would
not
destroy
him
altogether:
and
also
in
Judah
things
went
well.
012:013
So
king
Rehoboam
strengthened
himself
in
Jerusalem,
and
reigned:
for
Rehoboam
was
one
and
forty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
seventeen
years
in
Jerusalem,
the
city
which
the
LORD
had
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
to
put
his
name
there.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Naamah
an
Ammonitess.
012:014
And
he
did
evil,
because
he
prepared
not
his
heart
to
seek
the
LORD.
012:015
Now
the
acts
of
Rehoboam,
first
and
last,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
Shemaiah
the
prophet,
and
of
Iddo
the
seer
concerning
genealogies?
And
there
were
wars
between
Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
continually.
012:016
And
Rehoboam
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
David:
and
Abijah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
013:001
Now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
Jeroboam
began
Abijah
to
reign
over
Judah.
013:002
He
reigned
three
years
in
Jerusalem.
His
mother's
name
also
was
Michaiah
the
daughter
of
Uriel
of
Gibeah.
And
there
was
war
between
Abijah
and
Jeroboam.
013:003
And
Abijah
set
the
battle
in
array
with
an
army
of
valiant
men
of
war,
even
four
hundred
thousand
chosen
men:
Jeroboam
also
set
the
battle
in
array
against
him
with
eight
hundred
thousand
chosen
men,
being
mighty
men
of
valour.
013:004
And
Abijah
stood
up
upon
mount
Zemaraim,
which
is
in
mount
Ephraim,
and
said,
Hear
me,
thou
Jeroboam,
and
all
Israel;
013:005
Ought
ye
not
to
know
that
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
gave
the
kingdom
over
Israel
to
David
for
ever,
even
to
him
and
to
his
sons
by
a
covenant
of
salt?
013:006
Yet
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
the
servant
of
Solomon
the
son
of
David,
is
risen
up,
and
hath
rebelled
against
his
lord.
013:007
And
there
are
gathered
unto
him
vain
men,
the
children
of
Belial,
and
have
strengthened
themselves
against
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon,
when
Rehoboam
was
young
and
tenderhearted,
and
could
not
withstand
them.
013:008
And
now
ye
think
to
withstand
the
kingdom
of
the
LORD
in
the
hand
of
the
sons
of
David;
and
ye
be
a
great
multitude,
and
there
are
with
your
golden
calves,
which
Jeroboam
made
you
for
gods.
013:009
Have
ye
not
cast
out
the
priests
of
the
LORD,
the
sons
of
Aaron,
and
the
Levites,
and
have
made
you
priests
after
the
manner
of
the
nations
of
other
lands?
so
that
whosoever
cometh
to
consecrate
himself
with
a
young
bullock
and
seven
rams,
the
same
may
be
a
priest
of
them
that
are
no
gods.
013:010
But
as
for
us,
the
LORD
is
our
God,
and
we
have
not
forsaken
him;
and
the
priests,
which
minister
unto
the
LORD,
are
the
sons
of
Aaron,
and
the
Levites
wait
upon
their
business:
013:011
And
they
burn
unto
the
LORD
every
morning
and
every
evening
burnt
sacrifices
and
sweet
incense:
the
shewbread
also
set
they
in
order
upon
the
pure
table;
and
the
candlestick
of
gold
with
the
lamps
thereof,
to
burn
every
evening:
for
we
keep
the
charge
of
the
LORD
our
God;
but
ye
have
forsaken
him.
013:012
And,
behold,
God
himself
is
with
us
for
our
captain,
and
his
priests
with
sounding
trumpets
to
cry
alarm
against
you.
O
children
of
Israel,
fight
ye
not
against
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers;
for
ye
shall
not
prosper.
013:013
But
Jeroboam
caused
an
ambushment
to
come
about
behind
them:
so
they
were
before
Judah,
and
the
ambushment
was
behind
them.
013:014
And
when
Judah
looked
back,
behold,
the
battle
was
before
and
behind:
and
they
cried
unto
the
LORD,
and
the
priests
sounded
with
the
trumpets.
013:015
Then
the
men
of
Judah
gave
a
shout:
and
as
the
men
of
Judah
shouted,
it
came
to
pass,
that
God
smote
Jeroboam
and
all
Israel
before
Abijah
and
Judah.
013:016
And
the
children
of
Israel
fled
before
Judah:
and
God
delivered
them
into
their
hand.
013:017
And
Abijah
and
his
people
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter:
so
there
fell
down
slain
of
Israel
five
hundred
thousand
chosen
men.
013:018
Thus
the
children
of
Israel
were
brought
under
at
that
time,
and
the
children
of
Judah
prevailed,
because
they
relied
upon
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers.
013:019
And
Abijah
pursued
after
Jeroboam,
and
took
cities
from
him,
Bethel
with
the
towns
thereof,
and
Jeshanah
with
the
towns
thereof,
and
Ephraim
with
the
towns
thereof.
013:020
Neither
did
Jeroboam
recover
strength
again
in
the
days
of
Abijah:
and
the
LORD
struck
him,
and
he
died.
013:021
But
Abijah
waxed
mighty,
and
married
fourteen
wives,
and
begat
twenty
and
two
sons,
and
sixteen
daughters.
013:022
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Abijah,
and
his
ways,
and
his
sayings,
are
written
in
the
story
of
the
prophet
Iddo.
014:001
So
Abijah
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
David:
and
Asa
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
In
his
days
the
land
was
quiet
ten
years.
014:002
And
Asa
did
that
which
was
good
and
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD
his
God:
014:003
For
he
took
away
the
altars
of
the
strange
gods,
and
the
high
places,
and
brake
down
the
images,
and
cut
down
the
groves:
014:004
And
commanded
Judah
to
seek
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers,
and
to
do
the
law
and
the
commandment.
014:005
Also
he
took
away
out
of
all
the
cities
of
Judah
the
high
places
and
the
images:
and
the
kingdom
was
quiet
before
him.
014:006
And
he
built
fenced
cities
in
Judah:
for
the
land
had
rest,
and
he
had
no
war
in
those
years;
because
the
LORD
had
given
him
rest.
014:007
Therefore
he
said
unto
Judah,
Let
us
build
these
cities,
and
make
about
them
walls,
and
towers,
gates,
and
bars,
while
the
land
is
yet
before
us;
because
we
have
sought
the
LORD
our
God,
we
have
sought
him,
and
he
hath
given
us
rest
on
every
side.
So
they
built
and
prospered.
014:008
And
Asa
had
an
army
of
men
that
bare
targets
and
spears,
out
of
Judah
three
hundred
thousand;
and
out
of
Benjamin,
that
bare
shields
and
drew
bows,
two
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand:
all
these
were
mighty
men
of
valour.
014:009
And
there
came
out
against
them
Zerah
the
Ethiopian
with
an
host
of
a
thousand
thousand,
and
three
hundred
chariots;
and
came
unto
Mareshah.
014:010
Then
Asa
went
out
against
him,
and
they
set
the
battle
in
array
in
the
valley
of
Zephathah
at
Mareshah.
014:011
And
Asa
cried
unto
the
LORD
his
God,
and
said,
LORD,
it
is
nothing
with
thee
to
help,
whether
with
many,
or
with
them
that
have
no
power:
help
us,
O
LORD
our
God;
for
we
rest
on
thee,
and
in
thy
name
we
go
against
this
multitude.
O
LORD,
thou
art
our
God;
let
no
man
prevail
against
thee.
014:012
So
the
LORD
smote
the
Ethiopians
before
Asa,
and
before
Judah;
and
the
Ethiopians
fled.
014:013
And
Asa
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
pursued
them
unto
Gerar:
and
the
Ethiopians
were
overthrown,
that
they
could
not
recover
themselves;
for
they
were
destroyed
before
the
LORD,
and
before
his
host;
and
they
carried
away
very
much
spoil.
014:014
And
