they
smote
all
the
cities
round
about
Gerar;
for
the
fear
of
the
LORD
came
upon
them:
and
they
spoiled
all
the
cities;
for
there
was
exceeding
much
spoil
in
them.
014:015
They
smote
also
the
tents
of
cattle,
and
carried
away
sheep
and
camels
in
abundance,
and
returned
to
Jerusalem.
015:001
And
the
Spirit
of
God
came
upon
Azariah
the
son
of
Oded:
015:002
And
he
went
out
to
meet
Asa,
and
said
unto
him,
Hear
ye
me,
Asa,
and
all
Judah
and
Benjamin;
The
LORD
is
with
you,
while
ye
be
with
him;
and
if
ye
seek
him,
he
will
be
found
of
you;
but
if
ye
forsake
him,
he
will
forsake
you.
015:003
Now
for
a
long
season
Israel
hath
been
without
the
true
God,
and
without
a
teaching
priest,
and
without
law.
015:004
But
when
they
in
their
trouble
did
turn
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
and
sought
him,
he
was
found
of
them.
015:005
And
in
those
times
there
was
no
peace
to
him
that
went
out,
nor
to
him
that
came
in,
but
great
vexations
were
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
countries.
015:006
And
nation
was
destroyed
of
nation,
and
city
of
city:
for
God
did
vex
them
with
all
adversity.
015:007
Be
ye
strong
therefore,
and
let
not
your
hands
be
weak:
for
your
work
shall
be
rewarded.
015:008
And
when
Asa
heard
these
words,
and
the
prophecy
of
Oded
the
prophet,
he
took
courage,
and
put
away
the
abominable
idols
out
of
all
the
land
of
Judah
and
Benjamin,
and
out
of
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
from
mount
Ephraim,
and
renewed
the
altar
of
the
LORD,
that
was
before
the
porch
of
the
LORD.
015:009
And
he
gathered
all
Judah
and
Benjamin,
and
the
strangers
with
them
out
of
Ephraim
and
Manasseh,
and
out
of
Simeon:
for
they
fell
to
him
out
of
Israel
in
abundance,
when
they
saw
that
the
LORD
his
God
was
with
him.
015:010
So
they
gathered
themselves
together
at
Jerusalem
in
the
third
month,
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
Asa.
015:011
And
they
offered
unto
the
LORD
the
same
time,
of
the
spoil
which
they
had
brought,
seven
hundred
oxen
and
seven
thousand
sheep.
015:012
And
they
entered
into
a
covenant
to
seek
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul;
015:013
That
whosoever
would
not
seek
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
should
be
put
to
death,
whether
small
or
great,
whether
man
or
woman.
015:014
And
they
sware
unto
the
LORD
with
a
loud
voice,
and
with
shouting,
and
with
trumpets,
and
with
cornets.
015:015
And
all
Judah
rejoiced
at
the
oath:
for
they
had
sworn
with
all
their
heart,
and
sought
him
with
their
whole
desire;
and
he
was
found
of
them:
and
the
LORD
gave
them
rest
round
about.
015:016
And
also
concerning
Maachah
the
mother
of
Asa
the
king,
he
removed
her
from
being
queen,
because
she
had
made
an
idol
in
a
grove:
and
Asa
cut
down
her
idol,
and
stamped
it,
and
burnt
it
at
the
brook
Kidron.
015:017
But
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
out
of
Israel:
nevertheless
the
heart
of
Asa
was
perfect
all
his
days.
015:018
And
he
brought
into
the
house
of
God
the
things
that
his
father
had
dedicated,
and
that
he
himself
had
dedicated,
silver,
and
gold,
and
vessels.
015:019
And
there
was
no
more
war
unto
the
five
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
Asa.
016:001
In
the
six
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
Asa
Baasha
king
of
Israel
came
up
against
Judah,
and
built
Ramah,
to
the
intent
that
he
might
let
none
go
out
or
come
in
to
Asa
king
of
Judah.
016:002
Then
Asa
brought
out
silver
and
gold
out
of
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
and
of
the
king's
house,
and
sent
to
Benhadad
king
of
Syria,
that
dwelt
at
Damascus,
saying,
016:003
There
is
a
league
between
me
and
thee,
as
there
was
between
my
father
and
thy
father:
behold,
I
have
sent
thee
silver
and
gold;
go,
break
thy
league
with
Baasha
king
of
Israel,
that
he
may
depart
from
me.
016:004
And
Benhadad
hearkened
unto
king
Asa,
and
sent
the
captains
of
his
armies
against
the
cities
of
Israel;
and
they
smote
Ijon,
and
Dan,
and
Abelmaim,
and
all
the
store
cities
of
Naphtali.
016:005
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
Baasha
heard
it,
that
he
left
off
building
of
Ramah,
and
let
his
work
cease.
016:006
Then
Asa
the
king
took
all
Judah;
and
they
carried
away
the
stones
of
Ramah,
and
the
timber
thereof,
wherewith
Baasha
was
building;
and
he
built
therewith
Geba
and
Mizpah.
016:007
And
at
that
time
Hanani
the
seer
came
to
Asa
king
of
Judah,
and
said
unto
him,
Because
thou
hast
relied
on
the
king
of
Syria,
and
not
relied
on
the
LORD
thy
God,
therefore
is
the
host
of
the
king
of
Syria
escaped
out
of
thine
hand.
016:008
Were
not
the
Ethiopians
and
the
Lubims
a
huge
host,
with
very
many
chariots
and
horsemen?
yet,
because
thou
didst
rely
on
the
LORD,
he
delivered
them
into
thine
hand.
016:009
For
the
eyes
of
the
LORD
run
to
and
fro
throughout
the
whole
earth,
to
shew
himself
strong
in
the
behalf
of
them
whose
heart
is
perfect
toward
him.
Herein
thou
hast
done
foolishly:
therefore
from
henceforth
thou
shalt
have
wars.
016:010
Then
Asa
was
wroth
with
the
seer,
and
put
him
in
a
prison
house;
for
he
was
in
a
rage
with
him
because
of
this
thing.
And
Asa
oppressed
some
of
the
people
the
same
time.
016:011
And,
behold,
the
acts
of
Asa,
first
and
last,
lo,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Judah
and
Israel.
016:012
And
Asa
in
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
his
reign
was
diseased
in
his
feet,
until
his
disease
was
exceeding
great:
yet
in
his
disease
he
sought
not
to
the
LORD,
but
to
the
physicians.
016:013
And
Asa
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
died
in
the
one
and
fortieth
year
of
his
reign.
016:014
And
they
buried
him
in
his
own
sepulchres,
which
he
had
made
for
himself
in
the
city
of
David,
and
laid
him
in
the
bed
which
was
filled
with
sweet
odours
and
divers
kinds
of
spices
prepared
by
the
apothecaries'
art:
and
they
made
a
very
great
burning
for
him.
017:001
And
Jehoshaphat
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead,
and
strengthened
himself
against
Israel.
017:002
And
he
placed
forces
in
all
the
fenced
cities
of
Judah,
and
set
garrisons
in
the
land
of
Judah,
and
in
the
cities
of
Ephraim,
which
Asa
his
father
had
taken.
017:003
And
the
LORD
was
with
Jehoshaphat,
because
he
walked
in
the
first
ways
of
his
father
David,
and
sought
not
unto
Baalim;
017:004
But
sought
to
the
Lord
God
of
his
father,
and
walked
in
his
commandments,
and
not
after
the
doings
of
Israel.
017:005
Therefore
the
LORD
stablished
the
kingdom
in
his
hand;
and
all
Judah
brought
to
Jehoshaphat
presents;
and
he
had
riches
and
honour
in
abundance.
017:006
And
his
heart
was
lifted
up
in
the
ways
of
the
LORD:
moreover
he
took
away
the
high
places
and
groves
out
of
Judah.
017:007
Also
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
he
sent
to
his
princes,
even
to
Benhail,
and
to
Obadiah,
and
to
Zechariah,
and
to
Nethaneel,
and
to
Michaiah,
to
teach
in
the
cities
of
Judah.
017:008
And
with
them
he
sent
Levites,
even
Shemaiah,
and
Nethaniah,
and
Zebadiah,
and
Asahel,
and
Shemiramoth,
and
Jehonathan,
and
Adonijah,
and
Tobijah,
and
Tobadonijah,
Levites;
and
with
them
Elishama
and
Jehoram,
priests.
017:009
And
they
taught
in
Judah,
and
had
the
book
of
the
law
of
the
LORD
with
them,
and
went
about
throughout
all
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
taught
the
people.
017:010
And
the
fear
of
the
LORD
fell
upon
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
lands
that
were
round
about
Judah,
so
that
they
made
no
war
against
Jehoshaphat.
017:011
Also
some
of
the
Philistines
brought
Jehoshaphat
presents,
and
tribute
silver;
and
the
Arabians
brought
him
flocks,
seven
thousand
and
seven
hundred
rams,
and
seven
thousand
and
seven
hundred
he
goats.
017:012
And
Jehoshaphat
waxed
great
exceedingly;
and
he
built
in
Judah
castles,
and
cities
of
store.
017:013
And
he
had
much
business
in
the
cities
of
Judah:
and
the
men
of
war,
mighty
men
of
valour,
were
in
Jerusalem.
017:014
And
these
are
the
numbers
of
them
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers:
Of
Judah,
the
captains
of
thousands;
Adnah
the
chief,
and
with
him
mighty
men
of
valour
three
hundred
thousand.
017:015
And
next
to
him
was
Jehohanan
the
captain,
and
with
him
two
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand.
017:016
And
next
him
was
Amasiah
the
son
of
Zichri,
who
willingly
offered
himself
unto
the
LORD;
and
with
him
two
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour.
017:017
And
of
Benjamin;
Eliada
a
mighty
man
of
valour,
and
with
him
armed
men
with
bow
and
shield
two
hundred
thousand.
017:018
And
next
him
was
Jehozabad,
and
with
him
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
ready
prepared
for
the
war.
017:019
These
waited
on
the
king,
beside
those
whom
the
king
put
in
the
fenced
cities
throughout
all
Judah.
018:001
Now
Jehoshaphat
had
riches
and
honour
in
abundance,
and
joined
affinity
with
Ahab.
018:002
And
after
certain
years
he
went
down
to
Ahab
to
Samaria.
And
Ahab
killed
sheep
and
oxen
for
him
in
abundance,
and
for
the
people
that
he
had
with
him,
and
persuaded
him
to
go
up
with
him
to
Ramothgilead.
018:003
And
Ahab
king
of
Israel
said
unto
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Judah,
Wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
Ramothgilead?
And
he
answered
him,
I
am
as
thou
art,
and
my
people
as
thy
people;
and
we
will
be
with
thee
in
the
war.
018:004
And
Jehoshaphat
said
unto
the
king
of
Israel,
Enquire,
I
pray
thee,
at
the
word
of
the
LORD
to
day.
018:005
Therefore
the
king
of
Israel
gathered
together
of
prophets
four
hundred
men,
and
said
unto
them,
Shall
we
go
to
Ramothgilead
to
battle,
or
shall
I
forbear?
And
they
said,
Go
up;
for
God
will
deliver
it
into
the
king's
hand.
018:006
But
Jehoshaphat
said,
Is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
LORD
besides,
that
we
might
enquire
of
him?
018:007
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
Jehoshaphat,
There
is
yet
one
man,
by
whom
we
may
enquire
of
the
LORD:
but
I
hate
him;
for
he
never
prophesied
good
unto
me,
but
always
evil:
the
same
is
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imla.
And
Jehoshaphat
said,
Let
not
the
king
say
so.
018:008
And
the
king
of
Israel
called
for
one
of
his
officers,
and
said,
Fetch
quickly
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imla.
018:009
And
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Judah
sat
either
of
them
on
his
throne,
clothed
in
their
robes,
and
they
sat
in
a
void
place
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
of
Samaria;
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
before
them.
018:010
And
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
had
made
him
horns
of
iron,
and
said,
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
With
these
thou
shalt
push
Syria
until
they
be
consumed.
018:011
And
all
the
prophets
prophesied
so,
saying,
Go
up
to
Ramothgilead,
and
prosper:
for
the
LORD
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king.
018:012
And
the
messenger
that
went
to
call
Micaiah
spake
to
him,
saying,
Behold,
the
words
of
the
prophets
declare
good
to
the
king
with
one
assent;
let
thy
word
therefore,
I
pray
thee,
be
like
one
of
their's,
and
speak
thou
good.
018:013
And
Micaiah
said,
As
the
LORD
liveth,
even
what
my
God
saith,
that
will
I
speak.
018:014
And
when
he
was
come
to
the
king,
the
king
said
unto
him,
Micaiah,
shall
we
go
to
Ramothgilead
to
battle,
or
shall
I
forbear?
And
he
said,
Go
ye
up,
and
prosper,
and
they
shall
be
delivered
into
your
hand.
018:015
And
the
king
said
to
him,
How
many
times
shall
I
adjure
thee
that
thou
say
nothing
but
the
truth
to
me
in
the
name
of
the
LORD?
018:016
Then
he
said,
I
did
see
all
Israel
scattered
upon
the
mountains,
as
sheep
that
have
no
shepherd:
and
the
LORD
said,
These
have
no
master;
let
them
return
therefore
every
man
to
his
house
in
peace.
018:017
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
to
Jehoshaphat,
Did
I
not
tell
thee
that
he
would
not
prophesy
good
unto
me,
but
evil?
018:018
Again
he
said,
Therefore
hear
the
word
of
the
LORD;
I
saw
the
LORD
sitting
upon
his
throne,
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
standing
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left.
018:019
And
the
LORD
said,
Who
shall
entice
Ahab
king
of
Israel,
that
he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
Ramothgilead?
And
one
spake
saying
after
this
manner,
and
another
saying
after
that
manner.
018:020
Then
there
came
out
a
spirit,
and
stood
before
the
LORD,
and
said,
I
will
entice
him.
And
the
LORD
said
unto
him,
Wherewith?
018:021
And
he
said,
I
will
go
out,
and
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets.
And
the
Lord
said,
Thou
shalt
entice
him,
and
thou
shalt
also
prevail:
go
out,
and
do
even
so.
018:022
Now
therefore,
behold,
the
LORD
hath
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
these
thy
prophets,
and
the
LORD
hath
spoken
evil
against
thee.
018:023
Then
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
came
near,
and
smote
Micaiah
upon
the
cheek,
and
said,
Which
way
went
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
from
me
to
speak
unto
thee?
018:024
And
Micaiah
said,
Behold,
thou
shalt
see
on
that
day
when
thou
shalt
go
into
an
inner
chamber
to
hide
thyself.
018:025
Then
the
king
of
Israel
said,
Take
ye
Micaiah,
and
carry
him
back
to
Amon
the
governor
of
the
city,
and
to
Joash
the
king's
son;
018:026
And
say,
Thus
saith
the
king,
Put
this
fellow
in
the
prison,
and
feed
him
with
bread
of
affliction
and
with
water
of
affliction,
until
I
return
in
peace.
018:027
And
Micaiah
said,
If
thou
certainly
return
in
peace,
then
hath
not
the
LORD
spoken
by
me.
And
he
said,
Hearken,
all
ye
people.
018:028
So
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
went
up
to
Ramothgilead.
018:029
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
Jehoshaphat,
I
will
disguise
myself,
and
I
will
go
to
the
battle;
but
put
thou
on
thy
robes.
So
the
king
of
Israel
disguised
himself;
and
they
went
to
the
battle.
018:030
Now
the
king
of
Syria
had
commanded
the
captains
of
the
chariots
that
were
with
him,
saying,
Fight
ye
not
with
small
or
great,
save
only
with
the
king
of
Israel.
018:031
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
saw
Jehoshaphat,
that
they
said,
It
is
the
king
of
Israel.
Therefore
they
compassed
about
him
to
fight:
but
Jehoshaphat
cried
out,
and
the
LORD
helped
him;
and
God
moved
them
to
depart
from
him.
018:032
For
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
perceived
that
it
was
not
the
king
of
Israel,
they
turned
back
again
from
pursuing
him.
018:033
And
a
certain
man
drew
a
bow
at
a
venture,
and
smote
the
king
of
Israel
between
the
joints
of
the
harness:
therefore
he
said
to
his
chariot
man,
Turn
thine
hand,
that
thou
mayest
carry
me
out
of
the
host;
for
I
am
wounded.
018:034
And
the
battle
increased
that
day:
howbeit
the
king
of
Israel
stayed
himself
up
in
his
chariot
against
the
Syrians
until
the
even:
and
about
the
time
of
the
sun
going
down
he
died.
019:001
And
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
returned
to
his
house
in
peace
to
Jerusalem.
019:002
And
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
the
seer
went
out
to
meet
him,
and
said
to
king
Jehoshaphat,
Shouldest
thou
help
the
ungodly,
and
love
them
that
hate
the
LORD?
therefore
is
wrath
upon
thee
from
before
the
LORD.
019:003
Nevertheless
there
are
good
things
found
in
thee,
in
that
thou
hast
taken
away
the
groves
out
of
the
land,
and
hast
prepared
thine
heart
to
seek
God.
019:004
And
Jehoshaphat
dwelt
at
Jerusalem:
and
he
went
out
again
through
the
people
from
Beersheba
to
mount
Ephraim,
and
brought
them
back
unto
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers.
019:005
And
he
set
judges
in
the
land
throughout
all
the
fenced
cities
of
Judah,
city
by
city,
019:006
And
said
to
the
judges,
Take
heed
what
ye
do:
for
ye
judge
not
for
man,
but
for
the
LORD,
who
is
with
you
in
the
judgment.
019:007
Wherefore
now
let
the
fear
of
the
LORD
be
upon
you;
take
heed
and
do
it:
for
there
is
no
iniquity
with
the
LORD
our
God,
nor
respect
of
persons,
nor
taking
of
gifts.
019:008
Moreover
in
Jerusalem
did
Jehoshaphat
set
of
the
Levites,
and
of
the
priests,
and
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
Israel,
for
the
judgment
of
the
LORD,
and
for
controversies,
when
they
returned
to
Jerusalem.
019:009
And
he
charged
them,
saying,
Thus
shall
ye
do
in
the
fear
of
the
LORD,
faithfully,
and
with
a
perfect
heart.
019:010
And
what
cause
soever
shall
come
to
you
of
your
brethren
that
dwell
in
your
cities,
between
blood
and
blood,
between
law
and
commandment,
statutes
and
judgments,
ye
shall
even
warn
them
that
they
trespass
not
against
the
LORD,
and
so
wrath
come
upon
you,
and
upon
your
brethren:
this
do,
and
ye
shall
not
trespass.
019:011
And,
behold,
Amariah
the
chief
priest
is
over
you
in
all
matters
of
the
LORD;
and
Zebadiah
the
son
of
Ishmael,
the
ruler
of
the
house
of
Judah,
for
all
the
king's
matters:
also
the
Levites
shall
be
officers
before
you.
Deal
courageously,
and
the
LORD
shall
be
with
the
good.
020:001
It
came
to
pass
after
this
also,
that
the
children
of
Moab,
and
the
children
of
Ammon,
and
with
them
other
beside
the
Ammonites,
came
against
Jehoshaphat
to
battle.
020:002
Then
there
came
some
that
told
Jehoshaphat,
saying,
There
cometh
a
great
multitude
against
thee
from
beyond
the
sea
on
this
side
Syria;
and,
behold,
they
be
in
Hazazontamar,
which
is
Engedi.
020:003
And
Jehoshaphat
feared,
and
set
himself
to
seek
the
LORD,
and
proclaimed
a
fast
throughout
all
Judah.
020:004
And
Judah
gathered
themselves
together,
to
ask
help
of
the
LORD:
even
out
of
all
the
cities
of
Judah
they
came
to
seek
the
LORD.
020:005
And
Jehoshaphat
stood
in
the
congregation
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
before
the
new
court,
020:006
And
said,
O
LORD
God
of
our
fathers,
art
not
thou
God
in
heaven?
and
rulest
not
thou
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
heathen?
and
in
thine
hand
is
there
not
power
and
might,
so
that
none
is
able
to
withstand
thee?
020:007
Art
not
thou
our
God,
who
didst
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
before
thy
people
Israel,
and
gavest
it
to
the
seed
of
Abraham
thy
friend
for
ever?
020:008
And
they
dwelt
therein,
and
have
built
thee
a
sanctuary
therein
for
thy
name,
saying,
020:009
If,
when
evil
cometh
upon
us,
as
the
sword,
judgment,
or
pestilence,
or
famine,
we
stand
before
this
house,
and
in
thy
presence,
(for
thy
name
is
in
this
house,)
and
cry
unto
thee
in
our
affliction,
then
thou
wilt
hear
and
help.
020:010
And
now,
behold,
the
children
of
Ammon
and
Moab
and
mount
Seir,
whom
thou
wouldest
not
let
Israel
invade,
when
they
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
but
they
turned
from
them,
and
destroyed
them
not;
020:011
Behold,
I
say,
how
they
reward
us,
to
come
to
cast
us
out
of
thy
possession,
which
thou
hast
given
us
to
inherit.
020:012
O
our
God,
wilt
thou
not
judge
them?
for
we
have
no
might
against
this
great
company
that
cometh
against
us;
neither
know
we
what
to
do:
but
our
eyes
are
upon
thee.
020:013
And
all
Judah
stood
before
the
LORD,
with
their
little
ones,
their
wives,
and
their
children.
020:014
Then
upon
Jahaziel
the
son
of
Zechariah,
the
son
of
Benaiah,
the
son
of
Jeiel,
the
son
of
Mattaniah,
a
Levite
of
the
sons
of
Asaph,
came
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation;
020:015
And
he
said,
Hearken
ye,
all
Judah,
and
ye
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
and
thou
king
Jehoshaphat,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
unto
you,
Be
not
afraid
nor
dismayed
by
reason
of
this
great
multitude;
for
the
battle
is
not
yours,
but
God's.
020:016
To
morrow
go
ye
down
against
them:
behold,
they
come
up
by
the
cliff
of
Ziz;
and
ye
shall
find
them
at
the
end
of
the
brook,
before
the
wilderness
of
Jeruel.
020:017
Ye
shall
not
need
to
fight
in
this
battle:
set
yourselves,
stand
ye
still,
and
see
the
salvation
of
the
LORD
with
you,
O
Judah
and
Jerusalem:
fear
not,
nor
be
dismayed;
to
morrow
go
out
against
them:
for
the
LORD
will
be
with
you.
020:018
And
Jehoshaphat
bowed
his
head
with
his
face
to
the
ground:
and
all
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
fell
before
the
LORD,
worshipping
the
LORD.
020:019
And
the
Levites,
of
the
children
of
the
Kohathites,
and
of
the
children
of
the
Korhites,
stood
up
to
praise
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
with
a
loud
voice
on
high.
020:020
And
they
rose
early
in
the
morning,
and
went
forth
into
the
wilderness
of
Tekoa:
and
as
they
went
forth,
Jehoshaphat
stood
and
said,
Hear
me,
O
Judah,
and
ye
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem;
Believe
in
the
LORD
your
God,
so
shall
ye
be
established;
believe
his
prophets,
so
shall
ye
prosper.
020:021
And
when
he
had
consulted
with
the
people,
he
appointed
singers
unto
the
LORD,
and
that
should
praise
the
beauty
of
holiness,
as
they
went
out
before
the
army,
and
to
say,
Praise
the
LORD;
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever.
020:022
And
when
they
began
to
sing
and
to
praise,
the
LORD
set
ambushments
against
the
children
of
Ammon,
Moab,
and
mount
Seir,
which
were
come
against
Judah;
and
they
were
smitten.
020:023
For
the
children
of
Ammon
and
Moab
stood
up
against
the
inhabitants
of
mount
Seir,
utterly
to
slay
and
destroy
them:
and
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
the
inhabitants
of
Seir,
every
one
helped
to
destroy
another.
020:024
And
when
Judah
came
toward
the
watch
tower
in
the
wilderness,
they
looked
unto
the
multitude,
and,
behold,
they
were
dead
bodies
fallen
to
the
earth,
and
none
escaped.
020:025
And
when
Jehoshaphat
and
his
people
came
to
take
away
the
spoil
of
them,
they
found
among
them
in
abundance
both
riches
with
the
dead
bodies,
and
precious
jewels,
which
they
stripped
off
for
themselves,
more
than
they
could
carry
away:
and
they
were
three
days
in
gathering
of
the
spoil,
it
was
so
much.
020:026
And
on
the
fourth
day
they
assembled
themselves
in
the
valley
of
Berachah;
for
there
they
blessed
the
LORD:
therefore
the
name
of
the
same
place
was
called,
The
valley
of
Berachah,
unto
this
day.
020:027
Then
they
returned,
every
man
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
and
Jehoshaphat
in
the
forefront
of
them,
to
go
again
to
Jerusalem
with
joy;
for
the
LORD
had
made
them
to
rejoice
over
their
enemies.
020:028
And
they
came
to
Jerusalem
with
psalteries
and
harps
and
trumpets
unto
the
house
of
the
LORD.
020:029
And
the
fear
of
God
was
on
all
the
kingdoms
of
those
countries,
when
they
had
heard
that
the
LORD
fought
against
the
enemies
of
Israel.
020:030
So
the
realm
of
Jehoshaphat
was
quiet:
for
his
God
gave
him
rest
round
about.
020:031
And
Jehoshaphat
reigned
over
Judah:
he
was
thirty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
five
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Azubah
the
daughter
of
Shilhi.
020:032
And
he
walked
in
the
way
of
Asa
his
father,
and
departed
not
from
it,
doing
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD.
020:033
Howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away:
for
as
yet
the
people
had
not
prepared
their
hearts
unto
the
God
of
their
fathers.
020:034
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jehoshaphat,
first
and
last,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
Jehu
