the
son
of
Hanani,
who
is
mentioned
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Israel.
020:035
And
after
this
did
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Judah
join
himself
with
Ahaziah
king
of
Israel,
who
did
very
wickedly:
020:036
And
he
joined
himself
with
him
to
make
ships
to
go
to
Tarshish:
and
they
made
the
ships
in
Eziongaber.
020:037
Then
Eliezer
the
son
of
Dodavah
of
Mareshah
prophesied
against
Jehoshaphat,
saying,
Because
thou
hast
joined
thyself
with
Ahaziah,
the
LORD
hath
broken
thy
works.
And
the
ships
were
broken,
that
they
were
not
able
to
go
to
Tarshish.
021:001
Now
Jehoshaphat
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
David.
And
Jehoram
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
021:002
And
he
had
brethren
the
sons
of
Jehoshaphat,
Azariah,
and
Jehiel,
and
Zechariah,
and
Azariah,
and
Michael,
and
Shephatiah:
all
these
were
the
sons
of
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Israel.
021:003
And
their
father
gave
them
great
gifts
of
silver,
and
of
gold,
and
of
precious
things,
with
fenced
cities
in
Judah:
but
the
kingdom
gave
he
to
Jehoram;
because
he
was
the
firstborn.
021:004
Now
when
Jehoram
was
risen
up
to
the
kingdom
of
his
father,
he
strengthened
himself,
and
slew
all
his
brethren
with
the
sword,
and
divers
also
of
the
princes
of
Israel.
021:005
Jehoram
was
thirty
and
two
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
eight
years
in
Jerusalem.
021:006
And
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
Israel,
like
as
did
the
house
of
Ahab:
for
he
had
the
daughter
of
Ahab
to
wife:
and
he
wrought
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD.
021:007
Howbeit
the
LORD
would
not
destroy
the
house
of
David,
because
of
the
covenant
that
he
had
made
with
David,
and
as
he
promised
to
give
a
light
to
him
and
to
his
sons
for
ever.
021:008
In
his
days
the
Edomites
revolted
from
under
the
dominion
of
Judah,
and
made
themselves
a
king.
021:009
Then
Jehoram
went
forth
with
his
princes,
and
all
his
chariots
with
him:
and
he
rose
up
by
night,
and
smote
the
Edomites
which
compassed
him
in,
and
the
captains
of
the
chariots.
021:010
So
the
Edomites
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
Judah
unto
this
day.
The
same
time
also
did
Libnah
revolt
from
under
his
hand;
because
he
had
forsaken
the
LORD
God
of
his
fathers.
021:011
Moreover
he
made
high
places
in
the
mountains
of
Judah
and
caused
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
to
commit
fornication,
and
compelled
Judah
thereto.
021:012
And
there
came
a
writing
to
him
from
Elijah
the
prophet,
saying,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
David
thy
father,
Because
thou
hast
not
walked
in
the
ways
of
Jehoshaphat
thy
father,
nor
in
the
ways
of
Asa
king
of
Judah,
021:013
But
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
Israel,
and
hast
made
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
to
go
a
whoring,
like
to
the
whoredoms
of
the
house
of
Ahab,
and
also
hast
slain
thy
brethren
of
thy
father's
house,
which
were
better
than
thyself:
021:014
Behold,
with
a
great
plague
will
the
LORD
smite
thy
people,
and
thy
children,
and
thy
wives,
and
all
thy
goods:
021:015
And
thou
shalt
have
great
sickness
by
disease
of
thy
bowels,
until
thy
bowels
fall
out
by
reason
of
the
sickness
day
by
day.
021:016
Moreover
the
LORD
stirred
up
against
Jehoram
the
spirit
of
the
Philistines,
and
of
the
Arabians,
that
were
near
the
Ethiopians:
021:017
And
they
came
up
into
Judah,
and
brake
into
it,
and
carried
away
all
the
substance
that
was
found
in
the
king's
house,
and
his
sons
also,
and
his
wives;
so
that
there
was
never
a
son
left
him,
save
Jehoahaz,
the
youngest
of
his
sons.
021:018
And
after
all
this
the
LORD
smote
him
in
his
bowels
with
an
incurable
disease.
021:019
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
in
process
of
time,
after
the
end
of
two
years,
his
bowels
fell
out
by
reason
of
his
sickness:
so
he
died
of
sore
diseases.
And
his
people
made
no
burning
for
him,
like
the
burning
of
his
fathers.
021:020
Thirty
and
two
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
in
Jerusalem
eight
years,
and
departed
without
being
desired.
Howbeit
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
David,
but
not
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings.
022:001
And
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
made
Ahaziah
his
youngest
son
king
in
his
stead:
for
the
band
of
men
that
came
with
the
Arabians
to
the
camp
had
slain
all
the
eldest.
So
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Jehoram
king
of
Judah
reigned.
022:002
Forty
and
two
years
old
was
Ahaziah
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
one
year
in
Jerusalem.
His
mother's
name
also
was
Athaliah
the
daughter
of
Omri.
022:003
He
also
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
house
of
Ahab:
for
his
mother
was
his
counsellor
to
do
wickedly.
022:004
Wherefore
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
like
the
house
of
Ahab:
for
they
were
his
counsellors
after
the
death
of
his
father
to
his
destruction.
022:005
He
walked
also
after
their
counsel,
and
went
with
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
king
of
Israel
to
war
against
Hazael
king
of
Syria
at
Ramothgilead:
and
the
Syrians
smote
Joram.
022:006
And
he
returned
to
be
healed
in
Jezreel
because
of
the
wounds
which
were
given
him
at
Ramah,
when
he
fought
with
Hazael
king
of
Syria.
And
Azariah
the
son
of
Jehoram
king
of
Judah
went
down
to
see
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
at
Jezreel,
because
he
was
sick.
022:007
And
the
destruction
of
Ahaziah
was
of
God
by
coming
to
Joram:
for
when
he
was
come,
he
went
out
with
Jehoram
against
Jehu
the
son
of
Nimshi,
whom
the
LORD
had
anointed
to
cut
off
the
house
of
Ahab.
022:008
And
it
came
to
pass,
that,
when
Jehu
was
executing
judgment
upon
the
house
of
Ahab,
and
found
the
princes
of
Judah,
and
the
sons
of
the
brethren
of
Ahaziah,
that
ministered
to
Ahaziah,
he
slew
them.
022:009
And
he
sought
Ahaziah:
and
they
caught
him,
(for
he
was
hid
in
Samaria,)
and
brought
him
to
Jehu:
and
when
they
had
slain
him,
they
buried
him:
Because,
said
they,
he
is
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat,
who
sought
the
LORD
with
all
his
heart.
So
the
house
of
Ahaziah
had
no
power
to
keep
still
the
kingdom.
022:010
But
when
Athaliah
the
mother
of
Ahaziah
saw
that
her
son
was
dead,
she
arose
and
destroyed
all
the
seed
royal
of
the
house
of
Judah.
022:011
But
Jehoshabeath,
the
daughter
of
the
king,
took
Joash
the
son
of
Ahaziah,
and
stole
him
from
among
the
king's
sons
that
were
slain,
and
put
him
and
his
nurse
in
a
bedchamber.
So
Jehoshabeath,
the
daughter
of
king
Jehoram,
the
wife
of
Jehoiada
the
priest,
(for
she
was
the
sister
of
Ahaziah,)
hid
him
from
Athaliah,
so
that
she
slew
him
not.
022:012
And
he
was
with
them
hid
in
the
house
of
God
six
years:
and
Athaliah
reigned
over
the
land.
023:001
And
in
the
seventh
year
Jehoiada
strengthened
himself,
and
took
the
captains
of
hundreds,
Azariah
the
son
of
Jeroham,
and
Ishmael
the
son
of
Jehohanan,
and
Azariah
the
son
of
Obed,
and
Maaseiah
the
son
of
Adaiah,
and
Elishaphat
the
son
of
Zichri,
into
covenant
with
him.
023:002
And
they
went
about
in
Judah,
and
gathered
the
Levites
out
of
all
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
Israel,
and
they
came
to
Jerusalem.
023:003
And
all
the
congregation
made
a
covenant
with
the
king
in
the
house
of
God.
And
he
said
unto
them,
Behold,
the
king's
son
shall
reign,
as
the
LORD
hath
said
of
the
sons
of
David.
023:004
This
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do;
A
third
part
of
you
entering
on
the
sabbath,
of
the
priests
and
of
the
Levites,
shall
be
porters
of
the
doors;
023:005
And
a
third
part
shall
be
at
the
king's
house;
and
a
third
part
at
the
gate
of
the
foundation:
and
all
the
people
shall
be
in
the
courts
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
023:006
But
let
none
come
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
save
the
priests,
and
they
that
minister
of
the
Levites;
they
shall
go
in,
for
they
are
holy:
but
all
the
people
shall
keep
the
watch
of
the
LORD.
023:007
And
the
Levites
shall
compass
the
king
round
about,
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand;
and
whosoever
else
cometh
into
the
house,
he
shall
be
put
to
death:
but
be
ye
with
the
king
when
he
cometh
in,
and
when
he
goeth
out.
023:008
So
the
Levites
and
all
Judah
did
according
to
all
things
that
Jehoiada
the
priest
had
commanded,
and
took
every
man
his
men
that
were
to
come
in
on
the
sabbath,
with
them
that
were
to
go
out
on
the
sabbath:
for
Jehoiada
the
priest
dismissed
not
the
courses.
023:009
Moreover
Jehoiada
the
priest
delivered
to
the
captains
of
hundreds
spears,
and
bucklers,
and
shields,
that
had
been
king
David's,
which
were
in
the
house
of
God.
023:010
And
he
set
all
the
people,
every
man
having
his
weapon
in
his
hand,
from
the
right
side
of
the
temple
to
the
left
side
of
the
temple,
along
by
the
altar
and
the
temple,
by
the
king
round
about.
023:011
Then
they
brought
out
the
king's
son,
and
put
upon
him
the
crown,
and
gave
him
the
testimony,
and
made
him
king.
And
Jehoiada
and
his
sons
anointed
him,
and
said,
God
save
the
king.
023:012
Now
when
Athaliah
heard
the
noise
of
the
people
running
and
praising
the
king,
she
came
to
the
people
into
the
house
of
the
LORD:
023:013
And
she
looked,
and,
behold,
the
king
stood
at
his
pillar
at
the
entering
in,
and
the
princes
and
the
trumpets
by
the
king:
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced,
and
sounded
with
trumpets,
also
the
singers
with
instruments
of
musick,
and
such
as
taught
to
sing
praise.
Then
Athaliah
rent
her
clothes,
and
said,
Treason,
Treason.
023:014
Then
Jehoiada
the
priest
brought
out
the
captains
of
hundreds
that
were
set
over
the
host,
and
said
unto
them,
Have
her
forth
of
the
ranges:
and
whoso
followeth
her,
let
him
be
slain
with
the
sword.
For
the
priest
said,
Slay
her
not
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
023:015
So
they
laid
hands
on
her;
and
when
she
was
come
to
the
entering
of
the
horse
gate
by
the
king's
house,
they
slew
her
there.
023:016
And
Jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
him,
and
between
all
the
people,
and
between
the
king,
that
they
should
be
the
LORD's
people.
023:017
Then
all
the
people
went
to
the
house
of
Baal,
and
brake
it
down,
and
brake
his
altars
and
his
images
in
pieces,
and
slew
Mattan
the
priest
of
Baal
before
the
altars.
023:018
Also
Jehoiada
appointed
the
offices
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
by
the
hand
of
the
priests
the
Levites,
whom
David
had
distributed
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
to
offer
the
burnt
offerings
of
the
LORD,
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
Moses,
with
rejoicing
and
with
singing,
as
it
was
ordained
by
David.
023:019
And
he
set
the
porters
at
the
gates
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
that
none
which
was
unclean
in
any
thing
should
enter
in.
023:020
And
he
took
the
captains
of
hundreds,
and
the
nobles,
and
the
governors
of
the
people,
and
all
the
people
of
the
land,
and
brought
down
the
king
from
the
house
of
the
LORD:
and
they
came
through
the
high
gate
into
the
king's
house,
and
set
the
king
upon
the
throne
of
the
kingdom.
023:021
And
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced:
and
the
city
was
quiet,
after
that
they
had
slain
Athaliah
with
the
sword.
024:001
Joash
was
seven
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
forty
years
in
Jerusalem.
His
mother's
name
also
was
Zibiah
of
Beersheba.
024:002
And
Joash
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
all
the
days
of
Jehoiada
the
priest.
024:003
And
Jehoiada
took
for
him
two
wives;
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters.
024:004
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this,
that
Joash
was
minded
to
repair
the
house
of
the
LORD.
024:005
And
he
gathered
together
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
and
said
to
them,
Go
out
unto
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
gather
of
all
Israel
money
to
repair
the
house
of
your
God
from
year
to
year,
and
see
that
ye
hasten
the
matter.
Howbeit
the
Levites
hastened
it
not.
024:006
And
the
king
called
for
Jehoiada
the
chief,
and
said
unto
him,
Why
hast
thou
not
required
of
the
Levites
to
bring
in
out
of
Judah
and
out
of
Jerusalem
the
collection,
according
to
the
commandment
of
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD,
and
of
the
congregation
of
Israel,
for
the
tabernacle
of
witness?
024:007
For
the
sons
of
Athaliah,
that
wicked
woman,
had
broken
up
the
house
of
God;
and
also
all
the
dedicated
things
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
did
they
bestow
upon
Baalim.
024:008
And
at
the
king's
commandment
they
made
a
chest,
and
set
it
without
at
the
gate
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
024:009
And
they
made
a
proclamation
through
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
to
bring
in
to
the
LORD
the
collection
that
Moses
the
servant
of
God
laid
upon
Israel
in
the
wilderness.
024:010
And
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
rejoiced,
and
brought
in,
and
cast
into
the
chest,
until
they
had
made
an
end.
024:011
Now
it
came
to
pass,
that
at
what
time
the
chest
was
brought
unto
the
king's
office
by
the
hand
of
the
Levites,
and
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money,
the
king's
scribe
and
the
high
priest's
officer
came
and
emptied
the
chest,
and
took
it,
and
carried
it
to
his
place
again.
Thus
they
did
day
by
day,
and
gathered
money
in
abundance.
024:012
And
the
king
and
Jehoiada
gave
it
to
such
as
did
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
hired
masons
and
carpenters
to
repair
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
also
such
as
wrought
iron
and
brass
to
mend
the
house
of
the
LORD.
024:013
So
the
workmen
wrought,
and
the
work
was
perfected
by
them,
and
they
set
the
house
of
God
in
his
state,
and
strengthened
it.
024:014
And
when
they
had
finished
it,
they
brought
the
rest
of
the
money
before
the
king
and
Jehoiada,
whereof
were
made
vessels
for
the
house
of
the
LORD,
even
vessels
to
minister,
and
to
offer
withal,
and
spoons,
and
vessels
of
gold
and
silver.
And
they
offered
burnt
offerings
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
continually
all
the
days
of
Jehoiada.
024:015
But
Jehoiada
waxed
old,
and
was
full
of
days
when
he
died;
an
hundred
and
thirty
years
old
was
he
when
he
died.
024:016
And
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
David
among
the
kings,
because
he
had
done
good
in
Israel,
both
toward
God,
and
toward
his
house.
024:017
Now
after
the
death
of
Jehoiada
came
the
princes
of
Judah,
and
made
obeisance
to
the
king.
Then
the
king
hearkened
unto
them.
024:018
And
they
left
the
house
of
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers,
and
served
groves
and
idols:
and
wrath
came
upon
Judah
and
Jerusalem
for
this
their
trespass.
024:019
Yet
he
sent
prophets
to
them,
to
bring
them
again
unto
the
LORD;
and
they
testified
against
them:
but
they
would
not
give
ear.
024:020
And
the
Spirit
of
God
came
upon
Zechariah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
the
priest,
which
stood
above
the
people,
and
said
unto
them,
Thus
saith
God,
Why
transgress
ye
the
commandments
of
the
LORD,
that
ye
cannot
prosper?
because
ye
have
forsaken
the
LORD,
he
hath
also
forsaken
you.
024:021
And
they
conspired
against
him,
and
stoned
him
with
stones
at
the
commandment
of
the
king
in
the
court
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
024:022
Thus
Joash
the
king
remembered
not
the
kindness
which
Jehoiada
his
father
had
done
to
him,
but
slew
his
son.
And
when
he
died,
he
said,
The
LORD
look
upon
it,
and
require
it.
024:023
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
the
year,
that
the
host
of
Syria
came
up
against
him:
and
they
came
to
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
and
destroyed
all
the
princes
of
the
people
from
among
the
people,
and
sent
all
the
spoil
of
them
unto
the
king
of
Damascus.
024:024
For
the
army
of
the
Syrians
came
with
a
small
company
of
men,
and
the
LORD
delivered
a
very
great
host
into
their
hand,
because
they
had
forsaken
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers.
So
they
executed
judgment
against
Joash.
024:025
And
when
they
were
departed
from
him,
(for
they
left
him
in
great
diseases,)
his
own
servants
conspired
against
him
for
the
blood
of
the
sons
of
Jehoiada
the
priest,
and
slew
him
on
his
bed,
and
he
died:
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
David,
but
they
buried
him
not
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings.
024:026
And
these
are
they
that
conspired
against
him;
Zabad
the
son
of
Shimeath
an
Ammonitess,
and
Jehozabad
the
son
of
Shimrith
a
Moabitess.
024:027
Now
concerning
his
sons,
and
the
greatness
of
the
burdens
laid
upon
him,
and
the
repairing
of
the
house
of
God,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
story
of
the
book
of
the
kings.
And
Amaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
025:001
Amaziah
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Jehoaddan
of
Jerusalem.
025:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
but
not
with
a
perfect
heart.
025:003
Now
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
kingdom
was
established
to
him,
that
he
slew
his
servants
that
had
killed
the
king
his
father.
025:004
But
he
slew
not
their
children,
but
did
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
in
the
book
of
Moses,
where
the
LORD
commanded,
saying,
The
fathers
shall
not
die
for
the
children,
neither
shall
the
children
die
for
the
fathers,
but
every
man
shall
die
for
his
own
sin.
025:005
Moreover
Amaziah
gathered
Judah
together,
and
made
them
captains
over
thousands,
and
captains
over
hundreds,
according
to
the
houses
of
their
fathers,
throughout
all
Judah
and
Benjamin:
and
he
numbered
them
from
twenty
years
old
and
above,
and
found
them
three
hundred
thousand
choice
men,
able
to
go
forth
to
war,
that
could
handle
spear
and
shield.
025:006
He
hired
also
an
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
out
of
Israel
for
an
hundred
talents
of
silver.
025:007
But
there
came
a
man
of
God
to
him,
saying,
O
king,
let
not
the
army
of
Israel
go
with
thee;
for
the
LORD
is
not
with
Israel,
to
wit,
with
all
the
children
of
Ephraim.
025:008
But
if
thou
wilt
go,
do
it;
be
strong
for
the
battle:
God
shall
make
thee
fall
before
the
enemy:
for
God
hath
power
to
help,
and
to
cast
down.
025:009
And
Amaziah
said
to
the
man
of
God,
But
what
shall
we
do
for
the
hundred
talents
which
I
have
given
to
the
army
of
Israel?
And
the
man
of
God
answered,
The
LORD
is
able
to
give
thee
much
more
than
this.
025:010
Then
Amaziah
separated
them,
to
wit,
the
army
that
was
come
to
him
out
of
Ephraim,
to
go
home
again:
wherefore
their
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
Judah,
and
they
returned
home
in
great
anger.
025:011
And
Amaziah
strengthened
himself,
and
led
forth
his
people,
and
went
to
the
valley
of
salt,
and
smote
of
the
children
of
Seir
ten
thousand.
025:012
And
other
ten
thousand
left
alive
did
the
children
of
Judah
carry
away
captive,
and
brought
them
unto
the
top
of
the
rock,
and
cast
them
down
from
the
top
of
the
rock,
that
they
all
were
broken
in
pieces.
025:013
But
the
soldiers
of
the
army
which
Amaziah
sent
back,
that
they
should
not
go
with
him
to
battle,
fell
upon
the
cities
of
Judah,
from
Samaria
even
unto
Bethhoron,
and
smote
three
thousand
of
them,
and
took
much
spoil.
025:014
Now
it
came
to
pass,
after
that
Amaziah
was
come
from
the
slaughter
of
the
Edomites,
that
he
brought
the
gods
of
the
children
of
Seir,
and
set
them
up
to
be
his
gods,
and
bowed
down
himself
before
them,
and
burned
incense
unto
them.
025:015
Wherefore
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Amaziah,
and
he
sent
unto
him
a
prophet,
which
said
unto
him,
Why
hast
thou
sought
after
the
gods
of
the
people,
which
could
not
deliver
their
own
people
out
of
thine
hand?
025:016
And
it
came
to
pass,
as
he
talked
with
him,
that
the
king
said
unto
him,
Art
thou
made
of
the
king's
counsel?
forbear;
why
shouldest
thou
be
smitten?
Then
the
prophet
forbare,
and
said,
I
know
that
God
hath
determined
to
destroy
thee,
because
thou
hast
done
this,
and
hast
not
hearkened
unto
my
counsel.
025:017
Then
Amaziah
king
of
Judah
took
advice,
and
sent
to
Joash,
the
son
of
Jehoahaz,
the
son
of
Jehu,
king
of
Israel,
saying,
Come,
let
us
see
one
another
in
the
face.
025:018
And
Joash
king
of
Israel
sent
to
Amaziah
king
of
Judah,
saying,
The
thistle
that
was
in
Lebanon
sent
to
the
cedar
that
was
in
Lebanon,
saying,
Give
thy
daughter
to
my
son
to
wife:
and
there
passed
by
a
wild
beast
that
was
in
Lebanon,
and
trode
down
the
thistle.
025:019
Thou
sayest,
Lo,
thou
hast
smitten
the
Edomites;
and
thine
heart
lifteth
thee
up
to
boast:
abide
now
at
home;
why
shouldest
thou
meddle
to
thine
hurt,
that
thou
shouldest
fall,
even
thou,
and
Judah
with
thee?
025:020
But
Amaziah
would
not
hear;
for
it
came
of
God,
that
he
might
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies,
because
they
sought
after
the
gods
of
Edom.
025:021
So
Joash
the
king
of
Israel
went
up;
and
they
saw
one
another
in
the
face,
both
he
and
Amaziah
king
of
Judah,
at
Bethshemesh,
which
belongeth
to
Judah.
025:022
And
Judah
was
put
to
the
worse
before
Israel,
and
they
fled
every
man
to
his
tent.
025:023
And
Joash
the
king
of
Israel
took
Amaziah
king
of
Judah,
the
son
of
Joash,
the
son
of
Jehoahaz,
at
Bethshemesh,
and
brought
him
to
Jerusalem,
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
from
the
gate
of
Ephraim
to
the
corner
gate,
four
hundred
cubits.
025:024
And
he
took
all
the
gold
and
the
silver,
and
all
the
vessels
that
were
found
in
the
house
of
God
with
Obededom,
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house,
the
hostages
also,
and
returned
to
Samaria.
025:025
And
Amaziah
the
son
of
Joash
king
of
Judah
lived
after
the
death
of
Joash
son
of
Jehoahaz
king
of
Israel
fifteen
years.
025:026
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Amaziah,
first
and
last,
behold,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Judah
and
Israel?
025:027
Now
after
the
time
that
Amaziah
did
turn
away
from
following
the
LORD
they
made
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
Jerusalem;
and
he
fled
to
Lachish:
but
they
sent
to
Lachish
after
him,
and
slew
him
there.
025:028
And
they
brought
him
upon
horses,
and
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
Judah.
026:001
Then
all
the
people
of
Judah
took
Uzziah,
who
was
sixteen
years
old,
and
made
him
king
in
the
room
of
his
father
Amaziah.
026:002
He
built
Eloth,
and
restored
it
to
Judah,
after
that
the
king
slept
with
his
fathers.
026:003
Sixteen
years
old
was
Uzziah
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
fifty
and
two
years
in
Jerusalem.
His
mother's
name
also
was
Jecoliah
of
Jerusalem.
026:004
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
his
father
Amaziah
did.
026:005
And
he
sought
God
in
the
days
of
Zechariah,
who
had
understanding
in
the
visions
of
God:
and
as
long
as
he
sought
the
LORD,
God
made
him
to
prosper.
026:006
And
he
went
forth
and
warred
against
the
Philistines,
and
