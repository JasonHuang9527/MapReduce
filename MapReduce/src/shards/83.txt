brake
down
the
wall
of
Gath,
and
the
wall
of
Jabneh,
and
the
wall
of
Ashdod,
and
built
cities
about
Ashdod,
and
among
the
Philistines.
026:007
And
God
helped
him
against
the
Philistines,
and
against
the
Arabians
that
dwelt
in
Gurbaal,
and
the
Mehunims.
026:008
And
the
Ammonites
gave
gifts
to
Uzziah:
and
his
name
spread
abroad
even
to
the
entering
in
of
Egypt;
for
he
strengthened
himself
exceedingly.
026:009
Moreover
Uzziah
built
towers
in
Jerusalem
at
the
corner
gate,
and
at
the
valley
gate,
and
at
the
turning
of
the
wall,
and
fortified
them.
026:010
Also
he
built
towers
in
the
desert,
and
digged
many
wells:
for
he
had
much
cattle,
both
in
the
low
country,
and
in
the
plains:
husbandmen
also,
and
vine
dressers
in
the
mountains,
and
in
Carmel:
for
he
loved
husbandry.
026:011
Moreover
Uzziah
had
an
host
of
fighting
men,
that
went
out
to
war
by
bands,
according
to
the
number
of
their
account
by
the
hand
of
Jeiel
the
scribe
and
Maaseiah
the
ruler,
under
the
hand
of
Hananiah,
one
of
the
king's
captains.
026:012
The
whole
number
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
mighty
men
of
valour
were
two
thousand
and
six
hundred.
026:013
And
under
their
hand
was
an
army,
three
hundred
thousand
and
seven
thousand
and
five
hundred,
that
made
war
with
mighty
power,
to
help
the
king
against
the
enemy.
026:014
And
Uzziah
prepared
for
them
throughout
all
the
host
shields,
and
spears,
and
helmets,
and
habergeons,
and
bows,
and
slings
to
cast
stones.
026:015
And
he
made
in
Jerusalem
engines,
invented
by
cunning
men,
to
be
on
the
towers
and
upon
the
bulwarks,
to
shoot
arrows
and
great
stones
withal.
And
his
name
spread
far
abroad;
for
he
was
marvellously
helped,
till
he
was
strong.
026:016
But
when
he
was
strong,
his
heart
was
lifted
up
to
his
destruction:
for
he
transgressed
against
the
LORD
his
God,
and
went
into
the
temple
of
the
LORD
to
burn
incense
upon
the
altar
of
incense.
026:017
And
Azariah
the
priest
went
in
after
him,
and
with
him
fourscore
priests
of
the
LORD,
that
were
valiant
men:
026:018
And
they
withstood
Uzziah
the
king,
and
said
unto
him,
It
appertaineth
not
unto
thee,
Uzziah,
to
burn
incense
unto
the
LORD,
but
to
the
priests
the
sons
of
Aaron,
that
are
consecrated
to
burn
incense:
go
out
of
the
sanctuary;
for
thou
hast
trespassed;
neither
shall
it
be
for
thine
honour
from
the
LORD
God.
026:019
Then
Uzziah
was
wroth,
and
had
a
censer
in
his
hand
to
burn
incense:
and
while
he
was
wroth
with
the
priests,
the
leprosy
even
rose
up
in
his
forehead
before
the
priests
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
from
beside
the
incense
altar.
026:020
And
Azariah
the
chief
priest,
and
all
the
priests,
looked
upon
him,
and,
behold,
he
was
leprous
in
his
forehead,
and
they
thrust
him
out
from
thence;
yea,
himself
hasted
also
to
go
out,
because
the
LORD
had
smitten
him.
026:021
And
Uzziah
the
king
was
a
leper
unto
the
day
of
his
death,
and
dwelt
in
a
several
house,
being
a
leper;
for
he
was
cut
off
from
the
house
of
the
LORD:
and
Jotham
his
son
was
over
the
king's
house,
judging
the
people
of
the
land.
026:022
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Uzziah,
first
and
last,
did
Isaiah
the
prophet,
the
son
of
Amoz,
write.
026:023
So
Uzziah
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
they
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
field
of
the
burial
which
belonged
to
the
kings;
for
they
said,
He
is
a
leper:
and
Jotham
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
027:001
Jotham
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
sixteen
years
in
Jerusalem.
His
mother's
name
also
was
Jerushah,
the
daughter
of
Zadok.
027:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
his
father
Uzziah
did:
howbeit
he
entered
not
into
the
temple
of
the
LORD.
And
the
people
did
yet
corruptly.
027:003
He
built
the
high
gate
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
on
the
wall
of
Ophel
he
built
much.
027:004
Moreover
he
built
cities
in
the
mountains
of
Judah,
and
in
the
forests
he
built
castles
and
towers.
027:005
He
fought
also
with
the
king
of
the
Ammonites,
and
prevailed
against
them.
And
the
children
of
Ammon
gave
him
the
same
year
an
hundred
talents
of
silver,
and
ten
thousand
measures
of
wheat,
and
ten
thousand
of
barley.
So
much
did
the
children
of
Ammon
pay
unto
him,
both
the
second
year,
and
the
third.
027:006
So
Jotham
became
mighty,
because
he
prepared
his
ways
before
the
LORD
his
God.
027:007
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jotham,
and
all
his
wars,
and
his
ways,
lo,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Israel
and
Judah.
027:008
He
was
five
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
reigned
sixteen
years
in
Jerusalem.
027:009
And
Jotham
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
David:
and
Ahaz
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
028:001
Ahaz
was
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
sixteen
years
in
Jerusalem:
but
he
did
not
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
like
David
his
father:
028:002
For
he
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
kings
of
Israel,
and
made
also
molten
images
for
Baalim.
028:003
Moreover
he
burnt
incense
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
and
burnt
his
children
in
the
fire,
after
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
whom
the
LORD
had
cast
out
before
the
children
of
Israel.
028:004
He
sacrificed
also
and
burnt
incense
in
the
high
places,
and
on
the
hills,
and
under
every
green
tree.
028:005
Wherefore
the
LORD
his
God
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Syria;
and
they
smote
him,
and
carried
away
a
great
multitude
of
them
captives,
and
brought
them
to
Damascus.
And
he
was
also
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Israel,
who
smote
him
with
a
great
slaughter.
028:006
For
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
slew
in
Judah
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
in
one
day,
which
were
all
valiant
men;
because
they
had
forsaken
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers.
028:007
And
Zichri,
a
mighty
man
of
Ephraim,
slew
Maaseiah
the
king's
son,
and
Azrikam
the
governor
of
the
house,
and
Elkanah
that
was
next
to
the
king.
028:008
And
the
children
of
Israel
carried
away
captive
of
their
brethren
two
hundred
thousand,
women,
sons,
and
daughters,
and
took
also
away
much
spoil
from
them,
and
brought
the
spoil
to
Samaria.
028:009
But
a
prophet
of
the
LORD
was
there,
whose
name
was
Oded:
and
he
went
out
before
the
host
that
came
to
Samaria,
and
said
unto
them,
Behold,
because
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers
was
wroth
with
Judah,
he
hath
delivered
them
into
your
hand,
and
ye
have
slain
them
in
a
rage
that
reacheth
up
unto
heaven.
028:010
And
now
ye
purpose
to
keep
under
the
children
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
unto
you:
but
are
there
not
with
you,
even
with
you,
sins
against
the
LORD
your
God?
028:011
Now
hear
me
therefore,
and
deliver
the
captives
again,
which
ye
have
taken
captive
of
your
brethren:
for
the
fierce
wrath
of
the
LORD
is
upon
you.
028:012
Then
certain
of
the
heads
of
the
children
of
Ephraim,
Azariah
the
son
of
Johanan,
Berechiah
the
son
of
Meshillemoth,
and
Jehizkiah
the
son
of
Shallum,
and
Amasa
the
son
of
Hadlai,
stood
up
against
them
that
came
from
the
war,
028:013
And
said
unto
them,
Ye
shall
not
bring
in
the
captives
hither:
for
whereas
we
have
offended
against
the
LORD
already,
ye
intend
to
add
more
to
our
sins
and
to
our
trespass:
for
our
trespass
is
great,
and
there
is
fierce
wrath
against
Israel.
028:014
So
the
armed
men
left
the
captives
and
the
spoil
before
the
princes
and
all
the
congregation.
028:015
And
the
men
which
were
expressed
by
name
rose
up,
and
took
the
captives,
and
with
the
spoil
clothed
all
that
were
naked
among
them,
and
arrayed
them,
and
shod
them,
and
gave
them
to
eat
and
to
drink,
and
anointed
them,
and
carried
all
the
feeble
of
them
upon
asses,
and
brought
them
to
Jericho,
the
city
of
palm
trees,
to
their
brethren:
then
they
returned
to
Samaria.
028:016
At
that
time
did
king
Ahaz
send
unto
the
kings
of
Assyria
to
help
him.
028:017
For
again
the
Edomites
had
come
and
smitten
Judah,
and
carried
away
captives.
028:018
The
Philistines
also
had
invaded
the
cities
of
the
low
country,
and
of
the
south
of
Judah,
and
had
taken
Bethshemesh,
and
Ajalon,
and
Gederoth,
and
Shocho
with
the
villages
thereof,
and
Timnah
with
the
villages
thereof,
Gimzo
also
and
the
villages
thereof:
and
they
dwelt
there.
028:019
For
the
LORD
brought
Judah
low
because
of
Ahaz
king
of
Israel;
for
he
made
Judah
naked,
and
transgressed
sore
against
the
LORD.
028:020
And
Tilgathpilneser
king
of
Assyria
came
unto
him,
and
distressed
him,
but
strengthened
him
not.
028:021
For
Ahaz
took
away
a
portion
out
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
out
of
the
house
of
the
king,
and
of
the
princes,
and
gave
it
unto
the
king
of
Assyria:
but
he
helped
him
not.
028:022
And
in
the
time
of
his
distress
did
he
trespass
yet
more
against
the
LORD:
this
is
that
king
Ahaz.
028:023
For
he
sacrificed
unto
the
gods
of
Damascus,
which
smote
him:
and
he
said,
Because
the
gods
of
the
kings
of
Syria
help
them,
therefore
will
I
sacrifice
to
them,
that
they
may
help
me.
But
they
were
the
ruin
of
him,
and
of
all
Israel.
028:024
And
Ahaz
gathered
together
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
God,
and
cut
in
pieces
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
God,
and
shut
up
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
he
made
him
altars
in
every
corner
of
Jerusalem.
028:025
And
in
every
several
city
of
Judah
he
made
high
places
to
burn
incense
unto
other
gods,
and
provoked
to
anger
the
LORD
God
of
his
fathers.
028:026
Now
the
rest
of
his
acts
and
of
all
his
ways,
first
and
last,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Judah
and
Israel.
028:027
And
Ahaz
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city,
even
in
Jerusalem:
but
they
brought
him
not
into
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
of
Israel:
and
Hezekiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
029:001
Hezekiah
began
to
reign
when
he
was
five
and
twenty
years
old,
and
he
reigned
nine
and
twenty
years
in
Jerusalem.
And
his
mother's
name
was
Abijah,
the
daughter
of
Zechariah.
029:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
according
to
all
that
David
his
father
had
done.
029:003
He
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign,
in
the
first
month,
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
repaired
them.
029:004
And
he
brought
in
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
and
gathered
them
together
into
the
east
street,
029:005
And
said
unto
them,
Hear
me,
ye
Levites,
sanctify
now
yourselves,
and
sanctify
the
house
of
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers,
and
carry
forth
the
filthiness
out
of
the
holy
place.
029:006
For
our
fathers
have
trespassed,
and
done
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD
our
God,
and
have
forsaken
him,
and
have
turned
away
their
faces
from
the
habitation
of
the
LORD,
and
turned
their
backs.
029:007
Also
they
have
shut
up
the
doors
of
the
porch,
and
put
out
the
lamps,
and
have
not
burned
incense
nor
offered
burnt
offerings
in
the
holy
place
unto
the
God
of
Israel.
029:008
Wherefore
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
was
upon
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
and
he
hath
delivered
them
to
trouble,
to
astonishment,
and
to
hissing,
as
ye
see
with
your
eyes.
029:009
For,
lo,
our
fathers
have
fallen
by
the
sword,
and
our
sons
and
our
daughters
and
our
wives
are
in
captivity
for
this.
029:010
Now
it
is
in
mine
heart
to
make
a
covenant
with
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
that
his
fierce
wrath
may
turn
away
from
us.
029:011
My
sons,
be
not
now
negligent:
for
the
LORD
hath
chosen
you
to
stand
before
him,
to
serve
him,
and
that
ye
should
minister
unto
him,
and
burn
incense.
029:012
Then
the
Levites
arose,
Mahath
the
son
of
Amasai,
and
Joel
the
son
of
Azariah,
of
the
sons
of
the
Kohathites:
and
of
the
sons
of
Merari,
Kish
the
son
of
Abdi,
and
Azariah
the
son
of
Jehalelel:
and
of
the
Gershonites;
Joah
the
son
of
Zimmah,
and
Eden
the
son
of
Joah:
029:013
And
of
the
sons
of
Elizaphan;
Shimri,
and
Jeiel:
and
of
the
sons
of
Asaph;
Zechariah,
and
Mattaniah:
029:014
And
of
the
sons
of
Heman;
Jehiel,
and
Shimei:
and
of
the
sons
of
Jeduthun;
Shemaiah,
and
Uzziel.
029:015
And
they
gathered
their
brethren,
and
sanctified
themselves,
and
came,
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
king,
by
the
words
of
the
LORD,
to
cleanse
the
house
of
the
LORD.
029:016
And
the
priests
went
into
the
inner
part
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
to
cleanse
it,
and
brought
out
all
the
uncleanness
that
they
found
in
the
temple
of
the
LORD
into
the
court
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
And
the
Levites
took
it,
to
carry
it
out
abroad
into
the
brook
Kidron.
029:017
Now
they
began
on
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
to
sanctify,
and
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
month
came
they
to
the
porch
of
the
LORD:
so
they
sanctified
the
house
of
the
LORD
in
eight
days;
and
in
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
first
month
they
made
an
end.
029:018
Then
they
went
in
to
Hezekiah
the
king,
and
said,
We
have
cleansed
all
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
the
altar
of
burnt
offering,
with
all
the
vessels
thereof,
and
the
shewbread
table,
with
all
the
vessels
thereof.
029:019
Moreover
all
the
vessels,
which
king
Ahaz
in
his
reign
did
cast
away
in
his
transgression,
have
we
prepared
and
sanctified,
and,
behold,
they
are
before
the
altar
of
the
LORD.
029:020
Then
Hezekiah
the
king
rose
early,
and
gathered
the
rulers
of
the
city,
and
went
up
to
the
house
of
the
LORD.
029:021
And
they
brought
seven
bullocks,
and
seven
rams,
and
seven
lambs,
and
seven
he
goats,
for
a
sin
offering
for
the
kingdom,
and
for
the
sanctuary,
and
for
Judah.
And
he
commanded
the
priests
the
sons
of
Aaron
to
offer
them
on
the
altar
of
the
LORD.
029:022
So
they
killed
the
bullocks,
and
the
priests
received
the
blood,
and
sprinkled
it
on
the
altar:
likewise,
when
they
had
killed
the
rams,
they
sprinkled
the
blood
upon
the
altar:
they
killed
also
the
lambs,
and
they
sprinkled
the
blood
upon
the
altar.
029:023
And
they
brought
forth
the
he
goats
for
the
sin
offering
before
the
king
and
the
congregation;
and
they
laid
their
hands
upon
them:
029:024
And
the
priests
killed
them,
and
they
made
reconciliation
with
their
blood
upon
the
altar,
to
make
an
atonement
for
all
Israel:
for
the
king
commanded
that
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sin
offering
should
be
made
for
all
Israel.
029:025
And
he
set
the
Levites
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
with
cymbals,
with
psalteries,
and
with
harps,
according
to
the
commandment
of
David,
and
of
Gad
the
king's
seer,
and
Nathan
the
prophet:
for
so
was
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
by
his
prophets.
029:026
And
the
Levites
stood
with
the
instruments
of
David,
and
the
priests
with
the
trumpets.
029:027
And
Hezekiah
commanded
to
offer
the
burnt
offering
upon
the
altar.
And
when
the
burnt
offering
began,
the
song
of
the
LORD
began
also
with
the
trumpets,
and
with
the
instruments
ordained
by
David
king
of
Israel.
029:028
And
all
the
congregation
worshipped,
and
the
singers
sang,
and
the
trumpeters
sounded:
and
all
this
continued
until
the
burnt
offering
was
finished.
029:029
And
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
offering,
the
king
and
all
that
were
present
with
him
bowed
themselves,
and
worshipped.
029:030
Moreover
Hezekiah
the
king
and
the
princes
commanded
the
Levites
to
sing
praise
unto
the
LORD
with
the
words
of
David,
and
of
Asaph
the
seer.
And
they
sang
praises
with
gladness,
and
they
bowed
their
heads
and
worshipped.
029:031
Then
Hezekiah
answered
and
said,
Now
ye
have
consecrated
yourselves
unto
the
LORD,
come
near
and
bring
sacrifices
and
thank
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
LORD.
And
the
congregation
brought
in
sacrifices
and
thank
offerings;
and
as
many
as
were
of
a
free
heart
burnt
offerings.
029:032
And
the
number
of
the
burnt
offerings,
which
the
congregation
brought,
was
threescore
and
ten
bullocks,
an
hundred
rams,
and
two
hundred
lambs:
all
these
were
for
a
burnt
offering
to
the
LORD.
029:033
And
the
consecrated
things
were
six
hundred
oxen
and
three
thousand
sheep.
029:034
But
the
priests
were
too
few,
so
that
they
could
not
flay
all
the
burnt
offerings:
wherefore
their
brethren
the
Levites
did
help
them,
till
the
work
was
ended,
and
until
the
other
priests
had
sanctified
themselves:
for
the
Levites
were
more
upright
in
heart
to
sanctify
themselves
than
the
priests.
029:035
And
also
the
burnt
offerings
were
in
abundance,
with
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings,
and
the
drink
offerings
for
every
burnt
offering.
So
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
was
set
in
order.
029:036
And
Hezekiah
rejoiced,
and
all
the
people,
that
God
had
prepared
the
people:
for
the
thing
was
done
suddenly.
030:001
And
Hezekiah
sent
to
all
Israel
and
Judah,
and
wrote
letters
also
to
Ephraim
and
Manasseh,
that
they
should
come
to
the
house
of
the
LORD
at
Jerusalem,
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
030:002
For
the
king
had
taken
counsel,
and
his
princes,
and
all
the
congregation
in
Jerusalem,
to
keep
the
passover
in
the
second
month.
030:003
For
they
could
not
keep
it
at
that
time,
because
the
priests
had
not
sanctified
themselves
sufficiently,
neither
had
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
to
Jerusalem.
030:004
And
the
thing
pleased
the
king
and
all
the
congregation.
030:005
So
they
established
a
decree
to
make
proclamation
throughout
all
Israel,
from
Beersheba
even
to
Dan,
that
they
should
come
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
at
Jerusalem:
for
they
had
not
done
it
of
a
long
time
in
such
sort
as
it
was
written.
030:006
So
the
posts
went
with
the
letters
from
the
king
and
his
princes
throughout
all
Israel
and
Judah,
and
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
king,
saying,
Ye
children
of
Israel,
turn
again
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Abraham,
Isaac,
and
Israel,
and
he
will
return
to
the
remnant
of
you,
that
are
escaped
out
of
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
Assyria.
030:007
And
be
not
ye
like
your
fathers,
and
like
your
brethren,
which
trespassed
against
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers,
who
therefore
gave
them
up
to
desolation,
as
ye
see.
030:008
Now
be
ye
not
stiffnecked,
as
your
fathers
were,
but
yield
yourselves
unto
the
LORD,
and
enter
into
his
sanctuary,
which
he
hath
sanctified
for
ever:
and
serve
the
LORD
your
God,
that
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
may
turn
away
from
you.
030:009
For
if
ye
turn
again
unto
the
LORD,
your
brethren
and
your
children
shall
find
compassion
before
them
that
lead
them
captive,
so
that
they
shall
come
again
into
this
land:
for
the
LORD
your
God
is
gracious
and
merciful,
and
will
not
turn
away
his
face
from
you,
if
ye
return
unto
him.
030:010
So
the
posts
passed
from
city
to
city
through
the
country
of
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
even
unto
Zebulun:
but
they
laughed
them
to
scorn,
and
mocked
them.
030:011
Nevertheless
divers
of
Asher
and
Manasseh
and
of
Zebulun
humbled
themselves,
and
came
to
Jerusalem.
030:012
Also
in
Judah
the
hand
of
God
was
to
give
them
one
heart
to
do
the
commandment
of
the
king
and
of
the
princes,
by
the
word
of
the
LORD.
030:013
And
there
assembled
at
Jerusalem
much
people
to
keep
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
in
the
second
month,
a
very
great
congregation.
030:014
And
they
arose
and
took
away
the
altars
that
were
in
Jerusalem,
and
all
the
altars
for
incense
took
they
away,
and
cast
them
into
the
brook
Kidron.
030:015
Then
they
killed
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
second
month:
and
the
priests
and
the
Levites
were
ashamed,
and
sanctified
themselves,
and
brought
in
the
burnt
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
LORD.
030:016
And
they
stood
in
their
place
after
their
manner,
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
the
man
of
God:
the
priests
sprinkled
the
blood,
which
they
received
of
the
hand
of
the
Levites.
030:017
For
there
were
many
in
the
congregation
that
were
not
sanctified:
therefore
the
Levites
had
the
charge
of
the
killing
of
the
passovers
for
every
one
that
was
not
clean,
to
sanctify
them
unto
the
LORD.
030:018
For
a
multitude
of
the
people,
even
many
of
Ephraim,
and
Manasseh,
Issachar,
and
Zebulun,
had
not
cleansed
themselves,
yet
did
they
eat
the
passover
otherwise
than
it
was
written.
But
Hezekiah
prayed
for
them,
saying,
The
good
LORD
pardon
every
one
030:019
That
prepareth
his
heart
to
seek
God,
the
LORD
God
of
his
fathers,
though
he
be
not
cleansed
according
to
the
purification
of
the
sanctuary.
030:020
And
the
LORD
hearkened
to
Hezekiah,
and
healed
the
people.
030:021
And
the
children
of
Israel
that
were
present
at
Jerusalem
kept
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
seven
days
with
great
gladness:
and
the
Levites
and
the
priests
praised
the
LORD
day
by
day,
singing
with
loud
instruments
unto
the
LORD.
030:022
And
Hezekiah
spake
comfortably
unto
all
the
Levites
that
taught
the
good
knowledge
of
the
LORD:
and
they
did
eat
throughout
the
feast
seven
days,
offering
peace
offerings,
and
making
confession
to
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers.
030:023
And
the
whole
assembly
took
counsel
to
keep
other
seven
days:
and
they
kept
other
seven
days
with
gladness.
030:024
For
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah
did
give
to
the
congregation
a
thousand
bullocks
and
seven
thousand
sheep;
and
the
princes
gave
to
the
congregation
a
thousand
bullocks
and
ten
thousand
sheep:
and
a
great
number
of
priests
sanctified
themselves.
030:025
And
all
the
congregation
of
Judah,
with
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
and
all
the
congregation
that
came
out
of
Israel,
and
the
strangers
that
came
out
of
the
land
of
Israel,
and
that
dwelt
in
Judah,
rejoiced.
030:026
So
there
was
great
joy
in
Jerusalem:
for
since
the
time
of
Solomon
the
son
of
David
king
of
Israel
there
was
not
the
like
in
Jerusalem.
030:027
Then
the
priests
the
Levites
arose
and
blessed
the
people:
and
their
voice
was
heard,
and
their
prayer
came
up
to
his
holy
dwelling
place,
even
unto
heaven.
031:001
Now
when
all
this
was
finished,
all
Israel
that
were
present
went
out
to
the
cities
of
Judah,
and
brake
the
images
in
pieces,
and
cut
down
the
groves,
and
threw
down
the
high
places
and
the
altars
out
of
all
Judah
and
Benjamin,
in
Ephraim
also
and
Manasseh,
until
they
had
utterly
destroyed
them
all.
Then
all
the
children
of
Israel
returned,
every
man
to
his
possession,
into
their
own
cities.
031:002
And
Hezekiah
appointed
the
courses
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites
after
their
courses,
every
man
according
to
his
service,
the
priests
and
Levites
for
burnt
offerings
and
for
peace
offerings,
to
minister,
and
to
give
thanks,
and
to
praise
in
the
gates
of
the
tents
of
the
LORD.
031:003
He
appointed
also
the
king's
portion
of
his
substance
for
the
burnt
offerings,
to
wit,
for
the
morning
and
evening
burnt
offerings,
and
the
burnt
offerings
for
the
sabbaths,
and
for
the
new
moons,
and
for
the
set
feasts,
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
the
LORD.
031:004
Moreover
he
commanded
the
people
that
dwelt
in
Jerusalem
to
give
the
portion
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
that
they
might
be
encouraged
in
the
law
of
the
LORD.
031:005
And
as
soon
as
the
commandment
came
abroad,
the
children
of
Israel
brought
in
abundance
the
