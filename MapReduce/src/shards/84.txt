firstfruits
of
corn,
wine,
and
oil,
and
honey,
and
of
all
the
increase
of
the
field;
and
the
tithe
of
all
things
brought
they
in
abundantly.
031:006
And
concerning
the
children
of
Israel
and
Judah,
that
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
Judah,
they
also
brought
in
the
tithe
of
oxen
and
sheep,
and
the
tithe
of
holy
things
which
were
consecrated
unto
the
LORD
their
God,
and
laid
them
by
heaps.
031:007
In
the
third
month
they
began
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
heaps,
and
finished
them
in
the
seventh
month.
031:008
And
when
Hezekiah
and
the
princes
came
and
saw
the
heaps,
they
blessed
the
LORD,
and
his
people
Israel.
031:009
Then
Hezekiah
questioned
with
the
priests
and
the
Levites
concerning
the
heaps.
031:010
And
Azariah
the
chief
priest
of
the
house
of
Zadok
answered
him,
and
said,
Since
the
people
began
to
bring
the
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
we
have
had
enough
to
eat,
and
have
left
plenty:
for
the
LORD
hath
blessed
his
people;
and
that
which
is
left
is
this
great
store.
031:011
Then
Hezekiah
commanded
to
prepare
chambers
in
the
house
of
the
LORD;
and
they
prepared
them,
031:012
And
brought
in
the
offerings
and
the
tithes
and
the
dedicated
things
faithfully:
over
which
Cononiah
the
Levite
was
ruler,
and
Shimei
his
brother
was
the
next.
031:013
And
Jehiel,
and
Azaziah,
and
Nahath,
and
Asahel,
and
Jerimoth,
and
Jozabad,
and
Eliel,
and
Ismachiah,
and
Mahath,
and
Benaiah,
were
overseers
under
the
hand
of
Cononiah
and
Shimei
his
brother,
at
the
commandment
of
Hezekiah
the
king,
and
Azariah
the
ruler
of
the
house
of
God.
031:014
And
Kore
the
son
of
Imnah
the
Levite,
the
porter
toward
the
east,
was
over
the
freewill
offerings
of
God,
to
distribute
the
oblations
of
the
LORD,
and
the
most
holy
things.
031:015
And
next
him
were
Eden,
and
Miniamin,
and
Jeshua,
and
Shemaiah,
Amariah,
and
Shecaniah,
in
the
cities
of
the
priests,
in
their
set
office,
to
give
to
their
brethren
by
courses,
as
well
to
the
great
as
to
the
small:
031:016
Beside
their
genealogy
of
males,
from
three
years
old
and
upward,
even
unto
every
one
that
entereth
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
his
daily
portion
for
their
service
in
their
charges
according
to
their
courses;
031:017
Both
to
the
genealogy
of
the
priests
by
the
house
of
their
fathers,
and
the
Levites
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward,
in
their
charges
by
their
courses;
031:018
And
to
the
genealogy
of
all
their
little
ones,
their
wives,
and
their
sons,
and
their
daughters,
through
all
the
congregation:
for
in
their
set
office
they
sanctified
themselves
in
holiness:
031:019
Also
of
the
sons
of
Aaron
the
priests,
which
were
in
the
fields
of
the
suburbs
of
their
cities,
in
every
several
city,
the
men
that
were
expressed
by
name,
to
give
portions
to
all
the
males
among
the
priests,
and
to
all
that
were
reckoned
by
genealogies
among
the
Levites.
031:020
And
thus
did
Hezekiah
throughout
all
Judah,
and
wrought
that
which
was
good
and
right
and
truth
before
the
LORD
his
God.
031:021
And
in
every
work
that
he
began
in
the
service
of
the
house
of
God,
and
in
the
law,
and
in
the
commandments,
to
seek
his
God,
he
did
it
with
all
his
heart,
and
prospered.
032:001
After
these
things,
and
the
establishment
thereof,
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria
came,
and
entered
into
Judah,
and
encamped
against
the
fenced
cities,
and
thought
to
win
them
for
himself.
032:002
And
when
Hezekiah
saw
that
Sennacherib
was
come,
and
that
he
was
purposed
to
fight
against
Jerusalem,
032:003
He
took
counsel
with
his
princes
and
his
mighty
men
to
stop
the
waters
of
the
fountains
which
were
without
the
city:
and
they
did
help
him.
032:004
So
there
was
gathered
much
people
together,
who
stopped
all
the
fountains,
and
the
brook
that
ran
through
the
midst
of
the
land,
saying,
Why
should
the
kings
of
Assyria
come,
and
find
much
water?
032:005
Also
he
strengthened
himself,
and
built
up
all
the
wall
that
was
broken,
and
raised
it
up
to
the
towers,
and
another
wall
without,
and
repaired
Millo
in
the
city
of
David,
and
made
darts
and
shields
in
abundance.
032:006
And
he
set
captains
of
war
over
the
people,
and
gathered
them
together
to
him
in
the
street
of
the
gate
of
the
city,
and
spake
comfortably
to
them,
saying,
032:007
Be
strong
and
courageous,
be
not
afraid
nor
dismayed
for
the
king
of
Assyria,
nor
for
all
the
multitude
that
is
with
him:
for
there
be
more
with
us
than
with
him:
032:008
With
him
is
an
arm
of
flesh;
but
with
us
is
the
LORD
our
God
to
help
us,
and
to
fight
our
battles.
And
the
people
rested
themselves
upon
the
words
of
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah.
032:009
After
this
did
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria
send
his
servants
to
Jerusalem,
(but
he
himself
laid
siege
against
Lachish,
and
all
his
power
with
him,)
unto
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah,
and
unto
all
Judah
that
were
at
Jerusalem,
saying,
032:010
Thus
saith
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria,
Whereon
do
ye
trust,
that
ye
abide
in
the
siege
in
Jerusalem?
032:011
Doth
not
Hezekiah
persuade
you
to
give
over
yourselves
to
die
by
famine
and
by
thirst,
saying,
The
LORD
our
God
shall
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria?
032:012
Hath
not
the
same
Hezekiah
taken
away
his
high
places
and
his
altars,
and
commanded
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
saying,
Ye
shall
worship
before
one
altar,
and
burn
incense
upon
it?
032:013
Know
ye
not
what
I
and
my
fathers
have
done
unto
all
the
people
of
other
lands?
were
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
those
lands
any
ways
able
to
deliver
their
lands
out
of
mine
hand?
032:014
Who
was
there
among
all
the
gods
of
those
nations
that
my
fathers
utterly
destroyed,
that
could
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand,
that
your
God
should
be
able
to
deliver
you
out
of
mine
hand?
032:015
Now
therefore
let
not
Hezekiah
deceive
you,
nor
persuade
you
on
this
manner,
neither
yet
believe
him:
for
no
god
of
any
nation
or
kingdom
was
able
to
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand,
and
out
of
the
hand
of
my
fathers:
how
much
less
shall
your
God
deliver
you
out
of
mine
hand?
032:016
And
his
servants
spake
yet
more
against
the
LORD
God,
and
against
his
servant
Hezekiah.
032:017
He
wrote
also
letters
to
rail
on
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
and
to
speak
against
him,
saying,
As
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
other
lands
have
not
delivered
their
people
out
of
mine
hand,
so
shall
not
the
God
of
Hezekiah
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand.
032:018
Then
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
Jews'
speech
unto
the
people
of
Jerusalem
that
were
on
the
wall,
to
affright
them,
and
to
trouble
them;
that
they
might
take
the
city.
032:019
And
they
spake
against
the
God
of
Jerusalem,
as
against
the
gods
of
the
people
of
the
earth,
which
were
the
work
of
the
hands
of
man.
032:020
And
for
this
cause
Hezekiah
the
king,
and
the
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz,
prayed
and
cried
to
heaven.
032:021
And
the
LORD
sent
an
angel,
which
cut
off
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour,
and
the
leaders
and
captains
in
the
camp
of
the
king
of
Assyria.
So
he
returned
with
shame
of
face
to
his
own
land.
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
house
of
his
god,
they
that
came
forth
of
his
own
bowels
slew
him
there
with
the
sword.
032:022
Thus
the
LORD
saved
Hezekiah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
from
the
hand
of
Sennacherib
the
king
of
Assyria,
and
from
the
hand
of
all
other,
and
guided
them
on
every
side.
032:023
And
many
brought
gifts
unto
the
LORD
to
Jerusalem,
and
presents
to
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah:
so
that
he
was
magnified
in
the
sight
of
all
nations
from
thenceforth.
032:024
In
those
days
Hezekiah
was
sick
to
the
death,
and
prayed
unto
the
LORD:
and
he
spake
unto
him,
and
he
gave
him
a
sign.
032:025
But
Hezekiah
rendered
not
again
according
to
the
benefit
done
unto
him;
for
his
heart
was
lifted
up:
therefore
there
was
wrath
upon
him,
and
upon
Judah
and
Jerusalem.
032:026
Notwithstanding
Hezekiah
humbled
himself
for
the
pride
of
his
heart,
both
he
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
so
that
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
came
not
upon
them
in
the
days
of
Hezekiah.
032:027
And
Hezekiah
had
exceeding
much
riches
and
honour:
and
he
made
himself
treasuries
for
silver,
and
for
gold,
and
for
precious
stones,
and
for
spices,
and
for
shields,
and
for
all
manner
of
pleasant
jewels;
032:028
Storehouses
also
for
the
increase
of
corn,
and
wine,
and
oil;
and
stalls
for
all
manner
of
beasts,
and
cotes
for
flocks.
032:029
Moreover
he
provided
him
cities,
and
possessions
of
flocks
and
herds
in
abundance:
for
God
had
given
him
substance
very
much.
032:030
This
same
Hezekiah
also
stopped
the
upper
watercourse
of
Gihon,
and
brought
it
straight
down
to
the
west
side
of
the
city
of
David.
And
Hezekiah
prospered
in
all
his
works.
032:031
Howbeit
in
the
business
of
the
ambassadors
of
the
princes
of
Babylon,
who
sent
unto
him
to
enquire
of
the
wonder
that
was
done
in
the
land,
God
left
him,
to
try
him,
that
he
might
know
all
that
was
in
his
heart.
032:032
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Hezekiah,
and
his
goodness,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
vision
of
Isaiah
the
prophet,
the
son
of
Amoz,
and
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Judah
and
Israel.
032:033
And
Hezekiah
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
they
buried
him
in
the
chiefest
of
the
sepulchres
of
the
sons
of
David:
and
all
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
did
him
honour
at
his
death.
And
Manasseh
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
033:001
Manasseh
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
fifty
and
five
years
in
Jerusalem:
033:002
But
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
like
unto
the
abominations
of
the
heathen,
whom
the
LORD
had
cast
out
before
the
children
of
Israel.
033:003
For
he
built
again
the
high
places
which
Hezekiah
his
father
had
broken
down,
and
he
reared
up
altars
for
Baalim,
and
made
groves,
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven,
and
served
them.
033:004
Also
he
built
altars
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
whereof
the
LORD
had
said,
In
Jerusalem
shall
my
name
be
for
ever.
033:005
And
he
built
altars
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
033:006
And
he
caused
his
children
to
pass
through
the
fire
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom:
also
he
observed
times,
and
used
enchantments,
and
used
witchcraft,
and
dealt
with
a
familiar
spirit,
and
with
wizards:
he
wrought
much
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
to
provoke
him
to
anger.
033:007
And
he
set
a
carved
image,
the
idol
which
he
had
made,
in
the
house
of
God,
of
which
God
had
said
to
David
and
to
Solomon
his
son,
In
this
house,
and
in
Jerusalem,
which
I
have
chosen
before
all
the
tribes
of
Israel,
will
I
put
my
name
for
ever:
033:008
Neither
will
I
any
more
remove
the
foot
of
Israel
from
out
of
the
land
which
I
have
appointed
for
your
fathers;
so
that
they
will
take
heed
to
do
all
that
I
have
commanded
them,
according
to
the
whole
law
and
the
statutes
and
the
ordinances
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
033:009
So
Manasseh
made
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
to
err,
and
to
do
worse
than
the
heathen,
whom
the
LORD
had
destroyed
before
the
children
of
Israel.
033:010
And
the
LORD
spake
to
Manasseh,
and
to
his
people:
but
they
would
not
hearken.
033:011
Wherefore
the
LORD
brought
upon
them
the
captains
of
the
host
of
the
king
of
Assyria,
which
took
Manasseh
among
the
thorns,
and
bound
him
with
fetters,
and
carried
him
to
Babylon.
033:012
And
when
he
was
in
affliction,
he
besought
the
LORD
his
God,
and
humbled
himself
greatly
before
the
God
of
his
fathers,
033:013
And
prayed
unto
him:
and
he
was
intreated
of
him,
and
heard
his
supplication,
and
brought
him
again
to
Jerusalem
into
his
kingdom.
Then
Manasseh
knew
that
the
LORD
he
was
God.
033:014
Now
after
this
he
built
a
wall
without
the
city
of
David,
on
the
west
side
of
Gihon,
in
the
valley,
even
to
the
entering
in
at
the
fish
gate,
and
compassed
about
Ophel,
and
raised
it
up
a
very
great
height,
and
put
captains
of
war
in
all
the
fenced
cities
of
Judah.
033:015
And
he
took
away
the
strange
gods,
and
the
idol
out
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
all
the
altars
that
he
had
built
in
the
mount
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
in
Jerusalem,
and
cast
them
out
of
the
city.
033:016
And
he
repaired
the
altar
of
the
LORD,
and
sacrificed
thereon
peace
offerings
and
thank
offerings,
and
commanded
Judah
to
serve
the
LORD
God
of
Israel.
033:017
Nevertheless
the
people
did
sacrifice
still
in
the
high
places,
yet
unto
the
LORD
their
God
only.
033:018
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Manasseh,
and
his
prayer
unto
his
God,
and
the
words
of
the
seers
that
spake
to
him
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
behold,
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Israel.
033:019
His
prayer
also,
and
how
God
was
intreated
of
him,
and
all
his
sins,
and
his
trespass,
and
the
places
wherein
he
built
high
places,
and
set
up
groves
and
graven
images,
before
he
was
humbled:
behold,
they
are
written
among
the
sayings
of
the
seers.
033:020
So
Manasseh
slept
with
his
fathers,
and
they
buried
him
in
his
own
house:
and
Amon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead.
033:021
Amon
was
two
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
reigned
two
years
in
Jerusalem.
033:022
But
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
as
did
Manasseh
his
father:
for
Amon
sacrificed
unto
all
the
carved
images
which
Manasseh
his
father
had
made,
and
served
them;
033:023
And
humbled
not
himself
before
the
LORD,
as
Manasseh
his
father
had
humbled
himself;
but
Amon
trespassed
more
and
more.
033:024
And
his
servants
conspired
against
him,
and
slew
him
in
his
own
house.
033:025
But
the
people
of
the
land
slew
all
them
that
had
conspired
against
king
Amon;
and
the
people
of
the
land
made
Josiah
his
son
king
in
his
stead.
034:001
Josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign,
and
he
reigned
in
Jerusalem
one
and
thirty
years.
034:002
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD,
and
walked
in
the
ways
of
David
his
father,
and
declined
neither
to
the
right
hand,
nor
to
the
left.
034:003
For
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
reign,
while
he
was
yet
young,
he
began
to
seek
after
the
God
of
David
his
father:
and
in
the
twelfth
year
he
began
to
purge
Judah
and
Jerusalem
from
the
high
places,
and
the
groves,
and
the
carved
images,
and
the
molten
images.
034:004
And
they
brake
down
the
altars
of
Baalim
in
his
presence;
and
the
images,
that
were
on
high
above
them,
he
cut
down;
and
the
groves,
and
the
carved
images,
and
the
molten
images,
he
brake
in
pieces,
and
made
dust
of
them,
and
strowed
it
upon
the
graves
of
them
that
had
sacrificed
unto
them.
034:005
And
he
burnt
the
bones
of
the
priests
upon
their
altars,
and
cleansed
Judah
and
Jerusalem.
034:006
And
so
did
he
in
the
cities
of
Manasseh,
and
Ephraim,
and
Simeon,
even
unto
Naphtali,
with
their
mattocks
round
about.
034:007
And
when
he
had
broken
down
the
altars
and
the
groves,
and
had
beaten
the
graven
images
into
powder,
and
cut
down
all
the
idols
throughout
all
the
land
of
Israel,
he
returned
to
Jerusalem.
034:008
Now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
reign,
when
he
had
purged
the
land,
and
the
house,
he
sent
Shaphan
the
son
of
Azaliah,
and
Maaseiah
the
governor
of
the
city,
and
Joah
the
son
of
Joahaz
the
recorder,
to
repair
the
house
of
the
LORD
his
God.
034:009
And
when
they
came
to
Hilkiah
the
high
priest,
they
delivered
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
God,
which
the
Levites
that
kept
the
doors
had
gathered
of
the
hand
of
Manasseh
and
Ephraim,
and
of
all
the
remnant
of
Israel,
and
of
all
Judah
and
Benjamin;
and
they
returned
to
Jerusalem.
034:010
And
they
put
it
in
the
hand
of
the
workmen
that
had
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
they
gave
it
to
the
workmen
that
wrought
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
to
repair
and
amend
the
house:
034:011
Even
to
the
artificers
and
builders
gave
they
it,
to
buy
hewn
stone,
and
timber
for
couplings,
and
to
floor
the
houses
which
the
kings
of
Judah
had
destroyed.
034:012
And
the
men
did
the
work
faithfully:
and
the
overseers
of
them
were
Jahath
and
Obadiah,
the
Levites,
of
the
sons
of
Merari;
and
Zechariah
and
Meshullam,
of
the
sons
of
the
Kohathites,
to
set
it
forward;
and
other
of
the
Levites,
all
that
could
skill
of
instruments
of
musick.
034:013
Also
they
were
over
the
bearers
of
burdens,
and
were
overseers
of
all
that
wrought
the
work
in
any
manner
of
service:
and
of
the
Levites
there
were
scribes,
and
officers,
and
porters.
034:014
And
when
they
brought
out
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
Hilkiah
the
priest
found
a
book
of
the
law
of
the
LORD
given
by
Moses.
034:015
And
Hilkiah
answered
and
said
to
Shaphan
the
scribe,
I
have
found
the
book
of
the
law
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
And
Hilkiah
delivered
the
book
to
Shaphan.
034:016
And
Shaphan
carried
the
book
to
the
king,
and
brought
the
king
word
back
again,
saying,
All
that
was
committed
to
thy
servants,
they
do
it.
034:017
And
they
have
gathered
together
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
have
delivered
it
into
the
hand
of
the
overseers,
and
to
the
hand
of
the
workmen.
034:018
Then
Shaphan
the
scribe
told
the
king,
saying,
Hilkiah
the
priest
hath
given
me
a
book.
And
Shaphan
read
it
before
the
king.
034:019
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
king
had
heard
the
words
of
the
law,
that
he
rent
his
clothes.
034:020
And
the
king
commanded
Hilkiah,
and
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan,
and
Abdon
the
son
of
Micah,
and
Shaphan
the
scribe,
and
Asaiah
a
servant
of
the
king's,
saying,
034:021
Go,
enquire
of
the
LORD
for
me,
and
for
them
that
are
left
in
Israel
and
in
Judah,
concerning
the
words
of
the
book
that
is
found:
for
great
is
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
that
is
poured
out
upon
us,
because
our
fathers
have
not
kept
the
word
of
the
LORD,
to
do
after
all
that
is
written
in
this
book.
034:022
And
Hilkiah,
and
they
that
the
king
had
appointed,
went
to
Huldah
the
prophetess,
the
wife
of
Shallum
the
son
of
Tikvath,
the
son
of
Hasrah,
keeper
of
the
wardrobe;
(now
she
dwelt
in
Jerusalem
in
the
college:)
and
they
spake
to
her
to
that
effect.
034:023
And
she
answered
them,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
Tell
ye
the
man
that
sent
you
to
me,
034:024
Thus
saith
the
LORD,
Behold,
I
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place,
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof,
even
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
the
book
which
they
have
read
before
the
king
of
Judah:
034:025
Because
they
have
forsaken
me,
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods,
that
they
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
all
the
works
of
their
hands;
therefore
my
wrath
shall
be
poured
out
upon
this
place,
and
shall
not
be
quenched.
034:026
And
as
for
the
king
of
Judah,
who
sent
you
to
enquire
of
the
LORD,
so
shall
ye
say
unto
him,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
concerning
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard;
034:027
Because
thine
heart
was
tender,
and
thou
didst
humble
thyself
before
God,
when
thou
heardest
his
words
against
this
place,
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof,
and
humbledst
thyself
before
me,
and
didst
rend
thy
clothes,
and
weep
before
me;
I
have
even
heard
thee
also,
saith
the
LORD.
034:028
Behold,
I
will
gather
thee
to
thy
fathers,
and
thou
shalt
be
gathered
to
thy
grave
in
peace,
neither
shall
thine
eyes
see
all
the
evil
that
I
will
bring
upon
this
place,
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
same.
So
they
brought
the
king
word
again.
034:029
Then
the
king
sent
and
gathered
together
all
the
elders
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem.
034:030
And
the
king
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
LORD,
and
all
the
men
of
Judah,
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem,
and
the
priests,
and
the
Levites,
and
all
the
people,
great
and
small:
and
he
read
in
their
ears
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
LORD.
034:031
And
the
king
stood
in
his
place,
and
made
a
covenant
before
the
LORD,
to
walk
after
the
LORD,
and
to
keep
his
commandments,
and
his
testimonies,
and
his
statutes,
with
all
his
heart,
and
with
all
his
soul,
to
perform
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
are
written
in
this
book.
034:032
And
he
caused
all
that
were
present
in
Jerusalem
and
Benjamin
to
stand
to
it.
And
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
did
according
to
the
covenant
of
God,
the
God
of
their
fathers.
034:033
And
Josiah
took
away
all
the
abominations
out
of
all
the
countries
that
pertained
to
the
children
of
Israel,
and
made
all
that
were
present
in
Israel
to
serve,
even
to
serve
the
LORD
their
God.
And
all
his
days
they
departed
not
from
following
the
LORD,
the
God
of
their
fathers.
035:001
Moreover
Josiah
kept
a
passover
unto
the
LORD
in
Jerusalem:
and
they
killed
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
first
month.
035:002
And
he
set
the
priests
in
their
charges,
and
encouraged
them
to
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD,
035:003
And
said
unto
the
Levites
that
taught
all
Israel,
which
were
holy
unto
the
LORD,
Put
the
holy
ark
in
the
house
which
Solomon
the
son
of
David
king
of
Israel
did
build;
it
shall
not
be
a
burden
upon
your
shoulders:
serve
now
the
LORD
your
God,
and
his
people
Israel,
035:004
And
prepare
yourselves
by
the
houses
of
your
fathers,
after
your
courses,
according
to
the
writing
of
David
king
of
Israel,
and
according
to
the
writing
of
Solomon
his
son.
035:005
And
stand
in
the
holy
place
according
to
the
divisions
of
the
families
of
the
fathers
of
your
brethren
the
people,
and
after
the
division
of
the
families
of
the
Levites.
035:006
So
kill
the
passover,
and
sanctify
yourselves,
and
prepare
your
brethren,
that
they
may
do
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
the
hand
of
Moses.
035:007
And
Josiah
gave
to
the
people,
of
the
flock,
lambs
and
kids,
all
for
the
passover
offerings,
for
all
that
were
present,
to
the
number
of
thirty
thousand,
and
three
thousand
bullocks:
these
were
of
the
king's
substance.
035:008
And
his
princes
gave
willingly
unto
the
people,
to
the
priests,
and
to
the
Levites:
Hilkiah
and
Zechariah
and
Jehiel,
rulers
of
the
house
of
God,
gave
unto
the
priests
for
the
passover
offerings
two
thousand
and
six
hundred
small
cattle
and
three
hundred
oxen.
035:009
Conaniah
also,
and
Shemaiah
and
Nethaneel,
his
brethren,
and
Hashabiah
and
Jeiel
and
Jozabad,
chief
of
the
Levites,
gave
unto
the
Levites
for
passover
offerings
five
thousand
small
cattle,
and
five
hundred
oxen.
035:010
So
the
service
was
prepared,
and
the
priests
stood
in
their
place,
and
the
Levites
in
their
courses,
according
to
the
king's
commandment.
035:011
And
they
killed
the
passover,
and
the
priests
sprinkled
the
blood
from
their
hands,
and
the
Levites
flayed
them.
035:012
And
they
removed
the
burnt
offerings,
that
they
