Jews,
and
made
them
to
cease
by
force
and
power.
004:024
Then
ceased
the
work
of
the
house
of
God
which
is
at
Jerusalem.
So
it
ceased
unto
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
Darius
king
of
Persia.
005:001
Then
the
prophets,
Haggai
the
prophet,
and
Zechariah
the
son
of
Iddo,
prophesied
unto
the
Jews
that
were
in
Judah
and
Jerusalem
in
the
name
of
the
God
of
Israel,
even
unto
them.
005:002
Then
rose
up
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel,
and
Jeshua
the
son
of
Jozadak,
and
began
to
build
the
house
of
God
which
is
at
Jerusalem:
and
with
them
were
the
prophets
of
God
helping
them.
005:003
At
the
same
time
came
to
them
Tatnai,
governor
on
this
side
the
river,
and
Shetharboznai
and
their
companions,
and
said
thus
unto
them,
Who
hath
commanded
you
to
build
this
house,
and
to
make
up
this
wall?
005:004
Then
said
we
unto
them
after
this
manner,
What
are
the
names
of
the
men
that
make
this
building?
005:005
But
the
eye
of
their
God
was
upon
the
elders
of
the
Jews,
that
they
could
not
cause
them
to
cease,
till
the
matter
came
to
Darius:
and
then
they
returned
answer
by
letter
concerning
this
matter.
005:006
The
copy
of
the
letter
that
Tatnai,
governor
on
this
side
the
river,
and
Shetharboznai
and
his
companions
the
Apharsachites,
which
were
on
this
side
the
river,
sent
unto
Darius
the
king:
005:007
They
sent
a
letter
unto
him,
wherein
was
written
thus;
Unto
Darius
the
king,
all
peace.
005:008
Be
it
known
unto
the
king,
that
we
went
into
the
province
of
Judea,
to
the
house
of
the
great
God,
which
is
builded
with
great
stones,
and
timber
is
laid
in
the
walls,
and
this
work
goeth
fast
on,
and
prospereth
in
their
hands.
005:009
Then
asked
we
those
elders,
and
said
unto
them
thus,
Who
commanded
you
to
build
this
house,
and
to
make
up
these
walls?
005:010
We
asked
their
names
also,
to
certify
thee,
that
we
might
write
the
names
of
the
men
that
were
the
chief
of
them.
005:011
And
thus
they
returned
us
answer,
saying,
We
are
the
servants
of
the
God
of
heaven
and
earth,
and
build
the
house
that
was
builded
these
many
years
ago,
which
a
great
king
of
Israel
builded
and
set
up.
005:012
But
after
that
our
fathers
had
provoked
the
God
of
heaven
unto
wrath,
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
Babylon,
the
Chaldean,
who
destroyed
this
house,
and
carried
the
people
away
into
Babylon.
005:013
But
in
the
first
year
of
Cyrus
the
king
of
Babylon
the
same
king
Cyrus
made
a
decree
to
build
this
house
of
God.
005:014
And
the
vessels
also
of
gold
and
silver
of
the
house
of
God,
which
Nebuchadnezzar
took
out
of
the
temple
that
was
in
Jerusalem,
and
brought
them
into
the
temple
of
Babylon,
those
did
Cyrus
the
king
take
out
of
the
temple
of
Babylon,
and
they
were
delivered
unto
one,
whose
name
was
Sheshbazzar,
whom
he
had
made
governor;
005:015
And
said
unto
him,
Take
these
vessels,
go,
carry
them
into
the
temple
that
is
in
Jerusalem,
and
let
the
house
of
God
be
builded
in
his
place.
005:016
Then
came
the
same
Sheshbazzar,
and
laid
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
God
which
is
in
Jerusalem:
and
since
that
time
even
until
now
hath
it
been
in
building,
and
yet
it
is
not
finished.
005:017
Now
therefore,
if
it
seem
good
to
the
king,
let
there
be
search
made
in
the
king's
treasure
house,
which
is
there
at
Babylon,
whether
it
be
so,
that
a
decree
was
made
of
Cyrus
the
king
to
build
this
house
of
God
at
Jerusalem,
and
let
the
king
send
his
pleasure
to
us
concerning
this
matter.
006:001
Then
Darius
the
king
made
a
decree,
and
search
was
made
in
the
house
of
the
rolls,
where
the
treasures
were
laid
up
in
Babylon.
006:002
And
there
was
found
at
Achmetha,
in
the
palace
that
is
in
the
province
of
the
Medes,
a
roll,
and
therein
was
a
record
thus
written:
006:003
In
the
first
year
of
Cyrus
the
king
the
same
Cyrus
the
king
made
a
decree
concerning
the
house
of
God
at
Jerusalem,
Let
the
house
be
builded,
the
place
where
they
offered
sacrifices,
and
let
the
foundations
thereof
be
strongly
laid;
the
height
thereof
threescore
cubits,
and
the
breadth
thereof
threescore
cubits;
006:004
With
three
rows
of
great
stones,
and
a
row
of
new
timber:
and
let
the
expenses
be
given
out
of
the
king's
house:
006:005
And
also
let
the
golden
and
silver
vessels
of
the
house
of
God,
which
Nebuchadnezzar
took
forth
out
of
the
temple
which
is
at
Jerusalem,
and
brought
unto
Babylon,
be
restored,
and
brought
again
unto
the
temple
which
is
at
Jerusalem,
every
one
to
his
place,
and
place
them
in
the
house
of
God.
006:006
Now
therefore,
Tatnai,
governor
beyond
the
river,
Shetharboznai,
and
your
companions
the
Apharsachites,
which
are
beyond
the
river,
be
ye
far
from
thence:
006:007
Let
the
work
of
this
house
of
God
alone;
let
the
governor
of
the
Jews
and
the
elders
of
the
Jews
build
this
house
of
God
in
his
place.
006:008
Moreover
I
make
a
decree
what
ye
shall
do
to
the
elders
of
these
Jews
for
the
building
of
this
house
of
God:
that
of
the
king's
goods,
even
of
the
tribute
beyond
the
river,
forthwith
expenses
be
given
unto
these
men,
that
they
be
not
hindered.
006:009
And
that
which
they
have
need
of,
both
young
bullocks,
and
rams,
and
lambs,
for
the
burnt
offerings
of
the
God
of
heaven,
wheat,
salt,
wine,
and
oil,
according
to
the
appointment
of
the
priests
which
are
at
Jerusalem,
let
it
be
given
them
day
by
day
without
fail:
006:010
That
they
may
offer
sacrifices
of
sweet
savours
unto
the
God
of
heaven,
and
pray
for
the
life
of
the
king,
and
of
his
sons.
006:011
Also
I
have
made
a
decree,
that
whosoever
shall
alter
this
word,
let
timber
be
pulled
down
from
his
house,
and
being
set
up,
let
him
be
hanged
thereon;
and
let
his
house
be
made
a
dunghill
for
this.
006:012
And
the
God
that
hath
caused
his
name
to
dwell
there
destroy
all
kings
and
people,
that
shall
put
to
their
hand
to
alter
and
to
destroy
this
house
of
God
which
is
at
Jerusalem.
I
Darius
have
made
a
decree;
let
it
be
done
with
speed.
006:013
Then
Tatnai,
governor
on
this
side
the
river,
Shetharboznai,
and
their
companions,
according
to
that
which
Darius
the
king
had
sent,
so
they
did
speedily.
006:014
And
the
elders
of
the
Jews
builded,
and
they
prospered
through
the
prophesying
of
Haggai
the
prophet
and
Zechariah
the
son
of
Iddo.
And
they
builded,
and
finished
it,
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
God
of
Israel,
and
according
to
the
commandment
of
Cyrus,
and
Darius,
and
Artaxerxes
king
of
Persia.
006:015
And
this
house
was
finished
on
the
third
day
of
the
month
Adar,
which
was
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
Darius
the
king.
006:016
And
the
children
of
Israel,
the
priests,
and
the
Levites,
and
the
rest
of
the
children
of
the
captivity,
kept
the
dedication
of
this
house
of
God
with
joy.
006:017
And
offered
at
the
dedication
of
this
house
of
God
an
hundred
bullocks,
two
hundred
rams,
four
hundred
lambs;
and
for
a
sin
offering
for
all
Israel,
twelve
he
goats,
according
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
Israel.
006:018
And
they
set
the
priests
in
their
divisions,
and
the
Levites
in
their
courses,
for
the
service
of
God,
which
is
at
Jerusalem;
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
Moses.
006:019
And
the
children
of
the
captivity
kept
the
passover
upon
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
first
month.
006:020
For
the
priests
and
the
Levites
were
purified
together,
all
of
them
were
pure,
and
killed
the
passover
for
all
the
children
of
the
captivity,
and
for
their
brethren
the
priests,
and
for
themselves.
006:021
And
the
children
of
Israel,
which
were
come
again
out
of
captivity,
and
all
such
as
had
separated
themselves
unto
them
from
the
filthiness
of
the
heathen
of
the
land,
to
seek
the
LORD
God
of
Israel,
did
eat,
006:022
And
kept
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
seven
days
with
joy:
for
the
LORD
had
made
them
joyful,
and
turned
the
heart
of
the
king
of
Assyria
unto
them,
to
strengthen
their
hands
in
the
work
of
the
house
of
God,
the
God
of
Israel.
007:001
Now
after
these
things,
in
the
reign
of
Artaxerxes
king
of
Persia,
Ezra
the
son
of
Seraiah,
the
son
of
Azariah,
the
son
of
Hilkiah,
007:002
The
son
of
Shallum,
the
son
of
Zadok,
the
son
of
Ahitub,
007:003
The
son
of
Amariah,
the
son
of
Azariah,
the
son
of
Meraioth,
007:004
The
son
of
Zerahiah,
the
son
of
Uzzi,
the
son
of
Bukki,
007:005
The
son
of
Abishua,
the
son
of
Phinehas,
the
son
of
Eleazar,
the
son
of
Aaron
the
chief
priest:
007:006
This
Ezra
went
up
from
Babylon;
and
he
was
a
ready
scribe
in
the
law
of
Moses,
which
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
had
given:
and
the
king
granted
him
all
his
request,
according
to
the
hand
of
the
LORD
his
God
upon
him.
007:007
And
there
went
up
some
of
the
children
of
Israel,
and
of
the
priests,
and
the
Levites,
and
the
singers,
and
the
porters,
and
the
Nethinims,
unto
Jerusalem,
in
the
seventh
year
of
Artaxerxes
the
king.
007:008
And
he
came
to
Jerusalem
in
the
fifth
month,
which
was
in
the
seventh
year
of
the
king.
007:009
For
upon
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
began
he
to
go
up
from
Babylon,
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
fifth
month
came
he
to
Jerusalem,
according
to
the
good
hand
of
his
God
upon
him.
007:010
For
Ezra
had
prepared
his
heart
to
seek
the
law
of
the
LORD,
and
to
do
it,
and
to
teach
in
Israel
statutes
and
judgments.
007:011
Now
this
is
the
copy
of
the
letter
that
the
king
Artaxerxes
gave
unto
Ezra
the
priest,
the
scribe,
even
a
scribe
of
the
words
of
the
commandments
of
the
LORD,
and
of
his
statutes
to
Israel.
007:012
Artaxerxes,
king
of
kings,
unto
Ezra
the
priest,
a
scribe
of
the
law
of
the
God
of
heaven,
perfect
peace,
and
at
such
a
time.
007:013
I
make
a
decree,
that
all
they
of
the
people
of
Israel,
and
of
his
priests
and
Levites,
in
my
realm,
which
are
minded
of
their
own
freewill
to
go
up
to
Jerusalem,
go
with
thee.
007:014
Forasmuch
as
thou
art
sent
of
the
king,
and
of
his
seven
counsellors,
to
enquire
concerning
Judah
and
Jerusalem,
according
to
the
law
of
thy
God
which
is
in
thine
hand;
007:015
And
to
carry
the
silver
and
gold,
which
the
king
and
his
counsellors
have
freely
offered
unto
the
God
of
Israel,
whose
habitation
is
in
Jerusalem,
007:016
And
all
the
silver
and
gold
that
thou
canst
find
in
all
the
province
of
Babylon,
with
the
freewill
offering
of
the
people,
and
of
the
priests,
offering
willingly
for
the
house
of
their
God
which
is
in
Jerusalem:
007:017
That
thou
mayest
buy
speedily
with
this
money
bullocks,
rams,
lambs,
with
their
meat
offerings
and
their
drink
offerings,
and
offer
them
upon
the
altar
of
the
house
of
your
God
which
is
in
Jerusalem.
007:018
And
whatsoever
shall
seem
good
to
thee,
and
to
thy
brethren,
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
silver
and
the
gold,
that
do
after
the
will
of
your
God.
007:019
The
vessels
also
that
are
given
thee
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
thy
God,
those
deliver
thou
before
the
God
of
Jerusalem.
007:020
And
whatsoever
more
shall
be
needful
for
the
house
of
thy
God,
which
thou
shalt
have
occasion
to
bestow,
bestow
it
out
of
the
king's
treasure
house.
007:021
And
I,
even
I
Artaxerxes
the
king,
do
make
a
decree
to
all
the
treasurers
which
are
beyond
the
river,
that
whatsoever
Ezra
the
priest,
the
scribe
of
the
law
of
the
God
of
heaven,
shall
require
of
you,
it
be
done
speedily,
007:022
Unto
an
hundred
talents
of
silver,
and
to
an
hundred
measures
of
wheat,
and
to
an
hundred
baths
of
wine,
and
to
an
hundred
baths
of
oil,
and
salt
without
prescribing
how
much.
007:023
Whatsoever
is
commanded
by
the
God
of
heaven,
let
it
be
diligently
done
for
the
house
of
the
God
of
heaven:
for
why
should
there
be
wrath
against
the
realm
of
the
king
and
his
sons?
007:024
Also
we
certify
you,
that
touching
any
of
the
priests
and
Levites,
singers,
porters,
Nethinims,
or
ministers
of
this
house
of
God,
it
shall
not
be
lawful
to
impose
toll,
tribute,
or
custom,
upon
them.
007:025
And
thou,
Ezra,
after
the
wisdom
of
thy
God,
that
is
in
thine
hand,
set
magistrates
and
judges,
which
may
judge
all
the
people
that
are
beyond
the
river,
all
such
as
know
the
laws
of
thy
God;
and
teach
ye
them
that
know
them
not.
007:026
And
whosoever
will
not
do
the
law
of
thy
God,
and
the
law
of
the
king,
let
judgment
be
executed
speedily
upon
him,
whether
it
be
unto
death,
or
to
banishment,
or
to
confiscation
of
goods,
or
to
imprisonment.
007:027
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
our
fathers,
which
hath
put
such
a
thing
as
this
in
the
king's
heart,
to
beautify
the
house
of
the
LORD
which
is
in
Jerusalem:
007:028
And
hath
extended
mercy
unto
me
before
the
king,
and
his
counsellors,
and
before
all
the
king's
mighty
princes.
And
I
was
strengthened
as
the
hand
of
the
LORD
my
God
was
upon
me,
and
I
gathered
together
out
of
Israel
chief
men
to
go
up
with
me.
008:001
These
are
now
the
chief
of
their
fathers,
and
this
is
the
genealogy
of
them
that
went
up
with
me
from
Babylon,
in
the
reign
of
Artaxerxes
the
king.
008:002
Of
the
sons
of
Phinehas;
Gershom:
of
the
sons
of
Ithamar;
Daniel:
of
the
sons
of
David;
Hattush.
008:003
Of
the
sons
of
Shechaniah,
of
the
sons
of
Pharosh;
Zechariah:
and
with
him
were
reckoned
by
genealogy
of
the
males
an
hundred
and
fifty.
008:004
Of
the
sons
of
Pahathmoab;
Elihoenai
the
son
of
Zerahiah,
and
with
him
two
hundred
males.
008:005
Of
the
sons
of
Shechaniah;
the
son
of
Jahaziel,
and
with
him
three
hundred
males.
008:006
Of
the
sons
also
of
Adin;
Ebed
the
son
of
Jonathan,
and
with
him
fifty
males.
008:007
And
of
the
sons
of
Elam;
Jeshaiah
the
son
of
Athaliah,
and
with
him
seventy
males.
008:008
And
of
the
sons
of
Shephatiah;
Zebadiah
the
son
of
Michael,
and
with
him
fourscore
males.
008:009
Of
the
sons
of
Joab;
Obadiah
the
son
of
Jehiel,
and
with
him
two
hundred
and
eighteen
males.
008:010
And
of
the
sons
of
Shelomith;
the
son
of
Josiphiah,
and
with
him
an
hundred
and
threescore
males.
008:011
And
of
the
sons
of
Bebai;
Zechariah
the
son
of
Bebai,
and
with
him
twenty
and
eight
males.
008:012
And
of
the
sons
of
Azgad;
Johanan
the
son
of
Hakkatan,
and
with
him
an
hundred
and
ten
males.
008:013
And
of
the
last
sons
of
Adonikam,
whose
names
are
these,
Eliphelet,
Jeiel,
and
Shemaiah,
and
with
them
threescore
males.
008:014
Of
the
sons
also
of
Bigvai;
Uthai,
and
Zabbud,
and
with
them
seventy
males.
008:015
And
I
gathered
them
together
to
the
river
that
runneth
to
Ahava;
and
there
abode
we
in
tents
three
days:
and
I
viewed
the
people,
and
the
priests,
and
found
there
none
of
the
sons
of
Levi.
008:016
Then
sent
I
for
Eliezer,
for
Ariel,
for
Shemaiah,
and
for
Elnathan,
and
for
Jarib,
and
for
Elnathan,
and
for
Nathan,
and
for
Zechariah,
and
for
Meshullam,
chief
men;
also
for
Joiarib,
and
for
Elnathan,
men
of
understanding.
008:017
And
I
sent
them
with
commandment
unto
Iddo
the
chief
at
the
place
Casiphia,
and
I
told
them
what
they
should
say
unto
Iddo,
and
to
his
brethren
the
Nethinims,
at
the
place
Casiphia,
that
they
should
bring
unto
us
ministers
for
the
house
of
our
God.
008:018
And
by
the
good
hand
of
our
God
upon
us
they
brought
us
a
man
of
understanding,
of
the
sons
of
Mahli,
the
son
of
Levi,
the
son
of
Israel;
and
Sherebiah,
with
his
sons
and
his
brethren,
eighteen;
008:019
And
Hashabiah,
and
with
him
Jeshaiah
of
the
sons
of
Merari,
his
brethren
and
their
sons,
twenty;
008:020
Also
of
the
Nethinims,
whom
David
and
the
princes
had
appointed
for
the
service
of
the
Levites,
two
hundred
and
twenty
Nethinims:
all
of
them
were
expressed
by
name.
008:021
Then
I
proclaimed
a
fast
there,
at
the
river
of
Ahava,
that
we
might
afflict
ourselves
before
our
God,
to
seek
of
him
a
right
way
for
us,
and
for
our
little
ones,
and
for
all
our
substance.
008:022
For
I
was
ashamed
to
require
of
the
king
a
band
of
soldiers
and
horsemen
to
help
us
against
the
enemy
in
the
way:
because
we
had
spoken
unto
the
king,
saying,
The
hand
of
our
God
is
upon
all
them
for
good
that
seek
him;
but
his
power
and
his
wrath
is
against
all
them
that
forsake
him.
008:023
So
we
fasted
and
besought
our
God
for
this:
and
he
was
intreated
of
us.
008:024
Then
I
separated
twelve
of
the
chief
of
the
priests,
Sherebiah,
Hashabiah,
and
ten
of
their
brethren
with
them,
008:025
And
weighed
unto
them
the
silver,
and
the
gold,
and
the
vessels,
even
the
offering
of
the
house
of
our
God,
which
the
king,
and
his
counsellors,
and
his
lords,
and
all
Israel
there
present,
had
offered:
008:026
I
even
weighed
unto
their
hand
six
hundred
and
fifty
talents
of
silver,
and
silver
vessels
an
hundred
talents,
and
of
gold
an
hundred
talents;
008:027
Also
twenty
basons
of
gold,
of
a
thousand
drams;
and
two
vessels
of
fine
copper,
precious
as
gold.
008:028
And
I
said
unto
them,
Ye
are
holy
unto
the
LORD;
the
vessels
are
holy
also;
and
the
silver
and
the
gold
are
a
freewill
offering
unto
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers.
008:029
Watch
ye,
and
keep
them,
until
ye
weigh
them
before
the
chief
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
and
chief
of
the
fathers
of
Israel,
at
Jerusalem,
in
the
chambers
of
the
house
of
the
LORD.
008:030
So
took
the
priests
and
the
Levites
the
weight
of
the
silver,
and
the
gold,
and
the
vessels,
to
bring
them
to
Jerusalem
unto
the
house
of
our
God.
008:031
Then
we
departed
from
the
river
of
Ahava
on
the
twelfth
day
of
the
first
month,
to
go
unto
Jerusalem:
and
the
hand
of
our
God
was
upon
us,
and
he
delivered
us
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy,
and
of
such
as
lay
in
wait
by
the
way.
008:032
And
we
came
to
Jerusalem,
and
abode
there
three
days.
008:033
Now
on
the
fourth
day
was
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
weighed
in
the
house
of
our
God
by
the
hand
of
Meremoth
the
son
of
Uriah
the
priest;
and
with
him
was
Eleazar
the
son
of
Phinehas;
and
with
them
was
Jozabad
the
son
of
Jeshua,
and
Noadiah
the
son
of
Binnui,
Levites;
008:034
By
number
and
by
weight
of
every
one:
and
all
the
weight
was
written
at
that
time.
008:035
Also
the
children
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away,
which
were
come
out
of
the
captivity,
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
God
of
Israel,
twelve
bullocks
for
all
Israel,
ninety
and
six
rams,
seventy
and
seven
lambs,
twelve
he
goats
for
a
sin
offering:
all
this
was
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
LORD.
008:036
And
they
delivered
the
king's
commissions
unto
the
king's
lieutenants,
and
to
the
governors
on
this
side
the
river:
and
they
furthered
the
people,
and
the
house
of
God.
009:001
Now
when
these
things
were
done,
the
princes
came
to
me,
saying,
The
people
of
Israel,
and
the
priests,
and
the
Levites,
have
not
separated
themselves
from
the
people
of
the
lands,
doing
according
to
their
abominations,
even
of
the
Canaanites,
the
Hittites,
the
Perizzites,
the
Jebusites,
the
Ammonites,
the
Moabites,
the
Egyptians,
and
the
Amorites.
009:002
For
they
have
taken
of
their
daughters
for
themselves,
and
for
their
sons:
so
that
the
holy
seed
have
mingled
themselves
with
the
people
of
those
lands:
yea,
the
hand
of
the
princes
and
rulers
hath
been
chief
in
this
trespass.
009:003
And
when
I
heard
this
thing,
I
rent
my
garment
and
my
mantle,
and
plucked
off
the
hair
of
my
head
and
of
my
beard,
and
sat
down
astonied.
009:004
Then
were
assembled
unto
me
every
one
that
trembled
at
the
words
of
the
God
of
Israel,
because
of
the
transgression
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away;
and
I
sat
astonied
until
the
evening
sacrifice.
009:005
And
at
the
evening
sacrifice
I
arose
up
from
my
heaviness;
and
having
rent
my
garment
and
my
mantle,
I
fell
upon
my
knees,
and
spread
out
my
hands
unto
the
LORD
my
God,
009:006
And
said,
O
my
God,
I
am
ashamed
and
blush
to
lift
up
my
face
to
thee,
my
God:
for
our
iniquities
are
increased
over
our
head,
and
our
trespass
is
grown
up
unto
the
heavens.
009:007
Since
the
days
of
our
fathers
have
we
been
in
a
great
trespass
unto
this
day;
and
for
our
iniquities
have
we,
our
kings,
and
our
priests,
been
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
the
lands,
to
the
sword,
to
captivity,
and
to
a
spoil,
and
to
confusion
of
face,
as
it
is
this
day.
009:008
And
now
for
a
little
space
grace
hath
been
shewed
from
the
LORD
our
God,
to
leave
us
a
remnant
to
escape,
and
to
give
us
a
nail
in
his
holy
place,
that
our
God
may
lighten
our
eyes,
and
give
us
a
little
reviving
in
our
bondage.
009:009
For
we
were
bondmen;
yet
our
God
hath
not
forsaken
us
in
our
bondage,
but
hath
extended
mercy
unto
us
in
the
sight
of
the
kings
of
Persia,
to
give
us
a
reviving,
to
set
up
the
house
of
our
God,
and
to
repair
the
desolations
thereof,
and
to
give
us
a
wall
in
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem.
009:010
And
now,
O
our
God,
what
shall
we
say
after
this?
for
we
have
forsaken
thy
commandments,
009:011
Which
thou
hast
commanded
by
thy
servants
the
prophets,
saying,
The
land,
unto
which
ye
go
to
possess
it,
is
an
unclean
land
with
the
filthiness
of
the
people
of
the
lands,
with
their
abominations,
which
have
filled
it
from
one
end
to
another
with
their
uncleanness.
009:012
Now
therefore
give
not
your
daughters
unto
their
sons,
neither
take
their
daughters
unto
your
sons,
nor
seek
their
peace
or
their
wealth
for
ever:
that
ye
may
be
strong,
and
eat
the
good
of
the
land,
and
leave
it
for
an
inheritance
to
your
children
for
ever.
009:013
And
after
all
that
is
come
upon
us
for
our
evil
deeds,
and
for
our
great
trespass,
seeing
that
thou
our
God
hast
punished
us
less
than
our
iniquities
deserve,
and
hast
given
us
such
deliverance
as
this;
009:014
Should
we
again
break
thy
commandments,
and
join
in
affinity
with
the
people
of
these
abominations?
wouldest
not
thou
be
angry
with
us
till
thou
hadst
consumed
us,
so
that
there
should
be
no
remnant
nor
escaping?
009:015
O
LORD
God
of
Israel,
thou
art
righteous:
for
we
remain
yet
escaped,
as
it
is
this
day:
behold,
we
are
before
thee
in
our
trespasses:
for
we
cannot
stand
before
thee
because
of
this.
010:001
Now
when
Ezra
had
prayed,
and
when
he
had
confessed,
weeping
and
casting
himself
down
before
the
house
of
God,
there
assembled
unto
him
out
of
Israel
a
very
great
congregation
of
men
and
women
and
children:
for
the
people
wept
very
sore.
010:002
And
Shechaniah
the
son
of
Jehiel,
one
of
the
sons
of
Elam,
answered
and
said
unto
Ezra,
We
have
trespassed
against
our
God,
and
have
taken
strange
wives
of
the
people
of
the
land:
yet
now
there
is
hope
in
Israel
concerning
this
thing.
010:003
Now
therefore
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
our
God
to
put
away
all
the
wives,
and
such
