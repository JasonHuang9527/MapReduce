as
are
born
of
them,
according
to
the
counsel
of
my
lord,
and
of
those
that
tremble
at
the
commandment
of
our
God;
and
let
it
be
done
according
to
the
law.
010:004
Arise;
for
this
matter
belongeth
unto
thee:
we
also
will
be
with
thee:
be
of
good
courage,
and
do
it.
010:005
Then
arose
Ezra,
and
made
the
chief
priests,
the
Levites,
and
all
Israel,
to
swear
that
they
should
do
according
to
this
word.
And
they
sware.
010:006
Then
Ezra
rose
up
from
before
the
house
of
God,
and
went
into
the
chamber
of
Johanan
the
son
of
Eliashib:
and
when
he
came
thither,
he
did
eat
no
bread,
nor
drink
water:
for
he
mourned
because
of
the
transgression
of
them
that
had
been
carried
away.
010:007
And
they
made
proclamation
throughout
Judah
and
Jerusalem
unto
all
the
children
of
the
captivity,
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
unto
Jerusalem;
010:008
And
that
whosoever
would
not
come
within
three
days,
according
to
the
counsel
of
the
princes
and
the
elders,
all
his
substance
should
be
forfeited,
and
himself
separated
from
the
congregation
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away.
010:009
Then
all
the
men
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
unto
Jerusalem
within
three
days.
It
was
the
ninth
month,
on
the
twentieth
day
of
the
month;
and
all
the
people
sat
in
the
street
of
the
house
of
God,
trembling
because
of
this
matter,
and
for
the
great
rain.
010:010
And
Ezra
the
priest
stood
up,
and
said
unto
them,
Ye
have
transgressed,
and
have
taken
strange
wives,
to
increase
the
trespass
of
Israel.
010:011
Now
therefore
make
confession
unto
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers,
and
do
his
pleasure:
and
separate
yourselves
from
the
people
of
the
land,
and
from
the
strange
wives.
010:012
Then
all
the
congregation
answered
and
said
with
a
loud
voice,
As
thou
hast
said,
so
must
we
do.
010:013
But
the
people
are
many,
and
it
is
a
time
of
much
rain,
and
we
are
not
able
to
stand
without,
neither
is
this
a
work
of
one
day
or
two:
for
we
are
many
that
have
transgressed
in
this
thing.
010:014
Let
now
our
rulers
of
all
the
congregation
stand,
and
let
all
them
which
have
taken
strange
wives
in
our
cities
come
at
appointed
times,
and
with
them
the
elders
of
every
city,
and
the
judges
thereof,
until
the
fierce
wrath
of
our
God
for
this
matter
be
turned
from
us.
010:015
Only
Jonathan
the
son
of
Asahel
and
Jahaziah
the
son
of
Tikvah
were
employed
about
this
matter:
and
Meshullam
and
Shabbethai
the
Levite
helped
them.
010:016
And
the
children
of
the
captivity
did
so.
And
Ezra
the
priest,
with
certain
chief
of
the
fathers,
after
the
house
of
their
fathers,
and
all
of
them
by
their
names,
were
separated,
and
sat
down
in
the
first
day
of
the
tenth
month
to
examine
the
matter.
010:017
And
they
made
an
end
with
all
the
men
that
had
taken
strange
wives
by
the
first
day
of
the
first
month.
010:018
And
among
the
sons
of
the
priests
there
were
found
that
had
taken
strange
wives:
namely,
of
the
sons
of
Jeshua
the
son
of
Jozadak,
and
his
brethren;
Maaseiah,
and
Eliezer,
and
Jarib,
and
Gedaliah.
010:019
And
they
gave
their
hands
that
they
would
put
away
their
wives;
and
being
guilty,
they
offered
a
ram
of
the
flock
for
their
trespass.
010:020

children.
Book
16	Nehemiah
001:001
The
words
of
Nehemiah
the
son
of
Hachaliah.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
month
Chisleu,
in
the
twentieth
year,
as
I
was
in
Shushan
the
palace,
001:002
That
Hanani,
one
of
my
brethren,
came,
he
and
certain
men
of
Judah;
and
I
asked
them
concerning
the
Jews
that
had
escaped,
which
were
left
of
the
captivity,
and
concerning
Jerusalem.
001:003
And
they
said
unto
me,
The
remnant
that
are
left
of
the
captivity
there
in
the
province
are
in
great
affliction
and
reproach:
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
also
is
broken
down,
and
the
gates
thereof
are
burned
with
fire.
001:004
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
I
heard
these
words,
that
I
sat
down
and
wept,
and
mourned
certain
days,
and
fasted,
and
prayed
before
the
God
of
heaven,
001:005
And
said,
I
beseech
thee,
O
LORD
God
of
heaven,
the
great
and
terrible
God,
that
keepeth
covenant
and
mercy
for
them
that
love
him
and
observe
his
commandments:
001:006
Let
thine
ear
now
be
attentive,
and
thine
eyes
open,
that
thou
mayest
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
servant,
which
I
pray
before
thee
now,
day
and
night,
for
the
children
of
Israel
thy
servants,
and
confess
the
sins
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
we
have
sinned
against
thee:
both
I
and
my
father's
house
have
sinned.
001:007
We
have
dealt
very
corruptly
against
thee,
and
have
not
kept
the
commandments,
nor
the
statutes,
nor
the
judgments,
which
thou
commandedst
thy
servant
Moses.
001:008
Remember,
I
beseech
thee,
the
word
that
thou
commandedst
thy
servant
Moses,
saying,
If
ye
transgress,
I
will
scatter
you
abroad
among
the
nations:
001:009
But
if
ye
turn
unto
me,
and
keep
my
commandments,
and
do
them;
though
there
were
of
you
cast
out
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
heaven,
yet
will
I
gather
them
from
thence,
and
will
bring
them
unto
the
place
that
I
have
chosen
to
set
my
name
there.
001:010
Now
these
are
thy
servants
and
thy
people,
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
by
thy
great
power,
and
by
thy
strong
hand.
001:011
O
LORD,
I
beseech
thee,
let
now
thine
ear
be
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant,
and
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servants,
who
desire
to
fear
thy
name:
and
prosper,
I
pray
thee,
thy
servant
this
day,
and
grant
him
mercy
in
the
sight
of
this
man.
For
I
was
the
king's
cupbearer.
002:001
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
month
Nisan,
in
the
twentieth
year
of
Artaxerxes
the
king,
that
wine
was
before
him:
and
I
took
up
the
wine,
and
gave
it
unto
the
king.
Now
I
had
not
been
beforetime
sad
in
his
presence.
002:002
Wherefore
the
king
said
unto
me,
Why
is
thy
countenance
sad,
seeing
thou
art
not
sick?
this
is
nothing
else
but
sorrow
of
heart.
Then
I
was
very
sore
afraid,
002:003
And
said
unto
the
king,
Let
the
king
live
for
ever:
why
should
not
my
countenance
be
sad,
when
the
city,
the
place
of
my
fathers'
sepulchres,
lieth
waste,
and
the
gates
thereof
are
consumed
with
fire?
002:004
Then
the
king
said
unto
me,
For
what
dost
thou
make
request?
So
I
prayed
to
the
God
of
heaven.
002:005
And
I
said
unto
the
king,
If
it
please
the
king,
and
if
thy
servant
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight,
that
thou
wouldest
send
me
unto
Judah,
unto
the
city
of
my
fathers'
sepulchres,
that
I
may
build
it.
002:006
And
the
king
said
unto
me,
(the
queen
also
sitting
by
him,)
For
how
long
shall
thy
journey
be?
and
when
wilt
thou
return?
So
it
pleased
the
king
to
send
me;
and
I
set
him
a
time.
002:007
Moreover
I
said
unto
the
king,
If
it
please
the
king,
let
letters
be
given
me
to
the
governors
beyond
the
river,
that
they
may
convey
me
over
till
I
come
into
Judah;
002:008
And
a
letter
unto
Asaph
the
keeper
of
the
king's
forest,
that
he
may
give
me
timber
to
make
beams
for
the
gates
of
the
palace
which
appertained
to
the
house,
and
for
the
wall
of
the
city,
and
for
the
house
that
I
shall
enter
into.
And
the
king
granted
me,
according
to
the
good
hand
of
my
God
upon
me.
002:009
Then
I
came
to
the
governors
beyond
the
river,
and
gave
them
the
king's
letters.
Now
the
king
had
sent
captains
of
the
army
and
horsemen
with
me.
002:010
When
Sanballat
the
Horonite,
and
Tobiah
the
servant,
the
Ammonite,
heard
of
it,
it
grieved
them
exceedingly
that
there
was
come
a
man
to
seek
the
welfare
of
the
children
of
Israel.
002:011
So
I
came
to
Jerusalem,
and
was
there
three
days.
002:012
And
I
arose
in
the
night,
I
and
some
few
men
with
me;
neither
told
I
any
man
what
my
God
had
put
in
my
heart
to
do
at
Jerusalem:
neither
was
there
any
beast
with
me,
save
the
beast
that
I
rode
upon.
002:013
And
I
went
out
by
night
by
the
gate
of
the
valley,
even
before
the
dragon
well,
and
to
the
dung
port,
and
viewed
the
walls
of
Jerusalem,
which
were
broken
down,
and
the
gates
thereof
were
consumed
with
fire.
002:014
Then
I
went
on
to
the
gate
of
the
fountain,
and
to
the
king's
pool:
but
there
was
no
place
for
the
beast
that
was
under
me
to
pass.
002:015
Then
went
I
up
in
the
night
by
the
brook,
and
viewed
the
wall,
and
turned
back,
and
entered
by
the
gate
of
the
valley,
and
so
returned.
002:016
And
the
rulers
knew
not
whither
I
went,
or
what
I
did;
neither
had
I
as
yet
told
it
to
the
Jews,
nor
to
the
priests,
nor
to
the
nobles,
nor
to
the
rulers,
nor
to
the
rest
that
did
the
work.
002:017
Then
said
I
unto
them,
Ye
see
the
distress
that
we
are
in,
how
Jerusalem
lieth
waste,
and
the
gates
thereof
are
burned
with
fire:
come,
and
let
us
build
up
the
wall
of
Jerusalem,
that
we
be
no
more
a
reproach.
002:018
Then
I
told
them
of
the
hand
of
my
God
which
was
good
upon
me;
as
also
the
king's
words
that
he
had
spoken
unto
me.
And
they
said,
Let
us
rise
up
and
build.
So
they
strengthened
their
hands
for
this
good
work.
002:019
But
when
Sanballat
the
Horonite,
and
Tobiah
the
servant,
the
Ammonite,
and
Geshem
the
Arabian,
heard
it,
they
laughed
us
to
scorn,
and
despised
us,
and
said,
What
is
this
thing
that
ye
do?
will
ye
rebel
against
the
king?
002:020
Then
answered
I
them,
and
said
unto
them,
The
God
of
heaven,
he
will
prosper
us;
therefore
we
his
servants
will
arise
and
build:
but
ye
have
no
portion,
nor
right,
nor
memorial,
in
Jerusalem.
003:001
Then
Eliashib
the
high
priest
rose
up
with
his
brethren
the
priests,
and
they
builded
the
sheep
gate;
they
sanctified
it,
and
set
up
the
doors
of
it;
even
unto
the
tower
of
Meah
they
sanctified
it,
unto
the
tower
of
Hananeel.
003:002
And
next
unto
him
builded
the
men
of
Jericho.
And
next
to
them
builded
Zaccur
the
son
of
Imri.
003:003
But
the
fish
gate
did
the
sons
of
Hassenaah
build,
who
also
laid
the
beams
thereof,
and
set
up
the
doors
thereof,
the
locks
thereof,
and
the
bars
thereof.
003:004
And
next
unto
them
repaired
Meremoth
the
son
of
Urijah,
the
son
of
Koz.
And
next
unto
them
repaired
Meshullam
the
son
of
Berechiah,
the
son
of
Meshezabeel.
And
next
unto
them
repaired
Zadok
the
son
of
Baana.
003:005
And
next
unto
them
the
Tekoites
repaired;
but
their
nobles
put
not
their
necks
to
the
work
of
their
LORD.
003:006
Moreover
the
old
gate
repaired
Jehoiada
the
son
of
Paseah,
and
Meshullam
the
son
of
Besodeiah;
they
laid
the
beams
thereof,
and
set
up
the
doors
thereof,
and
the
locks
thereof,
and
the
bars
thereof.
003:007
And
next
unto
them
repaired
Melatiah
the
Gibeonite,
and
Jadon
the
Meronothite,
the
men
of
Gibeon,
and
of
Mizpah,
unto
the
throne
of
the
governor
on
this
side
the
river.
003:008
Next
unto
him
repaired
Uzziel
the
son
of
Harhaiah,
of
the
goldsmiths.
Next
unto
him
also
repaired
Hananiah
the
son
of
one
of
the
apothecaries,
and
they
fortified
Jerusalem
unto
the
broad
wall.
003:009
And
next
unto
them
repaired
Rephaiah
the
son
of
Hur,
the
ruler
of
the
half
part
of
Jerusalem.
003:010
And
next
unto
them
repaired
Jedaiah
the
son
of
Harumaph,
even

and
to
the
going
up

the
corner.
003:032
And
between
the
going
up
of
the
corner
unto
the
sheep
gate
repaired
the
goldsmiths
and
the
merchants.
004:001
But
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
Sanballat
heard
that
we
builded
the
wall,
he
was
wroth,
and
took
great
indignation,
and
mocked
the
Jews.
004:002
And
he
spake
before
his
brethren
and
the
army
of
Samaria,
and
said,
What
do
these
feeble
Jews?
will
they
fortify
themselves?
will
they
sacrifice?
will
they
make
an
end
in
a
day?
will
they
revive
the
stones
out
of
the
heaps
of
the
rubbish
which
are
burned?
004:003
Now
Tobiah
the
Ammonite
was
by
him,
and
he
said,
Even
that
which
they
build,
if
a
fox
go
up,
he
shall
even
break
down
their
stone
wall.
004:004
Hear,
O
our
God;
for
we
are
despised:
and
turn
their
reproach
upon
their
own
head,
and
give
them
for
a
prey
in
the
land
of
captivity:
004:005
And
cover
not
their
iniquity,
and
let
not
their
sin
be
blotted
out
from
before
thee:
for
they
have
provoked
thee
to
anger
before
the
builders.
004:006
So
built
we
the
wall;
and
all
the
wall
was
joined
together
unto
the
half
thereof:
for
the
people
had
a
mind
to
work.
004:007
But
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
Sanballat,
and
Tobiah,
and
the
Arabians,
and
the
Ammonites,
and
the
Ashdodites,
heard
that
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
were
made
up,
and
that
the
breaches
began
to
be
stopped,
then
they
were
very
wroth,
004:008
And
conspired
all
of
them
together
to
come
and
to
fight
against
Jerusalem,
and
to
hinder
it.
004:009
Nevertheless
we
made
our
prayer
unto
our
God,
and
set
a
watch
against
them
day
and
night,
because
of
them.
004:010
And
Judah
said,
The
strength
of
the
bearers
of
burdens
is
decayed,
and
there
is
much
rubbish;
so
that
we
are
not
able
to
build
the
wall.
004:011
And
our
adversaries
said,
They
shall
not
know,
neither
see,
till
we
come
in
the
midst
among
them,
and
slay
them,
and
cause
the
work
to
cease.
004:012
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
the
Jews
which
dwelt
by
them
came,
they
said
unto
us
ten
times,
From
all
places
whence
ye
shall
return
unto
us
they
will
be
upon
you.
004:013
Therefore
set
I
in
the
lower
places
behind
the
wall,
and
on
the
higher
places,
I
even
set
the
people
after
their
families
with
their
swords,
their
spears,
and
their
bows.
004:014
And
I
looked,
and
rose
up,
and
said
unto
the
nobles,
and
to
the
rulers,
and
to
the
rest
of
the
people,
Be
not
ye
afraid
of
them:
remember
the
LORD,
which
is
great
and
terrible,
and
fight
for
your
brethren,
your
sons,
and
your
daughters,
your
wives,
and
your
houses.
004:015
And
it
came
to
pass,
when
our
enemies
heard
that
it
was
known
unto
us,
and
God
had
brought
their
counsel
to
nought,
that
we
returned
all
of
us
to
the
wall,
every
one
unto
his
work.
004:016
And
it
came
to
pass
from
that
time
forth,
that
the
half
of
my
servants
wrought
in
the
work,
and
the
other
half
of
them
held
both
the
spears,
the
shields,
and
the
bows,
and
the
habergeons;
and
the
rulers
were
behind
all
the
house
of
Judah.
004:017
They
which
builded
on
the
wall,
and
they
that
bare
burdens,
with
those
that
laded,
every
one
with
one
of
his
hands
wrought
in
the
work,
and
with
the
other
hand
held
a
weapon.
004:018
For
the
builders,
every
one
had
his
sword
girded
by
his
side,
and
so
builded.
And
he
that
sounded
the
trumpet
was
by
me.
004:019
And
I
said
unto
the
nobles,
and
to
the
rulers,
and
to
the
rest
of
the
people,
The
work
is
great
and
large,
and
we
are
separated
upon
the
wall,
one
far
from
another.
004:020
In
what
place
therefore
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet,
resort
ye
thither
unto
us:
our
God
shall
fight
for
us.
004:021
So
we
laboured
in
the
work:
and
half
of
them
held
the
spears
from
the
rising
of
the
morning
till
the
stars
appeared.
004:022
Likewise
at
the
same
time
said
I
unto
the
people,
Let
every
one
with
his
servant
lodge
within
Jerusalem,
that
in
the
night
they
may
be
a
guard
to
us,
and
labour
on
the
day.
004:023
So
neither
I,
nor
my
brethren,
nor
my
servants,
nor
the
men
of
the
guard
which
followed
me,
none
of
us
put
off
our
clothes,
saving
that
every
one
put
them
off
for
washing.
005:001
And
there
was
a
great
cry
of
the
people
and
of
their
wives
against
their
brethren
the
Jews.
005:002
For
there
were
that
said,
We,
our
sons,
and
our
daughters,
are
many:
therefore
we
take
up
corn
for
them,
that
we
may
eat,
and
live.
005:003
Some
also
there
were
that
said,
We
have
mortgaged
our
lands,
vineyards,
and
houses,
that
we
might
buy
corn,
because
of
the
dearth.
005:004
There
were
also
that
said,
We
have
borrowed
money
for
the
king's
tribute,
and
that
upon
our
lands
and
vineyards.
005:005
Yet
now
our
flesh
is
as
the
flesh
of
our
brethren,
our
children
as
their
children:
and,
lo,
we
bring
into
bondage
our
sons
and
our
daughters
to
be
servants,
and
some
of
our
daughters
are
brought
unto
bondage
already:
neither
is
it
in
our
power
to
redeem
them;
for
other
men
have
our
lands
and
vineyards.
005:006
And
I
was
very
angry
when
I
heard
their
cry
and
these
words.
005:007
Then
I
consulted
with
myself,
and
I
rebuked
the
nobles,
and
the
rulers,
and
said
unto
them,
Ye
exact
usury,
every
one
of
his
brother.
And
I
set
a
great
assembly
against
them.
005:008
And
I
said
unto
them,
We
after
our
ability
have
redeemed
our
brethren
the
Jews,
which
were
sold
unto
the
heathen;
and
will
ye
even
sell
your
brethren?
or
shall
they
be
sold
unto
us?
Then
held
they
their
peace,
and
found
nothing
to
answer.
005:009
Also
I
said,
It
is
not
good
that
ye
do:
ought
ye
not
to
walk
in
the
fear
of
our
God
because
of
the
reproach
of
the
heathen
our
enemies?
005:010
I
likewise,
and
my
brethren,
and
my
servants,
might
exact
of
them
money
and
corn:
I
pray
you,
let
us
leave
off
this
usury.
005:011
Restore,
I
pray
you,
to
them,
even
this
day,
their
lands,
their
vineyards,
their
oliveyards,
and
their
houses,
also
the
hundredth
part
of
the
money,
and
of
the
corn,
the
wine,
and
the
oil,
that
ye
exact
of
them.
005:012
Then
said
they,
We
will
restore
them,
and
will
require
nothing
of
them;
so
will
we
do
as
thou
sayest.
Then
I
called
the
priests,
and
took
an
oath
of
them,
that
they
should
do
according
to
this
promise.
005:013
Also
I
shook
my
lap,
and
said,
So
God
shake
out
every
man
from
his
house,
and
from
his
labour,
that
performeth
not
this
promise,
even
thus
be
he
shaken
out,
and
emptied.
And
all
the
congregation
said,
Amen,
and
praised
the
LORD.
And
the
people
did
according
