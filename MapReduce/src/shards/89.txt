the
good
thereof,
behold,
we
are
servants
in
it:
009:037
And
it
yieldeth
much
increase
unto
the
kings
whom
thou
hast
set
over
us
because
of
our
sins:
also
they
have
dominion
over
our
bodies,
and
over
our
cattle,
at
their
pleasure,
and
we
are
in
great
distress.
009:038
And
because
of
all
this
we
make
a
sure
covenant,
and
write
it;
and

seal

it.

010:028
And
the
rest
of
the
people,
the
priests,
the
Levites,
the
porters,
the
singers,
the
Nethinims,
and
all
they
that
had
separated
themselves
from
the
people
of
the
lands
unto
the
law
of
God,
their
wives,
their
sons,
and
their
daughters,
every
one
having
knowledge,
and
having
understanding;
010:029
They
clave
to
their
brethren,
their
nobles,
and
entered
into
a
curse,
and
into
an
oath,
to
walk
in
God's
law,
which
was
given
by
Moses
the
servant
of
God,
and
to
observe
and
do
all
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
our
Lord,
and
his
judgments
and
his
statutes;
010:030
And
that
we
would
not
give
our
daughters
unto
the
people
of
the
land,
not
take
their
daughters
for
our
sons:
010:031
And
if
the
people
of
the
land
bring
ware
or
any
victuals
on
the
sabbath
day
to
sell,
that
we
would
not
buy
it
of
them
on
the
sabbath,
or
on
the
holy
day:
and
that
we
would
leave
the
seventh
year,
and
the
exaction
of
every
debt.
010:032
Also
we
made
ordinances
for
us,
to
charge
ourselves
yearly
with
the
third
part
of
a
shekel
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
our
God;
010:033
For
the
shewbread,
and
for
the
continual
meat
offering,
and
for
the
continual
burnt
offering,
of
the
sabbaths,
of
the
new
moons,
for
the
set
feasts,
and
for
the
holy
things,
and
for
the
sin
offerings
to
make
an
atonement
for
Israel,
and
for
all
the
work
of
the
house
of
our
God.
010:034
And
we
cast
the
lots
among
the
priests,
the
Levites,
and
the
people,
for
the
wood
offering,
to
bring
it
into
the
house
of
our
God,
after
the
houses
of
our
fathers,
at
times
appointed
year
by
year,
to
burn
upon
the
altar
of
the
LORD
our
God,
as
it
is
written
in
the
law:
010:035
And
to
bring
the
firstfruits
of
our
ground,
and
the
firstfruits
of
all
fruit
of
all
trees,
year
by
year,
unto
the
house
of
the
LORD:
010:036
Also
the
firstborn
of
our
sons,
and
of
our
cattle,
as
it
is
written
in
the
law,
and
the
firstlings
of
our
herds
and
of
our
flocks,
to
bring
to
the
house
of
our
God,
unto
the
priests
that
minister
in
the
house
of
our
God:
010:037
And
that
we
should
bring
the
firstfruits
of
our
dough,
and
our
offerings,
and
the
fruit
of
all
manner
of
trees,
of
wine
and
of
oil,
unto
the
priests,
to
the
chambers
of
the
house
of
our
God;
and
the
tithes
of
our
ground
unto
the
Levites,
that
the
same
Levites
might
have
the
tithes
in
all
the
cities
of
our
tillage.
010:038
And
the
priest
the
son
of
Aaron
shall
be
with
the
Levites,
when
the
Levites
take
tithes:
and
the
Levites
shall
bring
up
the
tithe
of
the
tithes
unto
the
house
of
our
God,
to
the
chambers,
into
the
treasure
house.
010:039
For
the
children
of
Israel
and
the
children
of
Levi
shall
bring
the
offering
of
the
corn,
of
the
new
wine,
and
the
oil,
unto
the
chambers,
where
are
the
vessels
of
the
sanctuary,
and
the
priests
that
minister,
and
the
porters,
and
the
singers:
and
we
will
not
forsake
the
house
of
our
God.
011:001
And
the
rulers
of
the
people
dwelt
at
Jerusalem:
the
rest
of
the
people
also
cast
lots,
to
bring
one
of
ten
to
dwell
in
Jerusalem
the
holy
city,
and
nine
parts
to
dwell
in
other
cities.
011:002
And
the
people
blessed
all
the
men,
that
willingly
offered
themselves
to
dwell
at
Jerusalem.
011:003
Now
these
are
the
chief
of
the
province
that
dwelt
in
Jerusalem:
but
in
the
cities
of
Judah
dwelt
every
one
in
his

in
their

to

Israel,
the
priests,

011:004
And

011:012
And

And

Also

And

God.
011:017
And
Mattaniah

011:019
Moreover
the

011:020
And

and
the
Levites,
were

all
the
cities
of
Judah,
every

011:021
But
the

Ophel:
and
Ziha
and

Of

of
the
house
of

011:023
For
it
was
the
king's
commandment
concerning
them,
that
a
certain
portion
should

the
singers,
due
for
every

011:036
And

012:001
Now

And

were
recorded
chief

the
fathers:
also

priests,
to
the
reign
of
Darius
the
Persian.
012:023
The
sons
of
Levi,
the
chief
of
the
fathers,
were
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles,
even
until
the
days

012:024
And
the

to
praise
and
to
give
thanks,
according

012:025
Mattaniah,

Jozadak,
and
in
the
days
of

the
governor,
and
of
Ezra
the
priest,
the

012:027
And
at
the
dedication
of
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
they
sought
the
Levites
out
of
all
their
places,
to
bring
them
to
Jerusalem,
to
keep
the
dedication
with
gladness,
both
with
thanksgivings,
and
with
singing,
with
cymbals,
psalteries,
and
with
harps.
012:028
And
the
sons
of
the
singers
gathered
themselves
together,
both
out
of
the
plain
country
round
about
Jerusalem,
and
from
the
villages
of
Netophathi;
012:029
Also
from
the
house
of
Gilgal,
and
out
of
the
fields
of
Geba
and
Azmaveth:
for
the
singers
had
builded
them
villages
round
about
Jerusalem.
012:030
And
the
priests
and
the
Levites
purified
themselves,
and
purified
the
people,
and
the
gates,
and
the
wall.
012:031
Then
I
brought
up
the
princes
of
Judah
upon
the
wall,
and
appointed
two
great
companies
of
them
that
gave
thanks,
whereof
one
went
on

hand
upon
the

with
trumpets;
namely,
Zechariah
the
son
of
Jonathan,
the
son
of
Shemaiah,
the
son
of
Mattaniah,
the
son
of
Michaiah,
the
son
of
Zaccur,
the
son
of
Asaph:
012:036
And
his
brethren,
Shemaiah,
and
Azarael,
Milalai,
Gilalai,
Maai,
Nethaneel,
and
Judah,
Hanani,
with
the
musical
instruments
of
David
the
man
of
God,
and
Ezra
the
scribe
before
them.
012:037
And
at
the
fountain
gate,
which
was
over
against
them,
they
went
up
by
the
stairs
of
the
city
of
David,
at
the
going
up
of
the
wall,
above
the
house
of
David,
even
unto
the
water
gate
eastward.
012:038
And
the
other
company
of
them
that
gave
thanks
went
over
against
them,
and
I
after
them,
and
the
half
of
the
people
upon
the
wall,
from
beyond
the
tower
of
the
furnaces
even
unto
the
broad
wall;
012:039
And
from
above
the
gate
of
Ephraim,
and
above
the
old
gate,
and
above
the
fish
gate,
and
the
tower
of
Hananeel,
and
the
tower
of
Meah,
even
unto
the
sheep
gate:
and
they
stood
still
in
the
prison
gate.
012:040
So
stood
the
two
companies
of
them
that
gave
thanks
in
the
house
of
God,
and
I,
and
the
half
of
the
rulers
with
me:
012:041
And
the
priests;
Eliakim,
Maaseiah,
Miniamin,
Michaiah,
Elioenai,
Zechariah,
and
Hananiah,
with
trumpets;
012:042
And
Maaseiah,
and
Shemaiah,
and
Eleazar,
and
Uzzi,
and
Jehohanan,
and
Malchijah,
and
Elam,
and
Ezer.
And
the
singers
sang
loud,
with
Jezrahiah
their
overseer.
012:043
Also
that
day
they
offered
great
sacrifices,
and
rejoiced:
for
God
had
made
them
rejoice
with
great
joy:
the
wives
also
and
the
children
rejoiced:
so
that
the
joy
of
Jerusalem
was
heard
even
afar
off.
012:044
And
at
that
time
were
some
appointed
over
the
chambers
for
the
treasures,
for
the
offerings,
for
the
firstfruits,
and
for
the
tithes,
to
gather
into
them
out
of
the
fields
of
the
cities
the
portions
of
the
law
for
the
priests
and
Levites:
for
Judah
rejoiced
for
the
priests
and
for
the
Levites
that
waited.
012:045
And
both
the
singers
and
the
porters
kept
the
ward
of
their
God,
and
the
ward
of
the
purification,
according
to
the
commandment
of
David,
and
of
Solomon
his
son.
012:046
For
in
the
days
of
David
and
Asaph
of
old
there
were
chief
of
the
singers,
and
songs
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
unto
God.
012:047
And
all
Israel
in
the
days
of
Zerubbabel,
and
in
the
days
of
Nehemiah,
gave
the
portions
of
the
singers
and
the
porters,
every
day
his
portion:
and
they
sanctified
holy
things
unto
the
Levites;
and
the
Levites
sanctified
them
unto
the
children
of
Aaron.
013:001
On
that
day
they
read
in
the
book
of
Moses
in
the
audience
of
the
people;
and
therein
was
found
written,
that
the
Ammonite
and
the
Moabite
should
not
come
into
the
congregation
of
God
for
ever;
013:002
Because
they
met
not
the
children
of
Israel
with
bread
and
with
water,
but
hired
Balaam
against
them,
that
he
should
curse
them:
howbeit
our
God
turned
the
curse
into
a
blessing.
013:003
Now
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
had
heard
the
law,
that
they
separated
from
Israel
all
the
mixed
multitude.
013:004
And
before
this,
Eliashib
the
priest,
having
the
oversight
of
the
chamber
of
the
house
of
our
God,
was
allied
unto
Tobiah:
013:005
And
he
had
prepared
for
him
a
great
chamber,
where
aforetime
they
laid
the
meat
offerings,
the
frankincense,
and
the
vessels,
and
the
tithes
of
the
corn,
the
new
wine,
and
the
oil,
which
was
commanded
to
be
given
to
the
Levites,
and
the
singers,
and
the
porters;
and
the
offerings
of
the
priests.
013:006
But
in
all
this
time
was
not
I
at
Jerusalem:
for
in
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
of
Artaxerxes
king
of
Babylon
came
I
unto
the
king,
and
after
certain
days
obtained
I
leave
of
the
king:
013:007
And
I
came
to
Jerusalem,
and
understood
of
the
evil
that
Eliashib
did
for
Tobiah,
in
preparing
him
a
chamber
in
the
courts
of
the
house
of
God.
013:008
And
it
grieved
me
sore:
therefore
I
cast
forth
all
the
household
stuff
to
Tobiah
out
of
the
chamber.
013:009
Then
I
commanded,
and
they
cleansed
the
chambers:
and
thither
brought
I
again
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
God,
with
the
meat
offering
and
the
frankincense.
013:010
And
I
perceived
that
the
portions
of
the
Levites
had
not
been
given
them:
for
the
Levites
and
the
singers,
that
did
the
work,
were
fled
every
one
to
his
field.
013:011
Then
contended
I
with
the
rulers,
and
said,
Why
is
the
house
of
God
forsaken?
And
I
gathered
them
together,
and
set
them
in
their
place.
013:012
Then
brought
all
Judah
the
tithe
of
the
corn
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
unto
the
treasuries.
013:013
And
I
made
treasurers
over
the
treasuries,
Shelemiah
the
priest,
and
Zadok
the
scribe,
and
of
the
Levites,
Pedaiah:
and
next
to
them
was
Hanan
the
son
of
Zaccur,
the
son
of
Mattaniah:
for
they
were
counted
faithful,
and
their
office
was
to
distribute
unto
their
brethren.
013:014
Remember
me,
O
my
God,
concerning
this,
and
wipe
not
out
my
good
deeds
that
I
have
done
for
the
house
of
my
God,
and
for
the
offices
thereof.
013:015
In
those
days
saw
I
in
Judah
some
treading
wine
presses
on
the
sabbath,
and
bringing
in
sheaves,
and
lading
asses;
as
also
wine,
grapes,
and
figs,
and
all
manner
of
burdens,
which
they
brought
into
Jerusalem
on
the
sabbath
day:
and
I
testified
against
them
in
the
day
wherein
they
sold
victuals.
013:016
There
dwelt
men
of
Tyre
also
therein,
which
brought
fish,
and
all
manner
of
ware,
and
sold
on
the
sabbath
unto
the
children
of
Judah,
and
in
Jerusalem.
013:017
Then
I
contended
with
the
nobles
of
Judah,
and
said
unto
them,
What
evil
thing
is
this
that
ye
do,
and
profane
the
sabbath
day?
013:018
Did
not
your
fathers
thus,
and
did
not
our
God
bring
all
this
evil
upon
us,
and
upon
this
city?
yet
ye
bring
more
wrath
upon
Israel
by
profaning
the
sabbath.
013:019
And
it
came
to
pass,
that
when
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
began
to
be
dark
before
the
sabbath,
I
commanded
that
the
gates
should
be
shut,
and
charged
that
they
should
not
be
opened
till
after
the
sabbath:
and
some
of
my
servants
set
I
at
the
gates,
that
there
should
no
burden
be
brought
in
on
the
sabbath
day.
013:020
So
the
merchants
and
sellers
of
all
kind
of
ware
lodged
without
Jerusalem
once
or
twice.
013:021
Then
I
testified
against
them,
and
said
unto
them,
Why
lodge
ye
about
the
wall?
if
ye
do
so
again,
I
will
lay
hands
on
you.
From
that
time
forth
came
they
no
more
on
the
sabbath.
013:022
And
I
commanded
the
Levites
that
they
should
cleanse
themselves,
and
that
they
should
come
and
keep
the
gates,
to
sanctify
the
sabbath
day.
Remember
me,
O
my
God,
concerning
this
also,
and
spare
me
according
to
the
greatness
of
thy
mercy.
013:023
In
those
days
also
saw
I
Jews
that
had
married
wives
of
Ashdod,
of
Ammon,
and
of
Moab:
013:024
And
their
children
spake
half
in
the
speech
of
Ashdod,
and
could
not
speak
in
the
Jews'
language,
but
according
to
the
language
of
each
people.
013:025
And
I
contended
with
them,
and
cursed
them,
and
smote
certain
of
them,
and
plucked
off
their
hair,
and
made
them
swear
by
God,
saying,
Ye
shall
not
give
your
daughters
unto
their
sons,
nor
take
their
daughters
unto
your
sons,
or
for
yourselves.
013:026
Did
not
Solomon
king
of
Israel
sin
by
these
things?
yet
among
many
nations
was
there
no
king
like
him,
who
was
beloved
of
his
God,
and
God
made
him
king
over
all
Israel:
nevertheless
even
him
did
outlandish
women
cause
to
sin.
013:027
Shall
we
then
hearken
unto
you
to
do
all
this
great
evil,
to
transgress
against
our
God
in
marrying
strange
wives?
013:028
And
one
of
the
sons
of
Joiada,
the
son
of
Eliashib
the
high
priest,
was
son
in
law
to
Sanballat
the
Horonite:
therefore
I
chased
him
from
me.
013:029
Remember
them,
O
my
God,
because
they
have
defiled
the
priesthood,
and
the
covenant
of
the
priesthood,
and
of
the
Levites.
013:030
Thus
cleansed
I
them
from
all
strangers,
and
appointed
the
wards
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
every
one
in
his
business;
013:031
And
for
the
wood
offering,
at
times
appointed,
and
for
the
firstfruits.
Remember
me,
O
my
God,
for
good.
Book
17	Esther
001:001
Now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Ahasuerus,
(this
is
Ahasuerus
which
reigned,
from
India
even
unto
Ethiopia,
over
an
hundred
and
seven
and
twenty
provinces:)
001:002
That
in
those
days,
when
the
king
Ahasuerus
sat
on
the
throne
of
his
kingdom,
which
was
in
Shushan
the
palace,
001:003
In
the
third
year
of
his
reign,
he
made
a
feast
unto
all
his
princes
and
his
servants;
the
power
of
Persia
and
Media,
the
nobles
and
princes
of
the
provinces,
being
before
him:
001:004
When
he
shewed
the
riches
of
his
glorious
kingdom
and
the
honour
of
his
excellent
majesty
many
days,
even
an
hundred
and
fourscore
days.
001:005
And
when
these
days
were
expired,
the
king
made
a
feast
unto
all
the
people
that
were
present
in
Shushan
the
palace,
both
unto
great
and
small,
seven
days,
in
the
court
of
the
garden
of
the
king's
palace;
001:006
Where
were
white,
green,
and
blue,
hangings,
fastened
with
cords
of
fine
linen
and
purple
to
silver
rings
and
pillars
of
marble:
the
beds
were
of
gold
and
silver,
upon
a
pavement
of
red,
and
blue,
and
white,
and
black,
marble.
001:007
And
they
gave
them
drink
in
vessels
of
gold,
(the
vessels
being
diverse
one
from
another,)
and
royal
wine
in
abundance,
according
to
the
state
of
the
king.
001:008
And
the
drinking
was
according
to
the
law;
none
did
compel:
for
so
the
king
had
appointed
to
all
the
officers
of
his
house,
that
they
should
do
according
to
every
man's
pleasure.
001:009
Also
Vashti
the
queen
made
a
feast
for
the
women
in
the
royal
house
which
belonged
to
king
Ahasuerus.
001:010
On
the
seventh
day,
when
the
heart
of
the
king
was
merry
with
wine,
he
commanded
Mehuman,
Biztha,
Harbona,
Bigtha,
and
Abagtha,
Zethar,
and
Carcas,
the
seven
chamberlains
that
served
in
the
presence
of
Ahasuerus
the
king,
001:011
To
bring
Vashti
the
queen
before
the
king
with
the
crown
royal,
to
shew
the
people
and
the
princes
her
beauty:
for
she
was
fair
to
look
on.
001:012
But
the
queen
Vashti
refused
to
come
at
the
king's
commandment
by
his
chamberlains:
therefore
was
the
king
very
wroth,
and
his
anger
burned
in
him.
001:013
Then
the
king
said
to
the
wise
men,
which
knew
the
times,
(for
so
was
the
king's
manner
toward
all
that
knew
law
and
judgment:
001:014
And
the
next
unto
him
was
Carshena,
Shethar,
Admatha,
Tarshish,
Meres,
Marsena,
and
Memucan,
the
seven
princes
of
Persia
and
Media,
which
saw
the
king's
face,
and
which
sat
the
first
in
the
kingdom;)
001:015
What
shall
we
do
unto
the
queen
Vashti
according
to
law,
because
she
hath
not
performed
the
commandment
of
the
king
Ahasuerus
by
the
chamberlains?
001:016
And
Memucan
answered
before
the
king
and
the
princes,
Vashti
the
queen
hath
not
done
wrong
to
the
king
only,
but
also
to
all
the
princes,
and
to
all
the
people
that
are
in
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
Ahasuerus.
001:017
For
this
deed
of
the
queen
shall
come
abroad
unto
all
women,
so
that
they
shall
despise
their
husbands
in
their
eyes,
when
it
shall
be
reported,
The
king
Ahasuerus
commanded
Vashti
the
queen
to
be
brought
in
