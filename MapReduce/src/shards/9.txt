Canaan;
and,
behold,
they
are
in
the
land
of
Goshen.
047:002
And
he
took
some
of
his
brethren,
even
five
men,
and
presented
them
unto
Pharaoh.
047:003
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
his
brethren,
What
is
your
occupation?
And
they
said
unto
Pharaoh,
Thy
servants
are
shepherds,
both
we,
and
also
our
fathers.
047:004
They
said
morever
unto
Pharaoh,
For
to
sojourn
in
the
land
are
we
come;
for
thy
servants
have
no
pasture
for
their
flocks;
for
the
famine
is
sore
in
the
land
of
Canaan:
now
therefore,
we
pray
thee,
let
thy
servants
dwell
in
the
land
of
Goshen.
047:005
And
Pharaoh
spake
unto
Joseph,
saying,
Thy
father
and
thy
brethren
are
come
unto
thee:
047:006
The
land
of
Egypt
is
before
thee;
in
the
best
of
the
land
make
thy
father
and
brethren
to
dwell;
in
the
land
of
Goshen
let
them
dwell:
and
if
thou
knowest
any
men
of
activity
among
them,
then
make
them
rulers
over
my
cattle.
047:007
And
Joseph
brought
in
Jacob
his
father,
and
set
him
before
Pharaoh:
and
Jacob
blessed
Pharaoh.
047:008
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Jacob,
How
old
art
thou?
047:009
And
Jacob
said
unto
Pharaoh,
The
days
of
the
years
of
my
pilgrimage
are
an
hundred
and
thirty
years:
few
and
evil
have
the
days
of
the
years
of
my
life
been,
and
have
not
attained
unto
the
days
of
the
years
of
the
life
of
my
fathers
in
the
days
of
their
pilgrimage.
047:010
And
Jacob
blessed
Pharaoh,
and
went
out
from
before
Pharaoh.
047:011
And
Joseph
placed
his
father
and
his
brethren,
and
gave
them
a
possession
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
in
the
best
of
the
land,
in
the
land
of
Rameses,
as
Pharaoh
had
commanded.
047:012
And
Joseph
nourished
his
father,
and
his
brethren,
and
all
his
father's
household,
with
bread,
according
to
their
families.
047:013
And
there
was
no
bread
in
all
the
land;
for
the
famine
was
very
sore,
so
that
the
land
of
Egypt
and
all
the
land
of
Canaan
fainted
by
reason
of
the
famine.
047:014
And
Joseph
gathered
up
all
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
for
the
corn
which
they
bought:
and
Joseph
brought
the
money
into
Pharaoh's
house.
047:015
And
when
money
failed
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
and
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
all
the
Egyptians
came
unto
Joseph,
and
said,
Give
us
bread:
for
why
should
we
die
in
thy
presence?
for
the
money
faileth.
047:016
And
Joseph
said,
Give
your
cattle;
and
I
will
give
you
for
your
cattle,
if
money
fail.
047:017
And
they
brought
their
cattle
unto
Joseph:
and
Joseph
gave
them
bread
in
exchange
for
horses,
and
for
the
flocks,
and
for
the
cattle
of
the
herds,
and
for
the
asses:
and
he
fed
them
with
bread
for
all
their
cattle
for
that
year.
047:018
When
that
year
was
ended,
they
came
unto
him
the
second
year,
and
said
unto
him,
We
will
not
hide
it
from
my
lord,
how
that
our
money
is
spent;
my
lord
also
hath
our
herds
of
cattle;
there
is
not
ought
left
in
the
sight
of
my
lord,
but
our
bodies,
and
our
lands:
047:019
Wherefore
shall
we
die
before
thine
eyes,
both
we
and
our
land?
buy
us
and
our
land
for
bread,
and
we
and
our
land
will
be
servants
unto
Pharaoh:
and
give
us
seed,
that
we
may
live,
and
not
die,
that
the
land
be
not
desolate.
047:020
And
Joseph
bought
all
the
land
of
Egypt
for
Pharaoh;
for
the
Egyptians
sold
every
man
his
field,
because
the
famine
prevailed
over
them:
so
the
land
became
Pharaoh's.
047:021
And
as
for
the
people,
he
removed
them
to
cities
from
one
end
of
the
borders
of
Egypt
even
to
the
other
end
thereof.
047:022
Only
the
land
of
the
priests
bought
he
not;
for
the
priests
had
a
portion
assigned
them
of
Pharaoh,
and
did
eat
their
portion
which
Pharaoh
gave
them:
wherefore
they
sold
not
their
lands.
047:023
Then
Joseph
said
unto
the
people,
Behold,
I
have
bought
you
this
day
and
your
land
for
Pharaoh:
lo,
here
is
seed
for
you,
and
ye
shall
sow
the
land.
047:024
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
increase,
that
ye
shall
give
the
fifth
part
unto
Pharaoh,
and
four
parts
shall
be
your
own,
for
seed
of
the
field,
and
for
your
food,
and
for
them
of
your
households,
and
for
food
for
your
little
ones.
047:025
And
they
said,
Thou
hast
saved
our
lives:
let
us
find
grace
in
the
sight
of
my
lord,
and
we
will
be
Pharaoh's
servants.
047:026
And
Joseph
made
it
a
law
over
the
land
of
Egypt
unto
this
day,
that
Pharaoh
should
have
the
fifth
part,
except
the
land
of
the
priests
only,
which
became
not
Pharaoh's.
047:027
And
Israel
dwelt
in
the
land
of
Egypt,
in
the
country
of
Goshen;
and
they
had
possessions
therein,
and
grew,
and
multiplied
exceedingly.
047:028
And
Jacob
lived
in
the
land
of
Egypt
seventeen
years:
so
the
whole
age
of
Jacob
was
an
hundred
forty
and
seven
years.
047:029
And
the
time
drew
nigh
that
Israel
must
die:
and
he
called
his
son
Joseph,
and
said
unto
him,
If
now
I
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight,
put,
I
pray
thee,
thy
hand
under
my
thigh,
and
deal
kindly
and
truly
with
me;
bury
me
not,
I
pray
thee,
in
Egypt:
047:030
But
I
will
lie
with
my
fathers,
and
thou
shalt
carry
me
out
of
Egypt,
and
bury
me
in
their
buryingplace.
And
he
said,
I
will
do
as
thou
hast
said.
047:031
And
he
said,
Swear
unto
me.
And
he
sware
unto
him.
And
Israel
bowed
himself
upon
the
bed's
head.
048:001
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things,
that
one
told
Joseph,
Behold,
thy
father
is
sick:
and
he
took
with
him
his
two
sons,
Manasseh
and
Ephraim.
048:002
And
one
told
Jacob,
and
said,
Behold,
thy
son
Joseph
cometh
unto
thee:
and
Israel
strengthened
himself,
and
sat
upon
the
bed.
048:003
And
Jacob
said
unto
Joseph,
God
Almighty
appeared
unto
me
at
Luz
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
blessed
me,
048:004
And
said
unto
me,
Behold,
I
will
make
thee
fruitful,
and
multiply
thee,
and
I
will
make
of
thee
a
multitude
of
people;
and
will
give
this
land
to
thy
seed
after
thee
for
an
everlasting
possession.
048:005
And
now
thy
two
sons,
Ephraim
and
Manasseh,
which
were
born
unto
thee
in
the
land
of
Egypt
before
I
came
unto
thee
into
Egypt,
are
mine;
as
Reuben
and
Simeon,
they
shall
be
mine.
048:006
And
thy
issue,
which
thou
begettest
after
them,
shall
be
thine,
and
shall
be
called
after
the
name
of
their
brethren
in
their
inheritance.
048:007
And
as
for
me,
when
I
came
from
Padan,
Rachel
died
by
me
in
the
land
of
Canaan
in
the
way,
when
yet
there
was
but
a
little
way
to
come
unto
Ephrath:
and
I
buried
her
there
in
the
way
of
Ephrath;
the
same
is
Bethlehem.
048:008
And
Israel
beheld
Joseph's
sons,
and
said,
Who
are
these?
048:009
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
father,
They
are
my
sons,
whom
God
hath
given
me
in
this
place.
And
he
said,
Bring
them,
I
pray
thee,
unto
me,
and
I
will
bless
them.
048:010
Now
the
eyes
of
Israel
were
dim
for
age,
so
that
he
could
not
see.
And
he
brought
them
near
unto
him;
and
he
kissed
them,
and
embraced
them.
048:011
And
Israel
said
unto
Joseph,
I
had
not
thought
to
see
thy
face:
and,
lo,
God
hath
shewed
me
also
thy
seed.
048:012
And
Joseph
brought
them
out
from
between
his
knees,
and
he
bowed
himself
with
his
face
to
the
earth.
048:013
And
Joseph
took
them
both,
Ephraim
in
his
right
hand
toward
Israel's
left
hand,
and
Manasseh
in
his
left
hand
toward
Israel's
right
hand,
and
brought
them
near
unto
him.
048:014
And
Israel
stretched
out
his
right
hand,
and
laid
it
upon
Ephraim's
head,
who
was
the
younger,
and
his
left
hand
upon
Manasseh's
head,
guiding
his
hands
wittingly;
for
Manasseh
was
the
firstborn.
048:015
And
he
blessed
Joseph,
and
said,
God,
before
whom
my
fathers
Abraham
and
Isaac
did
walk,
the
God
which
fed
me
all
my
life
long
unto
this
day,
048:016
The
Angel
which
redeemed
me
from
all
evil,
bless
the
lads;
and
let
my
name
be
named
on
them,
and
the
name
of
my
fathers
Abraham
and
Isaac;
and
let
them
grow
into
a
multitude
in
the
midst
of
the
earth.
048:017
And
when
Joseph
saw
that
his
father
laid
his
right
hand
upon
the
head
of
Ephraim,
it
displeased
him:
and
he
held
up
his
father's
hand,
to
remove
it
from
Ephraim's
head
unto
Manasseh's
head.
048:018
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
father,
Not
so,
my
father:
for
this
is
the
firstborn;
put
thy
right
hand
upon
his
head.
048:019
And
his
father
refused,
and
said,
I
know
it,
my
son,
I
know
it:
he
also
shall
become
a
people,
and
he
also
shall
be
great:
but
truly
his
younger
brother
shall
be
greater
than
he,
and
his
seed
shall
become
a
multitude
of
nations.
048:020
And
he
blessed
them
that
day,
saying,
In
thee
shall
Israel
bless,
saying,
God
make
thee
as
Ephraim
and
as
Manasseh:
and
he
set
Ephraim
before
Manasseh.
048:021
And
Israel
said
unto
Joseph,
Behold,
I
die:
but
God
shall
be
with
you,
and
bring
you
again
unto
the
land
of
your
fathers.
048:022
Moreover
I
have
given
to
thee
one
portion
above
thy
brethren,
which
I
took
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Amorite
with
my
sword
and
with
my
bow.
049:001
And
Jacob
called
unto
his
sons,
and
said,
Gather
yourselves
together,
that
I
may
tell
you
that
which
shall
befall
you
in
the
last
days.
049:002
Gather
yourselves
together,
and
hear,
ye
sons
of
Jacob;
and
hearken
unto
Israel
your
father.
049:003
Reuben,
thou
art
my
firstborn,
my
might,
and
the
beginning
of
my
strength,
the
excellency
of
dignity,
and
the
excellency
of
power:
049:004
Unstable
as
water,
thou
shalt
not
excel;
because
thou
wentest
up
to
thy
father's
bed;
then
defiledst
thou
it:
he
went
up
to
my
couch.
049:005
Simeon
and
Levi
are
brethren;
instruments
of
cruelty
are
in
their
habitations.
049:006
O
my
soul,
come
not
thou
into
their
secret;
unto
their
assembly,
mine
honour,
be
not
thou
united:
for
in
their
anger
they
slew
a
man,
and
in
their
selfwill
they
digged
down
a
wall.
049:007
Cursed
be
their
anger,
for
it
was
fierce;
and
their
wrath,
for
it
was
cruel:
I
will
divide
them
in
Jacob,
and
scatter
them
in
Israel.
049:008
Judah,
thou
art
he
whom
thy
brethren
shall
praise:
thy
hand
shall
be
in
the
neck
of
thine
enemies;
thy
father's
children
shall
bow
down
before
thee.
049:009
Judah
is
a
lion's
whelp:
from
the
prey,
my
son,
thou
art
gone
up:
he
stooped
down,
he
couched
as
a
lion,
and
as
an
old
lion;
who
shall
rouse
him
up?
049:010
The
sceptre
shall
not
depart
from
Judah,
nor
a
lawgiver
from
between
his
feet,
until
Shiloh
come;
and
unto
him
shall
the
gathering
of
the
people
be.
049:011
Binding
his
foal
unto
the
vine,
and
his
ass's
colt
unto
the
choice
vine;
he
washed
his
garments
in
wine,
and
his
clothes
in
the
blood
of
grapes:
049:012
His
eyes
shall
be
red
with
wine,
and
his
teeth
white
with
milk.
049:013
Zebulun
shall
dwell
at
the
haven
of
the
sea;
and
he
shall
be
for
an
haven
of
ships;
and
his
border
shall
be
unto
Zidon.
049:014
Issachar
is
a
strong
ass
couching
down
between
two
burdens:
049:015
And
he
saw
that
rest
was
good,
and
the
land
that
it
was
pleasant;
and
bowed
his
shoulder
to
bear,
and
became
a
servant
unto
tribute.
049:016
Dan
shall
judge
his
people,
as
one
of
the
tribes
of
Israel.
049:017
Dan
shall
be
a
serpent
by
the
way,
an
adder
in
the
path,
that
biteth
the
horse
heels,
so
that
his
rider
shall
fall
backward.
049:018
I
have
waited
for
thy
salvation,
O
LORD.
049:019
Gad,
a
troop
shall
overcome
him:
but
he
shall
overcome
at
the
last.
049:020
Out
of
Asher
his
bread
shall
be
fat,
and
he
shall
yield
royal
dainties.
049:021
Naphtali
is
a
hind
let
loose:
he
giveth
goodly
words.
049:022
Joseph
is
a
fruitful
bough,
even
a
fruitful
bough
by
a
well;
whose
branches
run
over
the
wall:
049:023
The
archers
have
sorely
grieved
him,
and
shot
at
him,
and
hated
him:
049:024
But
his
bow
abode
in
strength,
and
the
arms
of
his
hands
were
made
strong
by
the
hands
of
the
mighty
God
of
Jacob;
(from
thence
is
the
shepherd,
the
stone
of
Israel:)
049:025
Even
by
the
God
of
thy
father,
who
shall
help
thee;
and
by
the
Almighty,
who
shall
bless
thee
with
blessings
of
heaven
above,
blessings
of
the
deep
that
lieth
under,
blessings
of
the
breasts,
and
of
the
womb:
049:026
The
blessings
of
thy
father
have
prevailed
above
the
blessings
of
my
progenitors
unto
the
utmost
bound
of
the
everlasting
hills:
they
shall
be
on
the
head
of
Joseph,
and
on
the
crown
of
the
head
of
him
that
was
separate
from
his
brethren.
049:027
Benjamin
shall
ravin
as
a
wolf:
in
the
morning
he
shall
devour
the
prey,
and
at
night
he
shall
divide
the
spoil.
049:028
All
these
are
the
twelve
tribes
of
Israel:
and
this
is
it
that
their
father
spake
unto
them,
and
blessed
them;
every
one
according
to
his
blessing
he
blessed
them.
049:029
And
he
charged
them,
and
said
unto
them,
I
am
to
be
gathered
unto
my
people:
bury
me
with
my
fathers
in
the
cave
that
is
in
the
field
of
Ephron
the
Hittite,
049:030
In
the
cave
that
is
in
the
field
of
Machpelah,
which
is
before
Mamre,
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
which
Abraham
bought
with
the
field
of
Ephron
the
Hittite
for
a
possession
of
a
buryingplace.
049:031
There
they
buried
Abraham
and
Sarah
his
wife;
there
they
buried
Isaac
and
Rebekah
his
wife;
and
there
I
buried
Leah.
049:032
The
purchase
of
the
field
and
of
the
cave
that
is
therein
was
from
the
children
of
Heth.
049:033
And
when
Jacob
had
made
an
end
of
commanding
his
sons,
he
gathered
up
his
feet
into
the
bed,
and
yielded
up
the
ghost,
and
was
gathered
unto
his
people.
050:001
And
Joseph
fell
upon
his
father's
face,
and
wept
upon
him,
and
kissed
him.
050:002
And
Joseph
commanded
his
servants
the
physicians
to
embalm
his
father:
and
the
physicians
embalmed
Israel.
050:003
And
forty
days
were
fulfilled
for
him;
for
so
are
fulfilled
the
days
of
those
which
are
embalmed:
and
the
Egyptians
mourned
for
him
threescore
and
ten
days.
050:004
And
when
the
days
of
his
mourning
were
past,
Joseph
spake
unto
the
house
of
Pharaoh,
saying,
If
now
I
have
found
grace
in
your
eyes,
speak,
I
pray
you,
in
the
ears
of
Pharaoh,
saying,
050:005
My
father
made
me
swear,
saying,
Lo,
I
die:
in
my
grave
which
I
have
digged
for
me
in
the
land
of
Canaan,
there
shalt
thou
bury
me.
Now
therefore
let
me
go
up,
I
pray
thee,
and
bury
my
father,
and
I
will
come
again.
050:006
And
Pharaoh
said,
Go
up,
and
bury
thy
father,
according
as
he
made
thee
swear.
050:007
And
Joseph
went
up
to
bury
his
father:
and
with
him
went
up
all
the
servants
of
Pharaoh,
the
elders
of
his
house,
and
all
the
elders
of
the
land
of
Egypt,
050:008
And
all
the
house
of
Joseph,
and
his
brethren,
and
his
father's
house:
only
their
little
ones,
and
their
flocks,
and
their
herds,
they
left
in
the
land
of
Goshen.
050:009
And
there
went
up
with
him
both
chariots
and
horsemen:
and
it
was
a
very
great
company.
050:010
And
they
came
to
the
threshingfloor
of
Atad,
which
is
beyond
Jordan,
and
there
they
mourned
with
a
great
and
very
sore
lamentation:
and
he
made
a
mourning
for
his
father
seven
days.
050:011
And
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
land,
the
Canaanites,
saw
the
mourning
in
the
floor
of
Atad,
they
said,
This
is
a
grievous
mourning
to
the
Egyptians:
wherefore
the
name
of
it
was
called
Abelmizraim,
which
is
beyond
Jordan.
050:012
And
his
sons
did
unto
him
according
as
he
commanded
them:
050:013
For
his
sons
carried
him
into
the
land
of
Canaan,
and
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
the
field
of
Machpelah,
which
Abraham
bought
with
the
field
for
a
possession
of
a
buryingplace
of
Ephron
the
Hittite,
before
Mamre.
050:014
And
Joseph
returned
into
Egypt,
he,
and
his
brethren,
and
all
that
went
up
with
him
to
bury
his
father,
after
he
had
buried
his
father.
050:015
And
when
Joseph's
brethren
saw
that
their
father
was
dead,
they
said,
Joseph
will
peradventure
hate
us,
and
will
certainly
requite
us
all
the
evil
which
we
did
unto
him.
050:016
And
they
sent
a
messenger
unto
Joseph,
saying,
Thy
father
did
command
before
he
died,
saying,
050:017
So
shall
ye
say
unto
Joseph,
Forgive,
I
pray
thee
now,
the
trespass
of
thy
brethren,
and
their
sin;
for
they
did
unto
thee
evil:
and
now,
we
pray
thee,
forgive
the
trespass
of
the
servants
of
the
God
of
thy
father.
And
Joseph
wept
when
they
spake
unto
him.
050:018
And
his
brethren
also
went
and
fell
down
before
his
face;
and
they
said,
Behold,
we
be
thy
servants.
050:019
And
Joseph
said
unto
them,
Fear
not:
for
am
I
in
the
place
of
God?
050:020
But
as
for
you,
ye
thought
evil
against
me;
but
God
meant
it
unto
good,
to
bring
to
pass,
as
it
is
this
day,
to
save
much
people
alive.
050:021
Now
therefore
fear
ye
not:
I
will
nourish
you,
and
your
little
ones.
And
he
comforted
them,
and
spake
kindly
unto
them.
050:022
And
Joseph
dwelt
in
Egypt,
he,
and
his
father's
house:
and
Joseph
lived
an
hundred
and
ten
years.
050:023
And
Joseph
saw
Ephraim's
children
of
the
third
generation:
the
children
also
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
were
brought
up
upon
Joseph's
knees.
050:024
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
brethren,
I
die:
and
God
will
surely
visit
you,
and
bring
you
out
of
this
land
unto
the
land
which
he
sware
to
Abraham,
to
Isaac,
and
to
Jacob.
050:025
And
Joseph
took
an
oath
of
the
children
of
Israel,
saying,
God
will
surely
visit
you,
and
ye
shall
carry
up
my
bones
from
hence.
050:026
So
Joseph
died,
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
old:
and
they
embalmed
him,
and
he
was
put
in
a
coffin
in
Egypt.
Book
02	Exodus
001:001
Now
these
are
the
names
of
the
children
of
Israel,
which
came
into
Egypt;
every
man
and
his
household
came
with
Jacob.
001:002
Reuben,
Simeon,
Levi,
and
Judah,
001:003
Issachar,
Zebulun,
and
Benjamin,
001:004
Dan,
and
Naphtali,
Gad,
and
Asher.
001:005
And
all
the
souls
that
came
out
of
the
loins
of
Jacob
were
seventy
souls:
for
Joseph
was
in
Egypt
already.
001:006
And
Joseph
died,
and
all
his
brethren,
and
all
that
generation.
001:007
And
the
children
of
Israel
were
fruitful,
and
increased
abundantly,
and
multiplied,
and
waxed
exceeding
mighty;
and
the
land
was
filled
with
them.
001:008
Now
there
arose
up
a
new
king
over
Egypt,
which
knew
not
Joseph.
001:009
And
he
said
unto
his
people,
Behold,
the
people
of
the
children
of
Israel
are
more
and
mightier
than
we:
001:010
Come
on,
let
us
deal
wisely
with
them;
lest
they
multiply,
and
it
come
to
pass,
that,
when
there
falleth
out
any
war,
they
join
also
unto
our
enemies,
and
fight
against
us,
and
so
get
them
up
out
of
the
land.
001:011
Therefore
they
did
set
over
them
taskmasters
to
afflict
them
with
their
burdens.
And
they
built
for
Pharaoh
treasure
cities,
Pithom
and
Raamses.
001:012
But
the
more
they
afflicted
them,
the
more
they
multiplied
and
grew.
And
they
were
grieved
because
of
the
children
of
Israel.
001:013
And
the
Egyptians
made
the
children
of
Israel
to
serve
with
rigour:
001:014
And
they
made
their
lives
bitter
with
hard
bondage,
in
morter,
and
in
brick,
and
in
all
manner
of
service
in
the
field:
all
their
service,
wherein
they
made
them
serve,
was
with
rigour.
001:015
And
the
king
of
Egypt
spake
to
the
Hebrew
midwives,
of
which
the
name
of
the
one
was
Shiphrah,
and
the
name
of
the
other
Puah:
001:016
And
he
said,
When
ye
do
the
office
of
a
midwife
to
the
Hebrew
women,
and
see
them
upon
the
stools;
if
it
be
a
son,
then
ye
shall
kill
him:
but
if
it
be
a
daughter,
then
she
shall
live.
001:017
But
the
midwives
feared
God,
and
did
not
as
the
king
of
Egypt
commanded
them,
but
saved
the
men
children
alive.
001:018
And
the
king
of
Egypt
called
for
the
midwives,
and
said
unto
them,
Why
have
ye
done
this
thing,
and
have
saved
the
men
children
alive?
001:019
And
the
midwives
said
unto
Pharaoh,
Because
the
Hebrew
women
are
not
as
the
Egyptian
women;
for
they
are
lively,
and
are
delivered
ere
the
midwives
come
in
unto
them.
001:020
Therefore
God
dealt
well
with
the
midwives:
and
the
people
multiplied,
and
waxed
very
mighty.
001:021
And
it
came
to
pass,
because
the
midwives
feared
God,
that
he
made
them
houses.
001:022
And
Pharaoh
charged
all
his
people,
saying,
Every
son
that
is
born
ye
shall
cast
into
the
river,
and
every
daughter
ye
shall
save
alive.
002:001
And
there
went
a
man
of
the
house
of
Levi,
and
took
to
wife
a
daughter
of
Levi.
002:002
And
the
woman
conceived,
and
bare
a
son:
and
when
she
saw
him
that
he
was
a
goodly
child,
she
hid
him
three
months.
002:003
And
when
she
could
not
longer
hide
him,
she
took
for
him
an
ark
of
bulrushes,
and
daubed
it
with
slime
and
with
pitch,
and
put
the
child
therein;
and
she
laid
it
in
the
flags
by
the
river's
brink.
002:004
And
his
sister
stood
afar
off,
to
wit
what
would
be
done
to
him.
002:005
And
the
daughter
of
Pharaoh
came
down
to
wash
herself
at
the
river;
and
her
maidens
walked
along
by
the
river's
side;
and
when
she
saw
the
ark
among
the
flags,
she
sent
her
maid
to
fetch
it.
002:006
And
when
she
had
opened
it,
she
saw
the
child:
and,
behold,
the
babe
wept.
And
she
had
compassion
on
him,
and
said,
This
is
one
of
the
Hebrews'
children.
002:007
Then
said
his
sister
to
Pharaoh's
daughter,
Shall
I
go
and
call
to
thee
a
nurse
of
the
Hebrew
women,
that
she
may
nurse
the
child
for
thee?
002:008
And
Pharaoh's
daughter
said
to
her,
Go.
And
the
maid
went
and
called
the
child's
mother.
002:009
And
Pharaoh's
daughter
said
unto
her,
Take
this
child
away,
and
nurse
it
for
me,
and
I
will
give
thee
thy
wages.
And
the
women
took
the
child,
and
nursed
it.
002:010
And
the
child
grew,
and
she
brought
him
unto
Pharaoh's
daughter,
and
he
became
her
son.
And
she
called
his
name
Moses:
and
she
said,
Because
I
drew
him
out
of
the
water.
002:011
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days,
when
Moses
was
grown,
that
he
went
out
unto
his
brethren,
and
looked
on
their
burdens:
and
he
spied
an
Egyptian
smiting
an
Hebrew,
one
of
his
brethren.
002:012
And
he
looked
this
way
and
that
way,
and
when
he
saw
that
there
was
no
man,
he
slew
the
Egyptian,
and
hid
him
in
the
sand.
002:013
And
when
he
went
out
the
second
day,
behold,
two
men
of
the
Hebrews
strove
together:
and
he
said
to
him
that
did
the
wrong,
Wherefore
smitest
thou
thy
fellow?
002:014
And
he
said,
Who
made
thee
a
prince
and
a
judge
over
us?
intendest
thou
to
kill
me,
as
thou
killedst
the
Egyptian?
And
Moses
feared,
and
said,
Surely
this
thing
is
known.
002:015
Now
when
Pharaoh
heard
this
thing,
he
sought
to
slay
Moses.
But
Moses
fled
from
the
face
of
Pharaoh,
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
Midian:
and
he
sat
down
by
a
well.
002:016
Now
the
priest
of
Midian
had
seven
daughters:
and
they
came
and
drew
water,
and
filled
the
troughs
to
water
their
father's
flock.
002:017
And
the
shepherds
came
and
drove
them
