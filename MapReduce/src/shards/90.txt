before
him,
but
she
came
not.
001:018
Likewise
shall
the
ladies
of
Persia
and
Media
say
this
day
unto
all
the
king's
princes,
which
have
heard
of
the
deed
of
the
queen.
Thus
shall
there
arise
too
much
contempt
and
wrath.
001:019
If
it
please
the
king,
let
there
go
a
royal
commandment
from
him,
and
let
it
be
written
among
the
laws
of
the
Persians
and
the
Medes,
that
it
be
not
altered,
That
Vashti
come
no
more
before
king
Ahasuerus;
and
let
the
king
give
her
royal
estate
unto
another
that
is
better
than
she.
001:020
And
when
the
king's
decree
which
he
shall
make
shall
be
published
throughout
all
his
empire,
(for
it
is
great,)
all
the
wives
shall
give
to
their
husbands
honour,
both
to
great
and
small.
001:021
And
the
saying
pleased
the
king
and
the
princes;
and
the
king
did
according
to
the
word
of
Memucan:
001:022
For
he
sent
letters
into
all
the
king's
provinces,
into
every
province
according
to
the
writing
thereof,
and
to
every
people
after
their
language,
that
every
man
should
bear
rule
in
his
own
house,
and
that
it
should
be
published
according
to
the
language
of
every
people.
002:001
After
these
things,
when
the
wrath
of
king
Ahasuerus
was
appeased,
he
remembered
Vashti,
and
what
she
had
done,
and
what
was
decreed
against
her.
002:002
Then
said
the
king's
servants
that
ministered
unto
him,
Let
there
be
fair
young
virgins
sought
for
the
king:
002:003
And
let
the
king
appoint
officers
in
all
the
provinces
of
his
kingdom,
that
they
may
gather
together
all
the
fair
young
virgins
unto
Shushan
the
palace,
to
the
house
of
the
women,
unto
the
custody
of
Hege
the
king's
chamberlain,
keeper
of
the
women;
and
let
their
things
for
purification
be
given
them:
002:004
And
let
the
maiden
which
pleaseth
the
king
be
queen
instead
of
Vashti.
And
the
thing
pleased
the
king;
and
he
did
so.
002:005
Now
in
Shushan
the
palace
there
was
a
certain
Jew,
whose
name
was
Mordecai,
the
son
of
Jair,
the
son
of
Shimei,
the
son
of
Kish,
a
Benjamite;
002:006
Who
had
been
carried
away
from
Jerusalem
with
the
captivity
which
had
been
carried
away
with
Jeconiah
king
of
Judah,
whom
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
Babylon
had
carried
away.
002:007
And
he
brought
up
Hadassah,
that
is,
Esther,
his
uncle's
daughter:
for
she
had
neither
father
nor
mother,
and
the
maid
was
fair
and
beautiful;
whom
Mordecai,
when
her
father
and
mother
were
dead,
took
for
his
own
daughter.
002:008
So
it
came
to
pass,
when
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
was
heard,
and
when
many
maidens
were
gathered
together
unto
Shushan
the
palace,
to
the
custody
of
Hegai,
that
Esther
was
brought
also
unto
the
king's
house,
to
the
custody
of
Hegai,
keeper
of
the
women.
002:009
And
the
maiden
pleased
him,
and
she
obtained
kindness
of
him;
and
he
speedily
gave
her
her
things
for
purification,
with
such
things
as
belonged
to
her,
and
seven
maidens,
which
were
meet
to
be
given
her,
out
of
the
king's
house:
and
he
preferred
her
and
her
maids
unto
the
best
place
of
the
house
of
the
women.
002:010
Esther
had
not
shewed
her
people
nor
her
kindred:
for
Mordecai
had
charged
her
that
she
should
not
shew
it.
002:011
And
Mordecai
walked
every
day
before
the
court
of
the
women's
house,
to
know
how
Esther
did,
and
what
should
become
of
her.
002:012
Now
when
every
maid's
turn
was
come
to
go
in
to
king
Ahasuerus,
after
that
she
had
been
twelve
months,
according
to
the
manner
of
the
women,
(for
so
were
the
days
of
their
purifications
accomplished,
to
wit,
six
months
with
oil
of
myrrh,
and
six
months
with
sweet
odours,
and
with
other
things
for
the
purifying
of
the
women;)
002:013
Then
thus
came
every
maiden
unto
the
king;
whatsoever
she
desired
was
given
her
to
go
with
her
out
of
the
house
of
the
women
unto
the
king's
house.
002:014
In
the
evening
she
went,
and
on
the
morrow
she
returned
into
the
second
house
of
the
women,
to
the
custody
of
Shaashgaz,
the
king's
chamberlain,
which
kept
the
concubines:
she
came
in
unto
the
king
no
more,
except
the
king
delighted
in
her,
and
that
she
were
called
by
name.
002:015
Now
when
the
turn
of
Esther,
the
daughter
of
Abihail
the
uncle
of
Mordecai,
who
had
taken
her
for
his
daughter,
was
come
to
go
in
unto
the
king,
she
required
nothing
but
what
Hegai
the
king's
chamberlain,
the
keeper
of
the
women,
appointed.
And
Esther
obtained
favour
in
the
sight
of
all
them
that
looked
upon
her.
002:016
So
Esther
was
taken
unto
king
Ahasuerus
into
his
house
royal
in
the
tenth
month,
which
is
the
month
Tebeth,
in
the
seventh
year
of
his
reign.
002:017
And
the
king
loved
Esther
above
all
the
women,
and
she
obtained
grace
and
favour
in
his
sight
more
than
all
the
virgins;
so
that
he
set
the
royal
crown
upon
her
head,
and
made
her
queen
instead
of
Vashti.
002:018
Then
the
king
made
a
great
feast
unto
all
his
princes
and
his
servants,
even
Esther's
feast;
and
he
made
a
release
to
the
provinces,
and
gave
gifts,
according
to
the
state
of
the
king.
002:019
And
when
the
virgins
were
gathered
together
the
second
time,
then
Mordecai
sat
in
the
king's
gate.
002:020
Esther
had
not
yet
shewed
her
kindred
nor
her
people;
as
Mordecai
had
charged
her:
for
Esther
did
the
commandment
of
Mordecai,
like
as
when
she
was
brought
up
with
him.
002:021
In
those
days,
while
Mordecai
sat
in
the
king's
gate,
two
of
the
king's
chamberlains,
Bigthan
and
Teresh,
of
those
which
kept
the
door,
were
wroth,
and
sought
to
lay
hands
on
the
king
Ahasuerus.
002:022
And
the
thing
was
known
to
Mordecai,
who
told
it
unto
Esther
the
queen;
and
Esther
certified
the
king
thereof
in
Mordecai's
name.
002:023
And
when
inquisition
was
made
of
the
matter,
it
was
found
out;
therefore
they
were
both
hanged
on
a
tree:
and
it
was
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
before
the
king.
003:001
After
these
things
did
king
Ahasuerus
promote
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite,
and
advanced
him,
and
set
his
seat
above
all
the
princes
that
were
with
him.
003:002
And
all
the
king's
servants,
that
were
in
the
king's
gate,
bowed,
and
reverenced
Haman:
for
the
king
had
so
commanded
concerning
him.
But
Mordecai
bowed
not,
nor
did
him
reverence.
003:003
Then
the
king's
servants,
which
were
in
the
king's
gate,
said
unto
Mordecai,
Why
transgressest
thou
the
king's
commandment?
003:004
Now
it
came
to
pass,
when
they
spake
daily
unto
him,
and
he
hearkened
not
unto
them,
that
they
told
Haman,
to
see
whether
Mordecai's
matters
would
stand:
for
he
had
told
them
that
he
was
a
Jew.
003:005
And
when
Haman
saw
that
Mordecai
bowed
not,
nor
did
him
reverence,
then
was
Haman
full
of
wrath.
003:006
And
he
thought
scorn
to
lay
hands
on
Mordecai
alone;
for
they
had
shewed
him
the
people
of
Mordecai:
wherefore
Haman
sought
to
destroy
all
the
Jews
that
were
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
of
Ahasuerus,
even
the
people
of
Mordecai.
003:007
In
the
first
month,
that
is,
the
month
Nisan,
in
the
twelfth
year
of
king
Ahasuerus,
they
cast
Pur,
that
is,
the
lot,
before
Haman
from
day
to
day,
and
from
month
to
month,
to
the
twelfth
month,
that
is,
the
month
Adar.
003:008
And
Haman
said
unto
king
Ahasuerus,
There
is
a
certain
people
scattered
abroad
and
dispersed
among
the
people
in
all
the
provinces
of
thy
kingdom;
and
their
laws
are
diverse
from
all
people;
neither
keep
they
the
king's
laws:
therefore
it
is
not
for
the
king's
profit
to
suffer
them.
003:009
If
it
please
the
king,
let
it
be
written
that
they
may
be
destroyed:
and
I
will
pay
ten
thousand
talents
of
silver
to
the
hands
of
those
that
have
the
charge
of
the
business,
to
bring
it
into
the
king's
treasuries.
003:010
And
the
king
took
his
ring
from
his
hand,
and
gave
it
unto
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite,
the
Jews'
enemy.
003:011
And
the
king
said
unto
Haman,
The
silver
is
given
to
thee,
the
people
also,
to
do
with
them
as
it
seemeth
good
to
thee.
003:012
Then
were
the
king's
scribes
called
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
first
month,
and
there
was
written
according
to
all
that
Haman
had
commanded
unto
the
king's
lieutenants,
and
to
the
governors
that
were
over
every
province,
and
to
the
rulers
of
every
people
of
every
province
according
to
the
writing
thereof,
and
to
every
people
after
their
language;
in
the
name
of
king
Ahasuerus
was
it
written,
and
sealed
with
the
king's
ring.
003:013
And
the
letters
were
sent
by
posts
into
all
the
king's
provinces,
to
destroy,
to
kill,
and
to
cause
to
perish,
all
Jews,
both
young
and
old,
little
children
and
women,
in
one
day,
even
upon
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
twelfth
month,
which
is
the
month
Adar,
and
to
take
the
spoil
of
them
for
a
prey.
003:014
The
copy
of
the
writing
for
a
commandment
to
be
given
in
every
province
was
published
unto
all
people,
that
they
should
be
ready
against
that
day.
003:015
The
posts
went
out,
being
hastened
by
the
king's
commandment,
and
the
decree
was
given
in
Shushan
the
palace.
And
the
king
and
Haman
sat
down
to
drink;
but
the
city
Shushan
was
perplexed.
004:001
When
Mordecai
perceived
all
that
was
done,
Mordecai
rent
his
clothes,
and
put
on
sackcloth
with
ashes,
and
went
out
into
the
midst
of
the
city,
and
cried
with
a
loud
and
a
bitter
cry;
004:002
And
came
even
before
the
king's
gate:
for
none
might
enter
into
the
king's
gate
clothed
with
sackcloth.
004:003
And
in
every
province,
whithersoever
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
came,
there
was
great
mourning
among
the
Jews,
and
fasting,
and
weeping,
and
wailing;
and
many
lay
in
sackcloth
and
ashes.
004:004
So
Esther's
maids
and
her
chamberlains
came
and
told
it
her.
Then
was
the
queen
exceedingly
grieved;
and
she
sent
raiment
to
clothe
Mordecai,
and
to
take
away
his
sackcloth
from
him:
but
he
received
it
not.
004:005
Then
called
Esther
for
Hatach,
one
of
the
king's
chamberlains,
whom
he
had
appointed
to
attend
upon
her,
and
gave
him
a
commandment
to
Mordecai,
to
know
what
it
was,
and
why
it
was.
004:006
So
Hatach
went
forth
to
Mordecai
unto
the
street
of
the
city,
which
was
before
the
king's
gate.
004:007
And
Mordecai
told
him
of
all
that
had
happened
unto
him,
and
of
the
sum
of
the
money
that
Haman
had
promised
to
pay
to
the
king's
treasuries
for
the
Jews,
to
destroy
them.
004:008
Also
he
gave
him
the
copy
of
the
writing
of
the
decree
that
was
given
at
Shushan
to
destroy
them,
to
shew
it
unto
Esther,
and
to
declare
it
unto
her,
and
to
charge
her
that
she
should
go
in
unto
the
king,
to
make
supplication
unto
him,
and
to
make
request
before
him
for
her
people.
004:009
And
Hatach
came
and
told
Esther
the
words
of
Mordecai.
004:010
Again
Esther
spake
unto
Hatach,
and
gave
him
commandment
unto
Mordecai;
004:011
All
the
king's
servants,
and
the
people
of
the
king's
provinces,
do
know,
that
whosoever,
whether
man
or
women,
shall
come
unto
the
king
into
the
inner
court,
who
is
not
called,
there
is
one
law
of
his
to
put
him
to
death,
except
such
to
whom
the
king
shall
hold
out
the
golden
sceptre,
that
he
may
live:
but
I
have
not
been
called
to
come
in
unto
the
king
these
thirty
days.
004:012
And
they
told
to
Mordecai
Esther's
words.
004:013
Then
Mordecai
commanded
to
answer
Esther,
Think
not
with
thyself
that
thou
shalt
escape
in
the
king's
house,
more
than
all
the
Jews.
004:014
For
if
thou
altogether
holdest
thy
peace
at
this
time,
then
shall
there
enlargement
and
deliverance
arise
to
the
Jews
from
another
place;
but
thou
and
thy
father's
house
shall
be
destroyed:
and
who
knoweth
whether
thou
art
come
to
the
kingdom
for
such
a
time
as
this?
004:015
Then
Esther
bade
them
return
Mordecai
this
answer,
004:016
Go,
gather
together
all
the
Jews
that
are
present
in
Shushan,
and
fast
ye
for
me,
and
neither
eat
nor
drink
three
days,
night
or
day:
I
also
and
my
maidens
will
fast
likewise;
and
so
will
I
go
in
unto
the
king,
which
is
not
according
to
the
law:
and
if
I
perish,
I
perish.
004:017
So
Mordecai
went
his
way,
and
did
according
to
all
that
Esther
had
commanded
him.
005:001
Now
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
day,
that
Esther
put
on
her
royal
apparel,
and
stood
in
the
inner
court
of
the
king's
house,
over
against
the
king's
house:
and
the
king
sat
upon
his
royal
throne
in
the
royal
house,
over
against
the
gate
of
the
house.
005:002
And
it
was
so,
when
the
king
saw
Esther
the
queen
standing
in
the
court,
that
she
obtained
favour
in
his
sight:
and
the
king
held
out
to
Esther
the
golden
sceptre
that
was
in
his
hand.
So
Esther
drew
near,
and
touched
the
top
of
the
sceptre.
005:003
Then
said
the
king
unto
her,
What
wilt
thou,
queen
Esther?
and
what
is
thy
request?
it
shall
be
even
given
thee
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom.
005:004
And
Esther
answered,
If
it
seem
good
unto
the
king,
let
the
king
and
Haman
come
this
day
unto
the
banquet
that
I
have
prepared
for
him.
005:005
Then
the
king
said,
Cause
Haman
to
make
haste,
that
he
may
do
as
Esther
hath
said.
So
the
king
and
Haman
came
to
the
banquet
that
Esther
had
prepared.
005:006
And
the
king
said
unto
Esther
at
the
banquet
of
wine,
What
is
thy
petition?
and
it
shall
be
granted
thee:
and
what
is
thy
request?
even
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom
it
shall
be
performed.
005:007
Then
answered
Esther,
and
said,
My
petition
and
my
request
is;
005:008
If
I
have
found
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
king,
and
if
it
please
the
king
to
grant
my
petition,
and
to
perform
my
request,
let
the
king
and
Haman
come
to
the
banquet
that
I
shall
prepare
for
them,
and
I
will
do
to
morrow
as
the
king
hath
said.
005:009
Then
went
Haman
forth
that
day
joyful
and
with
a
glad
heart:
but
when
Haman
saw
Mordecai
in
the
king's
gate,
that
he
stood
not
up,
nor
moved
for
him,
he
was
full
of
indignation
against
Mordecai.
005:010
Nevertheless
Haman
refrained
himself:
and
when
he
came
home,
he
sent
and
called
for
his
friends,
and
Zeresh
his
wife.
005:011
And
Haman
told
them
of
the
glory
of
his
riches,
and
the
multitude
of
his
children,
and
all
the
things
wherein
the
king
had
promoted
him,
and
how
he
had
advanced
him
above
the
princes
and
servants
of
the
king.
005:012
Haman
said
moreover,
Yea,
Esther
the
queen
did
let
no
man
come
in
with
the
king
unto
the
banquet
that
she
had
prepared
but
myself;
and
to
morrow
am
I
invited
unto
her
also
with
the
king.
005:013
Yet
all
this
availeth
me
nothing,
so
long
as
I
see
Mordecai
the
Jew
sitting
at
the
king's
gate.
005:014
Then
said
Zeresh
his
wife
and
all
his
friends
unto
him,
Let
a
gallows
be
made
of
fifty
cubits
high,
and
to
morrow
speak
thou
unto
the
king
that
Mordecai
may
be
hanged
thereon:
then
go
thou
in
merrily
with
the
king
unto
the
banquet.
And
the
thing
pleased
Haman;
and
he
caused
the
gallows
to
be
made.
006:001
On
that
night
could
not
the
king
sleep,
and
he
commanded
to
bring
the
book
of
records
of
the
chronicles;
and
they
were
read
before
the
king.
006:002
And
it
was
found
written,
that
Mordecai
had
told
of
Bigthana
and
Teresh,
two
of
the
king's
chamberlains,
the
keepers
of
the
door,
who
sought
to
lay
hand
on
the
king
Ahasuerus.
006:003
And
the
king
said,
What
honour
and
dignity
hath
been
done
to
Mordecai
for
this?
Then
said
the
king's
servants
that
ministered
unto
him,
There
is
nothing
done
for
him.
006:004
And
the
king
said,
Who
is
in
the
court?
Now
Haman
was
come
into
the
outward
court
of
the
king's
house,
to
speak
unto
the
king
to
hang
Mordecai
on
the
gallows
that
he
had
prepared
for
him.
006:005
And
the
king's
servants
said
unto
him,
Behold,
Haman
standeth
in
the
court.
And
the
king
said,
Let
him
come
in.
006:006
So
Haman
came
in.
And
the
king
said
unto
him,
What
shall
be
done
unto
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour?
Now
Haman
thought
in
his
heart,
To
whom
would
the
king
delight
to
do
honour
more
than
to
myself?
006:007
And
Haman
answered
the
king,
For
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour,
006:008
Let
the
royal
apparel
be
brought
which
the
king
useth
to
wear,
and
the
horse
that
the
king
rideth
upon,
and
the
crown
royal
which
is
set
upon
his
head:
006:009
And
let
this
apparel
and
horse
be
delivered
to
the
hand
of
one
of
the
king's
most
noble
princes,
that
they
may
array
the
man
withal
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour,
and
bring
him
on
horseback
through
the
street
of
the
city,
and
proclaim
before
him,
Thus
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour.
006:010
Then
the
king
said
to
Haman,
Make
haste,
and
take
the
apparel
and
the
horse,
as
thou
hast
said,
and
do
even
so
to
Mordecai
the
Jew,
that
sitteth
at
the
king's
gate:
let
nothing
fail
of
all
that
thou
hast
spoken.
006:011
Then
took
Haman
the
apparel
and
the
horse,
and
arrayed
Mordecai,
and
brought
him
on
horseback
through
the
street
of
the
city,
and
proclaimed
before
him,
Thus
shall
it
be
done
unto
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour.
006:012
And
Mordecai
came
again
to
the
king's
gate.
But
Haman
hasted
to
his
house
mourning,
and
having
his
head
covered.
006:013
And
Haman
told
Zeresh
his
wife
and
all
his
friends
every
thing
that
had
befallen
him.
Then
said
his
wise
men
and
Zeresh
his
wife
unto
him,
If
Mordecai
be
of
the
seed
of
the
Jews,
before
whom
thou
hast
begun
to
fall,
thou
shalt
not
prevail
against
him,
but
shalt
surely
fall
before
him.
006:014
And
while
they
were
yet
talking
with
him,
came
the
king's
chamberlains,
and
hasted
to
bring
Haman
unto
the
banquet
that
Esther
had
prepared.
007:001
So
the
king
and
Haman
came
to
banquet
with
Esther
the
queen.
007:002
And
the
king
said
again
unto
Esther
on
the
second
day
at
the
banquet
of
wine,
What
is
thy
petition,
queen
Esther?
and
it
shall
be
granted
thee:
and
what
is
thy
request?
and
it
shall
be
performed,
even
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom.
007:003
Then
Esther
the
queen
answered
and
said,
If
I
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight,
O
king,
and
if
it
please
the
king,
let
my
life
be
given
me
at
my
petition,
and
my
people
at
my
request:
007:004
For
we
are
sold,
I
and
my
people,
to
be
destroyed,
to
be
slain,
and
to
perish.
But
if
we
had
been
sold
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen,
I
had
held
my
tongue,
although
the
enemy
could
not
countervail
the
king's
damage.
007:005
Then
the
king
Ahasuerus
answered
and
said
unto
Esther
the
queen,
Who
is
he,
and
where
is
he,
that
durst
presume
in
his
heart
to
do
so?
007:006
And
Esther
said,
The
adversary
and
enemy
is
this
wicked
Haman.
Then
Haman
was
afraid
before
the
king
and
the
queen.
007:007
And
the
king
arising
from
the
banquet
of
wine
in
his
wrath
went
into
the
palace
garden:
and
Haman
stood
up
to
make
request
for
his
life
to
Esther
the
queen;
for
he
saw
that
there
was
evil
determined
against
him
by
the
king.
007:008
Then
the
king
returned
out
of
the
palace
garden
into
the
place
of
the
banquet
of
wine;
and
Haman
was
fallen
upon
the
bed
whereon
Esther
was.
Then
said
the
king,
Will
he
force
the
queen
also
before
me
in
the
house?
As
the
word
went
out
of
king's
mouth,
they
covered
Haman's
face.
007:009
And
Harbonah,
one
of
the
chamberlains,
said
before
the
king,
Behold
also,
the
gallows
fifty
cubits
high,
which
Haman
had
made
for
Mordecai,
who
spoken
good
for
the
king,
standeth
in
the
house
of
Haman.
Then
the
king
said,
Hang
him
thereon.
007:010
So
they
hanged
Haman
on
the
gallows
that
he
had
prepared
for
Mordecai.
Then
was
the
king's
wrath
pacified.
008:001
On
that
day
did
the
king
Ahasuerus
give
the
house
of
Haman
the
Jews'
enemy
unto
Esther
the
queen.
And
Mordecai
came
before
the
king;
for
Esther
had
told
what
he
was
unto
her.
008:002
And
the
king
took
off
his
ring,
which
he
had
taken
from
Haman,
and
gave
it
unto
Mordecai.
And
Esther
set
Mordecai
over
the
house
of
Haman.
008:003
And
Esther
spake
yet
again
before
the
king,
and
fell
down
at
his
feet,
and
besought
him
with
tears
to
put
away
the
mischief
of
Haman
the
Agagite,
and
his
device
that
he
had
devised
against
the
Jews.
008:004
Then
the
king
held
out
the
golden
sceptre
toward
Esther.
So
Esther
arose,
and
stood
before
the
king,
008:005
And
said,
If
it
please
the
king,
and
if
I
have
favour
in
his
sight,
and
the
thing
seem
right
before
the
king,
and
I
be
pleasing
in
his
eyes,
let
it
be
written
to
reverse
the
letters
devised
by
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite,
which
he
wrote
to
destroy
the
Jews
which
are
in
all
the
king's
provinces:
008:006
For
how
can
I
endure
to
see
the
evil
that
shall
come
unto
my
people?
or
how
can
I
endure
to
see
the
destruction
of
my
kindred?
008:007
Then
the
king
Ahasuerus
said
unto
Esther
the
queen
and
to
Mordecai
the
Jew,
Behold,
I
have
given
Esther
the
house
of
Haman,
and
him
they
have
hanged
upon
the
gallows,
because
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
Jews.
008:008
Write
ye
also
for
the
Jews,
as
it
liketh
you,
in
the
king's
name,
and
seal
it
with
the
king's
ring:
for
the
writing
which
is
written
in
the
king's
name,
and
sealed
with
the
king's
ring,
may
no
man
reverse.
008:009
Then
were
the
king's
scribes
called
at
that
time
in
the
third
month,
that
is,
the
month
Sivan,
on
the
three
and
twentieth
day
thereof;
and
it
was
written
according
to
all
that
Mordecai
commanded
unto
the
Jews,
and
to
the
lieutenants,
and
the
deputies
and
rulers
of
the
provinces
which
are
from
India
unto
Ethiopia,
an
hundred
twenty
and
seven
provinces,
unto
every
province
according
to
the
writing
thereof,
and
unto
every
people
after
their
language,
and
to
the
Jews
according
to
their
writing,
and
according
to
their
language.
008:010
And
he
wrote
in
the
king
Ahasuerus'
name,
and
sealed
it
with
the
king's
ring,
and
sent
letters
by
posts
on
horseback,
and
riders
on
mules,
camels,
and
young
dromedaries:
008:011
Wherein
the
king
granted
the
Jews
which
were
in
every
city
to
gather
themselves
together,
and
to
stand
for
their
life,
to
destroy,
to
slay
and
to
cause
to
perish,
all
the
power
of
the
people
and
province
that
would
assault
them,
both
little
ones
and
women,
and
to
take
the
spoil
of
them
for
a
prey,
008:012
Upon
one
day
in
all
the
provinces
of
king
Ahasuerus,
namely,
upon
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
twelfth
month,
which
is
the
month
Adar.
008:013
The
copy
of
the
writing
for
a
commandment
to
be
given
in
every
province
was
published
unto
all
people,
and
that
the
Jews
should
be
ready
against
that
day
to
avenge
themselves
on
their
enemies.
008:014
So
the
posts
that
rode
upon
mules
and
camels
went
out,
being
hastened
and
pressed
on
by
the
king's
commandment.
And
the
decree
was
given
at
Shushan
the
palace.
008:015
And
Mordecai
went
out
from
the
presence
of
the
king
in
royal
apparel
of
blue
and
white,
and
with
a
great
crown
of
gold,
and
with
a
garment
of
fine
linen
and
purple:
and
the
city
of
Shushan
rejoiced
and
was
glad.
008:016
The
Jews
had
light,
and
gladness,
and
