joy,
and
honour.
008:017
And
in
every
province,
and
in
every
city,
whithersoever
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
came,
the
Jews
had
joy
and
gladness,
a
feast
and
a
good
day.
And
many
of
the
people
of
the
land
became
Jews;
for
the
fear
of
the
Jews
fell
upon
them.
009:001
Now
in
the
twelfth
month,
that
is,
the
month
Adar,
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
same,
when
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
drew
near
to
be
put
in
execution,
in
the
day
that
the
enemies
of
the
Jews
hoped
to
have
power
over
them,
(though
it
was
turned
to
the
contrary,
that
the
Jews
had
rule
over
them
that
hated
them;)
009:002
The
Jews
gathered
themselves
together
in
their
cities
throughout
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
Ahasuerus,
to
lay
hand
on
such
as
sought
their
hurt:
and
no
man
could
withstand
them;
for
the
fear
of
them
fell
upon
all
people.
009:003
And
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces,
and
the
lieutenants,
and
the
deputies,
and
officers
of
the
king,
helped
the
Jews;
because
the
fear
of
Mordecai
fell
upon
them.
009:004
For
Mordecai
was
great
in
the
king's
house,
and
his
fame
went
out
throughout
all
the
provinces:
for
this
man
Mordecai
waxed
greater
and
greater.
009:005
Thus
the
Jews
smote
all
their
enemies
with
the
stroke
of
the
sword,
and
slaughter,
and
destruction,
and
did
what
they
would
unto
those
that
hated
them.
009:006
And
in
Shushan
the
palace
the
Jews
slew
and
destroyed
five
hundred
men.
009:007
And
Parshandatha,
and
Dalphon,
and
Aspatha,
009:008
And
Poratha,
and
Adalia,
and
Aridatha,
009:009
And
Parmashta,
and
Arisai,
and
Aridai,
and
Vajezatha,
009:010
The
ten
sons
of
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha,
the
enemy
of
the
Jews,
slew
they;
but
on
the
spoil
laid
they
not
their
hand.
009:011
On
that
day
the
number
of
those
that
were
slain
in
Shushan
the
palace
was
brought
before
the
king.
009:012
And
the
king
said
unto
Esther
the
queen,
The
Jews
have
slain
and
destroyed
five
hundred
men
in
Shushan
the
palace,
and
the
ten
sons
of
Haman;
what
have
they
done
in
the
rest
of
the
king's
provinces?
now
what
is
thy
petition?
and
it
shall
be
granted
thee:
or
what
is
thy
request
further?
and
it
shall
be
done.
009:013
Then
said
Esther,
If
it
please
the
king,
let
it
be
granted
to
the
Jews
which
are
in
Shushan
to
do
to
morrow
also
according
unto
this
day's
decree,
and
let
Haman's
ten
sons
be
hanged
upon
the
gallows.
009:014
And
the
king
commanded
it
so
to
be
done:
and
the
decree
was
given
at
Shushan;
and
they
hanged
Haman's
ten
sons.
009:015
For
the
Jews
that
were
in
Shushan
gathered
themselves
together
on
the
fourteenth
day
also
of
the
month
Adar,
and
slew
three
hundred
men
at
Shushan;
but
on
the
prey
they
laid
not
their
hand.
009:016
But
the
other
Jews
that
were
in
the
king's
provinces
gathered
themselves
together,
and
stood
for
their
lives,
and
had
rest
from
their
enemies,
and
slew
of
their
foes
seventy
and
five
thousand,
but
they
laid
not
their
hands
on
the
prey,
009:017
On
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
month
Adar;
and
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
same
rested
they,
and
made
it
a
day
of
feasting
and
gladness.
009:018
But
the
Jews
that
were
at
Shushan
assembled
together
on
the
thirteenth
day
thereof,
and
on
the
fourteenth
thereof;
and
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
same
they
rested,
and
made
it
a
day
of
feasting
and
gladness.
009:019
Therefore
the
Jews
of
the
villages,
that
dwelt
in
the
unwalled
towns,
made
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
Adar
a
day
of
gladness
and
feasting,
and
a
good
day,
and
of
sending
portions
one
to
another.
009:020
And
Mordecai
wrote
these
things,
and
sent
letters
unto
all
the
Jews
that
were
in
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
Ahasuerus,
both
nigh
and
far,
009:021
To
stablish
this
among
them,
that
they
should
keep
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
Adar,
and
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
same,
yearly,
009:022
As
the
days
wherein
the
Jews
rested
from
their
enemies,
and
the
month
which
was
turned
unto
them
from
sorrow
to
joy,
and
from
mourning
into
a
good
day:
that
they
should
make
them
days
of
feasting
and
joy,
and
of
sending
portions
one
to
another,
and
gifts
to
the
poor.
009:023
And
the
Jews
undertook
to
do
as
they
had
begun,
and
as
Mordecai
had
written
unto
them;
009:024
Because
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha,
the
Agagite,
the
enemy
of
all
the
Jews,
had
devised
against
the
Jews
to
destroy
them,
and
had
cast
Pur,
that
is,
the
lot,
to
consume
them,
and
to
destroy
them;
009:025
But
when
Esther
came
before
the
king,
he
commanded
by
letters
that
his
wicked
device,
which
he
devised
against
the
Jews,
should
return
upon
his
own
head,
and
that
he
and
his
sons
should
be
hanged
on
the
gallows.
009:026
Wherefore
they
called
these
days
Purim
after
the
name
of
Pur.
Therefore
for
all
the
words
of
this
letter,
and
of
that
which
they
had
seen
concerning
this
matter,
and
which
had
come
unto
them,
009:027
The
Jews
ordained,
and
took
upon
them,
and
upon
their
seed,
and
upon
all
such
as
joined
themselves
unto
them,
so
as
it
should
not
fail,
that
they
would
keep
these
two
days
according
to
their
writing,
and
according
to
their
appointed
time
every
year;
009:028
And
that
these
days
should
be
remembered
and
kept
throughout
every
generation,
every
family,
every
province,
and
every
city;
and
that
these
days
of
Purim
should
not
fail
from
among
the
Jews,
nor
the
memorial
of
them
perish
from
their
seed.
009:029
Then
Esther
the
queen,
the
daughter
of
Abihail,
and
Mordecai
the
Jew,
wrote
with
all
authority,
to
confirm
this
second
letter
of
Purim.
009:030
And
he
sent
the
letters
unto
all
the
Jews,
to
the
hundred
twenty
and
seven
provinces
of
the
kingdom
of
Ahasuerus,
with
words
of
peace
and
truth,
009:031
To
confirm
these
days
of
Purim
in
their
times
appointed,
according
as
Mordecai
the
Jew
and
Esther
the
queen
had
enjoined
them,
and
as
they
had
decreed
for
themselves
and
for
their
seed,
the
matters
of
the
fastings
and
their
cry.
009:032
And
the
decree
of
Esther
confirmed
these
matters
of
Purim;
and
it
was
written
in
the
book.
010:001
And
the
king
Ahasuerus
laid
a
tribute
upon
the
land,
and
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea.
010:002
And
all
the
acts
of
his
power
and
of
his
might,
and
the
declaration
of
the
greatness
of
Mordecai,
whereunto
the
king
advanced
him,
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
Media
and
Persia?
010:003
For
Mordecai
the
Jew
was
next
unto
king
Ahasuerus,
and
great
among
the
Jews,
and
accepted
of
the
multitude
of
his
brethren,
seeking
the
wealth
of
his
people,
and
speaking
peace
to
all
his
seed.
Book
18	Job
001:001
There
was
a
man
in
the
land
of
Uz,
whose
name
was
Job;
and
that
man
was
perfect
and
upright,
and
one
that
feared
God,
and
eschewed
evil.
001:002
And
there
were
born
unto
him
seven
sons
and
three
daughters.
001:003
His
substance
also
was
seven
thousand
sheep,
and
three
thousand
camels,
and
five
hundred
yoke
of
oxen,
and
five
hundred
she
asses,
and
a
very
great
household;
so
that
this
man
was
the
greatest
of
all
the
men
of
the
east.
001:004
And
his
sons
went
and
feasted
in
their
houses,
every
one
his
day;
and
sent
and
called
for
their
three
sisters
to
eat
and
to
drink
with
them.
001:005
And
it
was
so,
when
the
days
of
their
feasting
were
gone
about,
that
Job
sent
and
sanctified
them,
and
rose
up
early
in
the
morning,
and
offered
burnt
offerings
according
to
the
number
of
them
all:
for
Job
said,
It
may
be
that
my
sons
have
sinned,
and
cursed
God
in
their
hearts.
Thus
did
Job
continually.
001:006
Now
there
was
a
day
when
the
sons
of
God
came
to
present
themselves
before
the
LORD,
and
Satan
came
also
among
them.
001:007
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Satan,
Whence
comest
thou?
Then
Satan
answered
the
LORD,
and
said,
From
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth,
and
from
walking
up
and
down
in
it.
001:008
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Satan,
Hast
thou
considered
my
servant
Job,
that
there
is
none
like
him
in
the
earth,
a
perfect
and
an
upright
man,
one
that
feareth
God,
and
escheweth
evil?
001:009
Then
Satan
answered
the
LORD,
and
said,
Doth
Job
fear
God
for
nought?
001:010
Hast
not
thou
made
an
hedge
about
him,
and
about
his
house,
and
about
all
that
he
hath
on
every
side?
thou
hast
blessed
the
work
of
his
hands,
and
his
substance
is
increased
in
the
land.
001:011
But
put
forth
thine
hand
now,
and
touch
all
that
he
hath,
and
he
will
curse
thee
to
thy
face.
001:012
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Satan,
Behold,
all
that
he
hath
is
in
thy
power;
only
upon
himself
put
not
forth
thine
hand.
So
Satan
went
forth
from
the
presence
of
the
LORD.
001:013
And
there
was
a
day
when
his
sons
and
his
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
eldest
brother's
house:
001:014
And
there
came
a
messenger
unto
Job,
and
said,
The
oxen
were
plowing,
and
the
asses
feeding
beside
them:
001:015
And
the
Sabeans
fell
upon
them,
and
took
them
away;
yea,
they
have
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
of
the
sword;
and
I
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee.
001:016
While
he
was
yet
speaking,
there
came
also
another,
and
said,
The
fire
of
God
is
fallen
from
heaven,
and
hath
burned
up
the
sheep,
and
the
servants,
and
consumed
them;
and
I
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee.
001:017
While
he
was
yet
speaking,
there
came
also
another,
and
said,
The
Chaldeans
made
out
three
bands,
and
fell
upon
the
camels,
and
have
carried
them
away,
yea,
and
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
of
the
sword;
and
I
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee.
001:018
While
he
was
yet
speaking,
there
came
also
another,
and
said,
Thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
eldest
brother's
house:
001:019
And,
behold,
there
came
a
great
wind
from
the
wilderness,
and
smote
the
four
corners
of
the
house,
and
it
fell
upon
the
young
men,
and
they
are
dead;
and
I
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee.
001:020
Then
Job
arose,
and
rent
his
mantle,
and
shaved
his
head,
and
fell
down
upon
the
ground,
and
worshipped,
001:021
And
said,
Naked
came
I
out
of
my
mother's
womb,
and
naked
shall
I
return
thither:
the
LORD
gave,
and
the
LORD
hath
taken
away;
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
LORD.
001:022
In
all
this
Job
sinned
not,
nor
charged
God
foolishly.
002:001
Again
there
was
a
day
when
the
sons
of
God
came
to
present
themselves
before
the
LORD,
and
Satan
came
also
among
them
to
present
himself
before
the
LORD.
002:002
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Satan,
From
whence
comest
thou?
And
Satan
answered
the
LORD,
and
said,
From
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth,
and
from
walking
up
and
down
in
it.
002:003
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Satan,
Hast
thou
considered
my
servant
Job,
that
there
is
none
like
him
in
the
earth,
a
perfect
and
an
upright
man,
one
that
feareth
God,
and
escheweth
evil?
and
still
he
holdeth
fast
his
integrity,
although
thou
movedst
me
against
him,
to
destroy
him
without
cause.
002:004
And
Satan
answered
the
LORD,
and
said,
Skin
for
skin,
yea,
all
that
a
man
hath
will
he
give
for
his
life.
002:005
But
put
forth
thine
hand
now,
and
touch
his
bone
and
his
flesh,
and
he
will
curse
thee
to
thy
face.
002:006
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Satan,
Behold,
he
is
in
thine
hand;
but
save
his
life.
002:007
So
went
Satan
forth
from
the
presence
of
the
LORD,
and
smote
Job
with
sore
boils
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
unto
his
crown.
002:008
And
he
took
him
a
potsherd
to
scrape
himself
withal;
and
he
sat
down
among
the
ashes.
002:009
Then
said
his
wife
unto
him,
Dost
thou
still
retain
thine
integrity?
curse
God,
and
die.
002:010
But
he
said
unto
her,
Thou
speakest
as
one
of
the
foolish
women
speaketh.
What?
shall
we
receive
good
at
the
hand
of
God,
and
shall
we
not
receive
evil?
In
all
this
did
not
Job
sin
with
his
lips.
002:011
Now
when
Job's
three
friends
heard
of
all
this
evil
that
was
come
upon
him,
they
came
every
one
from
his
own
place;
Eliphaz
the
Temanite,
and
Bildad
the
Shuhite,
and
Zophar
the
Naamathite:
for
they
had
made
an
appointment
together
to
come
to
mourn
with
him
and
to
comfort
him.
002:012
And
when
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
afar
off,
and
knew
him
not,
they
lifted
up
their
voice,
and
wept;
and
they
rent
every
one
his
mantle,
and
sprinkled
dust
upon
their
heads
toward
heaven.
002:013
So
they
sat
down
with
him
upon
the
ground
seven
days
and
seven
nights,
and
none
spake
a
word
unto
him:
for
they
saw
that
his
grief
was
very
great.
003:001
After
this
opened
Job
his
mouth,
and
cursed
his
day.
003:002
And
Job
spake,
and
said,
003:003
Let
the
day
perish
wherein
I
was
born,
and
the
night
in
which
it
was
said,
There
is
a
man
child
conceived.
003:004
Let
that
day
be
darkness;
let
not
God
regard
it
from
above,
neither
let
the
light
shine
upon
it.
003:005
Let
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
stain
it;
let
a
cloud
dwell
upon
it;
let
the
blackness
of
the
day
terrify
it.
003:006
As
for
that
night,
let
darkness
seize
upon
it;
let
it
not
be
joined
unto
the
days
of
the
year,
let
it
not
come
into
the
number
of
the
months.
003:007
Lo,
let
that
night
be
solitary,
let
no
joyful
voice
come
therein.
003:008
Let
them
curse
it
that
curse
the
day,
who
are
ready
to
raise
up
their
mourning.
003:009
Let
the
stars
of
the
twilight
thereof
be
dark;
let
it
look
for
light,
but
have
none;
neither
let
it
see
the
dawning
of
the
day:
003:010
Because
it
shut
not
up
the
doors
of
my
mother's
womb,
nor
hid
sorrow
from
mine
eyes.
003:011
Why
died
I
not
from
the
womb?
why
did
I
not
give
up
the
ghost
when
I
came
out
of
the
belly?
003:012
Why
did
the
knees
prevent
me?
or
why
the
breasts
that
I
should
suck?
003:013
For
now
should
I
have
lain
still
and
been
quiet,
I
should
have
slept:
then
had
I
been
at
rest,
003:014
With
kings
and
counsellors
of
the
earth,
which
build
desolate
places
for
themselves;
003:015
Or
with
princes
that
had
gold,
who
filled
their
houses
with
silver:
003:016
Or
as
an
hidden
untimely
birth
I
had
not
been;
as
infants
which
never
saw
light.
003:017
There
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling;
and
there
the
weary
be
at
rest.
003:018
There
the
prisoners
rest
together;
they
hear
not
the
voice
of
the
oppressor.
003:019
The
small
and
great
are
there;
and
the
servant
is
free
from
his
master.
003:020
Wherefore
is
light
given
to
him
that
is
in
misery,
and
life
unto
the
bitter
in
soul;
003:021
Which
long
for
death,
but
it
cometh
not;
and
dig
for
it
more
than
for
hid
treasures;
003:022
Which
rejoice
exceedingly,
and
are
glad,
when
they
can
find
the
grave?
003:023
Why
is
light
given
to
a
man
whose
way
is
hid,
and
whom
God
hath
hedged
in?
003:024
For
my
sighing
cometh
before
I
eat,
and
my
roarings
are
poured
out
like
the
waters.
003:025
For
the
thing
which
I
greatly
feared
is
come
upon
me,
and
that
which
I
was
afraid
of
is
come
unto
me.
003:026
I
was
not
in
safety,
neither
had
I
rest,
neither
was
I
quiet;
yet
trouble
came.
004:001
Then
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
answered
and
said,
004:002
If
we
assay
to
commune
with
thee,
wilt
thou
be
grieved?
but
who
can
withhold
himself
from
speaking?
004:003
Behold,
thou
hast
instructed
many,
and
thou
hast
strengthened
the
weak
hands.
004:004
Thy
words
have
upholden
him
that
was
falling,
and
thou
hast
strengthened
the
feeble
knees.
004:005
But
now
it
is
come
upon
thee,
and
thou
faintest;
it
toucheth
thee,
and
thou
art
troubled.
004:006
Is
not
this
thy
fear,
thy
confidence,
thy
hope,
and
the
uprightness
of
thy
ways?
004:007
Remember,
I
pray
thee,
who
ever
perished,
being
innocent?
or
where
were
the
righteous
cut
off?
004:008
Even
as
I
have
seen,
they
that
plow
iniquity,
and
sow
wickedness,
reap
the
same.
004:009
By
the
blast
of
God
they
perish,
and
by
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
are
they
consumed.
004:010
The
roaring
of
the
lion,
and
the
voice
of
the
fierce
lion,
and
the
teeth
of
the
young
lions,
are
broken.
004:011
The
old
lion
perisheth
for
lack
of
prey,
and
the
stout
lion's
whelps
are
scattered
abroad.
004:012
Now
a
thing
was
secretly
brought
to
me,
and
mine
ear
received
a
little
thereof.
004:013
In
thoughts
from
the
visions
of
the
night,
when
deep
sleep
falleth
on
men,
004:014
Fear
came
upon
me,
and
trembling,
which
made
all
my
bones
to
shake.
004:015
Then
a
spirit
passed
before
my
face;
the
hair
of
my
flesh
stood
up:
004:016
It
stood
still,
but
I
could
not
discern
the
form
thereof:
an
image
was
before
mine
eyes,
there
was
silence,
and
I
heard
a
voice,
saying,
004:017
Shall
mortal
man
be
more
just
than
God?
shall
a
man
be
more
pure
than
his
maker?
004:018
Behold,
he
put
no
trust
in
his
servants;
and
his
angels
he
charged
with
folly:
004:019
How
much
less
in
them
that
dwell
in
houses
of
clay,
whose
foundation
is
in
the
dust,
which
are
crushed
before
the
moth?
004:020
They
are
destroyed
from
morning
to
evening:
they
perish
for
ever
without
any
regarding
it.
004:021
Doth
not
their
excellency
which
is
in
them
go
away?
they
die,
even
without
wisdom.
005:001
Call
now,
if
there
be
any
that
will
answer
thee;
and
to
which
of
the
saints
wilt
thou
turn?
005:002
For
wrath
killeth
the
foolish
man,
and
envy
slayeth
the
silly
one.
005:003
I
have
seen
the
foolish
taking
root:
but
suddenly
I
cursed
his
habitation.
005:004
His
children
are
far
from
safety,
and
they
are
crushed
in
the
gate,
neither
is
there
any
to
deliver
them.
005:005
Whose
harvest
the
hungry
eateth
up,
and
taketh
it
even
out
of
the
thorns,
and
the
robber
swalloweth
up
their
substance.
005:006
Although
affliction
cometh
not
forth
of
the
dust,
neither
doth
trouble
spring
out
of
the
ground;
005:007
Yet
man
is
born
unto
trouble,
as
the
sparks
fly
upward.
005:008
I
would
seek
unto
God,
and
unto
God
would
I
commit
my
cause:
005:009
Which
doeth
great
things
and
unsearchable;
marvellous
things
without
number:
005:010
Who
giveth
rain
upon
the
earth,
and
sendeth
waters
upon
the
fields:
005:011
To
set
up
on
high
those
that
be
low;
that
those
which
mourn
may
be
exalted
to
safety.
005:012
He
disappointeth
the
devices
of
the
crafty,
so
that
their
hands
cannot
perform
their
enterprise.
005:013
He
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness:
and
the
counsel
of
the
froward
is
carried
headlong.
005:014
They
meet
with
darkness
in
the
day
time,
and
grope
in
the
noonday
as
in
the
night.
005:015
But
he
saveth
the
poor
from
the
sword,
from
their
mouth,
and
from
the
hand
of
the
mighty.
005:016
So
the
poor
hath
hope,
and
iniquity
stoppeth
her
mouth.
005:017
Behold,
happy
is
the
man
whom
God
correcteth:
therefore
despise
not
thou
the
chastening
of
the
Almighty:
005:018
For
he
maketh
sore,
and
bindeth
up:
he
woundeth,
and
his
hands
make
whole.
005:019
He
shall
deliver
thee
in
six
troubles:
yea,
in
seven
there
shall
no
evil
touch
thee.
005:020
In
famine
he
shall
redeem
thee
from
death:
and
in
war
from
the
power
of
the
sword.
005:021
Thou
shalt
be
hid
from
the
scourge
of
the
tongue:
neither
shalt
thou
be
afraid
of
destruction
when
it
cometh.
005:022
At
destruction
and
famine
thou
shalt
laugh:
neither
shalt
thou
be
afraid
of
the
beasts
of
the
earth.
005:023
For
thou
shalt
be
in
league
with
the
stones
of
the
field:
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
be
at
peace
with
thee.
005:024
And
thou
shalt
know
that
thy
tabernacle
shall
be
in
peace;
and
thou
shalt
visit
thy
habitation,
and
shalt
not
sin.
005:025
Thou
shalt
know
also
that
thy
seed
shall
be
great,
and
thine
offspring
as
the
grass
of
the
earth.
005:026
Thou
shalt
come
to
thy
grave
in
a
full
age,
like
as
a
shock
of
corn
cometh
in
in
his
season.
005:027
Lo
this,
we
have
searched
it,
so
it
is;
hear
it,
and
know
thou
it
for
thy
good.
006:001
But
Job
answered
and
said,
006:002
Oh
that
my
grief
were
throughly
weighed,
and
my
calamity
laid
in
the
balances
together!
006:003
For
now
it
would
be
heavier
than
the
sand
of
the
sea:
therefore
my
words
are
swallowed
up.
006:004
For
the
arrows
of
the
Almighty
are
within
me,
the
poison
whereof
drinketh
up
my
spirit:
the
terrors
of
God
do
set
themselves
in
array
against
me.
006:005
Doth
the
wild
ass
bray
when
he
hath
grass?
or
loweth
the
ox
over
his
fodder?
006:006
Can
that
which
is
unsavoury
be
eaten
without
salt?
or
is
there
any
taste
in
the
white
of
an
egg?
006:007
The
things
that
my
soul
refused
to
touch
are
as
my
sorrowful
meat.
006:008
Oh
that
I
might
have
my
request;
and
that
God
would
grant
me
the
thing
that
I
long
for!
006:009
Even
that
it
would
please
God
to
destroy
me;
that
he
would
let
loose
his
hand,
and
cut
me
off!
006:010
Then
should
I
yet
have
comfort;
yea,
I
would
harden
myself
in
sorrow:
let
him
not
spare;
for
I
have
not
concealed
the
words
of
the
Holy
One.
006:011
What
is
my
strength,
that
I
should
hope?
and
what
is
mine
end,
that
I
should
prolong
my
life?
006:012
Is
my
strength
the
strength
of
stones?
or
is
my
flesh
of
brass?
006:013
Is
not
my
help
in
me?
and
is
wisdom
driven
quite
from
me?
006:014
To
him
that
is
afflicted
pity
should
be
shewed
from
his
friend;
but
he
forsaketh
the
fear
of
the
Almighty.
006:015
My
brethren
have
dealt
deceitfully
as
a
brook,
and
as
the
stream
of
brooks
they
pass
away;
006:016
Which
are
blackish
by
reason
of
the
ice,
and
wherein
the
snow
is
hid:
006:017
What
time
they
wax
warm,
they
vanish:
when
it
is
hot,
they
are
consumed
out
of
their
place.
006:018
The
paths
of
their
way
are
turned
aside;
they
go
to
nothing,
and
perish.
006:019
The
troops
of
Tema
looked,
the
companies
of
Sheba
waited
for
them.
006:020
They
were
confounded
because
they
had
hoped;
they
came
thither,
and
were
ashamed.
006:021
For
now
ye
are
nothing;
ye
see
my
casting
down,
and
are
afraid.
006:022
Did
I
say,
Bring
unto
me?
or,
Give
a
reward
for
me
of
your
substance?
006:023
Or,
Deliver
me
from
the
enemy's
hand?
or,
Redeem
me
from
the
hand
of
the
mighty?
006:024
Teach
me,
and
I
will
hold
my
tongue:
and
cause
me
to
understand
wherein
I
have
erred.
006:025
How
forcible
are
right
words!
but
what
doth
your
arguing
reprove?
006:026
Do
ye
imagine
to
reprove
words,
and
the
speeches
of
one
that
is
desperate,
which
are
as
wind?
006:027
Yea,
ye
overwhelm
the
fatherless,
and
ye
dig
a
pit
for
your
friend.
006:028
Now
therefore
be
content,
look
upon
me;
for
it
is
evident
unto
you
if
I
lie.
006:029
Return,
I
pray
you,
let
it
not
be
iniquity;
yea,
return
again,
my
righteousness
is
in
it.
006:030
Is
there
iniquity
in
my
tongue?
cannot
my
taste
discern
perverse
things?
007:001
Is
there
not
an
appointed
time
to
man
upon
earth?
are
not
his
days
also
like
the
days
of
an
hireling?
007:002
As
a
servant
earnestly
desireth
the
shadow,
and
as
an
hireling
looketh
for
the
reward
of
his
work:
007:003
So
am
I
made
to
possess
months
of
vanity,
and
wearisome
nights
are
appointed
to
me.
007:004
When
I
lie
down,
I
say,
