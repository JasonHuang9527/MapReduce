When
shall
I
arise,
and
the
night
be
gone?
and
I
am
full
of
tossings
to
and
fro
unto
the
dawning
of
the
day.
007:005
My
flesh
is
clothed
with
worms
and
clods
of
dust;
my
skin
is
broken,
and
become
loathsome.
007:006
My
days
are
swifter
than
a
weaver's
shuttle,
and
are
spent
without
hope.
007:007
O
remember
that
my
life
is
wind:
mine
eye
shall
no
more
see
good.
007:008
The
eye
of
him
that
hath
seen
me
shall
see
me
no
more:
thine
eyes
are
upon
me,
and
I
am
not.
007:009
As
the
cloud
is
consumed
and
vanisheth
away:
so
he
that
goeth
down
to
the
grave
shall
come
up
no
more.
007:010
He
shall
return
no
more
to
his
house,
neither
shall
his
place
know
him
any
more.
007:011
Therefore
I
will
not
refrain
my
mouth;
I
will
speak
in
the
anguish
of
my
spirit;
I
will
complain
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul.
007:012
Am
I
a
sea,
or
a
whale,
that
thou
settest
a
watch
over
me?
007:013
When
I
say,
My
bed
shall
comfort
me,
my
couch
shall
ease
my
complaints;
007:014
Then
thou
scarest
me
with
dreams,
and
terrifiest
me
through
visions:
007:015
So
that
my
soul
chooseth
strangling,
and
death
rather
than
my
life.
007:016
I
loathe
it;
I
would
not
live
alway:
let
me
alone;
for
my
days
are
vanity.
007:017
What
is
man,
that
thou
shouldest
magnify
him?
and
that
thou
shouldest
set
thine
heart
upon
him?
007:018
And
that
thou
shouldest
visit
him
every
morning,
and
try
him
every
moment?
007:019
How
long
wilt
thou
not
depart
from
me,
nor
let
me
alone
till
I
swallow
down
my
spittle?
007:020
I
have
sinned;
what
shall
I
do
unto
thee,
O
thou
preserver
of
men?
why
hast
thou
set
me
as
a
mark
against
thee,
so
that
I
am
a
burden
to
myself?
007:021
And
why
dost
thou
not
pardon
my
transgression,
and
take
away
my
iniquity?
for
now
shall
I
sleep
in
the
dust;
and
thou
shalt
seek
me
in
the
morning,
but
I
shall
not
be.
008:001
Then
answered
Bildad
the
Shuhite,
and
said,
008:002
How
long
wilt
thou
speak
these
things?
and
how
long
shall
the
words
of
thy
mouth
be
like
a
strong
wind?
008:003
Doth
God
pervert
judgment?
or
doth
the
Almighty
pervert
justice?
008:004
If
thy
children
have
sinned
against
him,
and
he
have
cast
them
away
for
their
transgression;
008:005
If
thou
wouldest
seek
unto
God
betimes,
and
make
thy
supplication
to
the
Almighty;
008:006
If
thou
wert
pure
and
upright;
surely
now
he
would
awake
for
thee,
and
make
the
habitation
of
thy
righteousness
prosperous.
008:007
Though
thy
beginning
was
small,
yet
thy
latter
end
should
greatly
increase.
008:008
For
enquire,
I
pray
thee,
of
the
former
age,
and
prepare
thyself
to
the
search
of
their
fathers:
008:009
(For
we
are
but
of
yesterday,
and
know
nothing,
because
our
days
upon
earth
are
a
shadow:)
008:010
Shall
not
they
teach
thee,
and
tell
thee,
and
utter
words
out
of
their
heart?
008:011
Can
the
rush
grow
up
without
mire?
can
the
flag
grow
without
water?
008:012
Whilst
it
is
yet
in
his
greenness,
and
not
cut
down,
it
withereth
before
any
other
herb.
008:013
So
are
the
paths
of
all
that
forget
God;
and
the
hypocrite's
hope
shall
perish:
008:014
Whose
hope
shall
be
cut
off,
and
whose
trust
shall
be
a
spider's
web.
008:015
He
shall
lean
upon
his
house,
but
it
shall
not
stand:
he
shall
hold
it
fast,
but
it
shall
not
endure.
008:016
He
is
green
before
the
sun,
and
his
branch
shooteth
forth
in
his
garden.
008:017
His
roots
are
wrapped
about
the
heap,
and
seeth
the
place
of
stones.
008:018
If
he
destroy
him
from
his
place,
then
it
shall
deny
him,
saying,
I
have
not
seen
thee.
008:019
Behold,
this
is
the
joy
of
his
way,
and
out
of
the
earth
shall
others
grow.
008:020
Behold,
God
will
not
cast
away
a
perfect
man,
neither
will
he
help
the
evil
doers:
008:021
Till
he
fill
thy
mouth
with
laughing,
and
thy
lips
with
rejoicing.
008:022
They
that
hate
thee
shall
be
clothed
with
shame;
and
the
dwelling
place
of
the
wicked
shall
come
to
nought.
009:001
Then
Job
answered
and
said,
009:002
I
know
it
is
so
of
a
truth:
but
how
should
man
be
just
with
God?
009:003
If
he
will
contend
with
him,
he
cannot
answer
him
one
of
a
thousand.
009:004
He
is
wise
in
heart,
and
mighty
in
strength:
who
hath
hardened
himself
against
him,
and
hath
prospered?
009:005
Which
removeth
the
mountains,
and
they
know
not:
which
overturneth
them
in
his
anger.
009:006
Which
shaketh
the
earth
out
of
her
place,
and
the
pillars
thereof
tremble.
009:007
Which
commandeth
the
sun,
and
it
riseth
not;
and
sealeth
up
the
stars.
009:008
Which
alone
spreadeth
out
the
heavens,
and
treadeth
upon
the
waves
of
the
sea.
009:009
Which
maketh
Arcturus,
Orion,
and
Pleiades,
and
the
chambers
of
the
south.
009:010
Which
doeth
great
things
past
finding
out;
yea,
and
wonders
without
number.
009:011
Lo,
he
goeth
by
me,
and
I
see
him
not:
he
passeth
on
also,
but
I
perceive
him
not.
009:012
Behold,
he
taketh
away,
who
can
hinder
him?
who
will
say
unto
him,
What
doest
thou?
009:013
If
God
will
not
withdraw
his
anger,
the
proud
helpers
do
stoop
under
him.
009:014
How
much
less
shall
I
answer
him,
and
choose
out
my
words
to
reason
with
him?
009:015
Whom,
though
I
were
righteous,
yet
would
I
not
answer,
but
I
would
make
supplication
to
my
judge.
009:016
If
I
had
called,
and
he
had
answered
me;
yet
would
I
not
believe
that
he
had
hearkened
unto
my
voice.
009:017
For
he
breaketh
me
with
a
tempest,
and
multiplieth
my
wounds
without
cause.
009:018
He
will
not
suffer
me
to
take
my
breath,
but
filleth
me
with
bitterness.
009:019
If
I
speak
of
strength,
lo,
he
is
strong:
and
if
of
judgment,
who
shall
set
me
a
time
to
plead?
009:020
If
I
justify
myself,
mine
own
mouth
shall
condemn
me:
if
I
say,
I
am
perfect,
it
shall
also
prove
me
perverse.
009:021
Though
I
were
perfect,
yet
would
I
not
know
my
soul:
I
would
despise
my
life.
009:022
This
is
one
thing,
therefore
I
said
it,
He
destroyeth
the
perfect
and
the
wicked.
009:023
If
the
scourge
slay
suddenly,
he
will
laugh
at
the
trial
of
the
innocent.
009:024
The
earth
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
wicked:
he
covereth
the
faces
of
the
judges
thereof;
if
not,
where,
and
who
is
he?
009:025
Now
my
days
are
swifter
than
a
post:
they
flee
away,
they
see
no
good.
009:026
They
are
passed
away
as
the
swift
ships:
as
the
eagle
that
hasteth
to
the
prey.
009:027
If
I
say,
I
will
forget
my
complaint,
I
will
leave
off
my
heaviness,
and
comfort
myself:
009:028
I
am
afraid
of
all
my
sorrows,
I
know
that
thou
wilt
not
hold
me
innocent.
009:029
If
I
be
wicked,
why
then
labour
I
in
vain?
009:030
If
I
wash
myself
with
snow
water,
and
make
my
hands
never
so
clean;
009:031
Yet
shalt
thou
plunge
me
in
the
ditch,
and
mine
own
clothes
shall
abhor
me.
009:032
For
he
is
not
a
man,
as
I
am,
that
I
should
answer
him,
and
we
should
come
together
in
judgment.
009:033
Neither
is
there
any
daysman
betwixt
us,
that
might
lay
his
hand
upon
us
both.
009:034
Let
him
take
his
rod
away
from
me,
and
let
not
his
fear
terrify
me:
009:035
Then
would
I
speak,
and
not
fear
him;
but
it
is
not
so
with
me.
010:001
My
soul
is
weary
of
my
life;
I
will
leave
my
complaint
upon
myself;
I
will
speak
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul.
010:002
I
will
say
unto
God,
Do
not
condemn
me;
shew
me
wherefore
thou
contendest
with
me.
010:003
Is
it
good
unto
thee
that
thou
shouldest
oppress,
that
thou
shouldest
despise
the
work
of
thine
hands,
and
shine
upon
the
counsel
of
the
wicked?
010:004
Hast
thou
eyes
of
flesh?
or
seest
thou
as
man
seeth?
010:005
Are
thy
days
as
the
days
of
man?
are
thy
years
as
man's
days,
010:006
That
thou
enquirest
after
mine
iniquity,
and
searchest
after
my
sin?
010:007
Thou
knowest
that
I
am
not
wicked;
and
there
is
none
that
can
deliver
out
of
thine
hand.
010:008
Thine
hands
have
made
me
and
fashioned
me
together
round
about;
yet
thou
dost
destroy
me.
010:009
Remember,
I
beseech
thee,
that
thou
hast
made
me
as
the
clay;
and
wilt
thou
bring
me
into
dust
again?
010:010
Hast
thou
not
poured
me
out
as
milk,
and
curdled
me
like
cheese?
010:011
Thou
hast
clothed
me
with
skin
and
flesh,
and
hast
fenced
me
with
bones
and
sinews.
010:012
Thou
hast
granted
me
life
and
favour,
and
thy
visitation
hath
preserved
my
spirit.
010:013
And
these
things
hast
thou
hid
in
thine
heart:
I
know
that
this
is
with
thee.
010:014
If
I
sin,
then
thou
markest
me,
and
thou
wilt
not
acquit
me
from
mine
iniquity.
010:015
If
I
be
wicked,
woe
unto
me;
and
if
I
be
righteous,
yet
will
I
not
lift
up
my
head.
I
am
full
of
confusion;
therefore
see
thou
mine
affliction;
010:016
For
it
increaseth.
Thou
huntest
me
as
a
fierce
lion:
and
again
thou
shewest
thyself
marvellous
upon
me.
010:017
Thou
renewest
thy
witnesses
against
me,
and
increasest
thine
indignation
upon
me;
changes
and
war
are
against
me.
010:018
Wherefore
then
hast
thou
brought
me
forth
out
of
the
womb?
Oh
that
I
had
given
up
the
ghost,
and
no
eye
had
seen
me!
010:019
I
should
have
been
as
though
I
had
not
been;
I
should
have
been
carried
from
the
womb
to
the
grave.
010:020
Are
not
my
days
few?
cease
then,
and
let
me
alone,
that
I
may
take
comfort
a
little,
010:021
Before
I
go
whence
I
shall
not
return,
even
to
the
land
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death;
010:022
A
land
of
darkness,
as
darkness
itself;
and
of
the
shadow
of
death,
without
any
order,
and
where
the
light
is
as
darkness.
011:001
Then
answered
Zophar
the
Naamathite,
and
said,
011:002
Should
not
the
multitude
of
words
be
answered?
and
should
a
man
full
of
talk
be
justified?
011:003
Should
thy
lies
make
men
hold
their
peace?
and
when
thou
mockest,
shall
no
man
make
thee
ashamed?
011:004
For
thou
hast
said,
My
doctrine
is
pure,
and
I
am
clean
in
thine
eyes.
011:005
But
oh
that
God
would
speak,
and
open
his
lips
against
thee;
011:006
And
that
he
would
shew
thee
the
secrets
of
wisdom,
that
they
are
double
to
that
which
is!
Know
therefore
that
God
exacteth
of
thee
less
than
thine
iniquity
deserveth.
011:007
Canst
thou
by
searching
find
out
God?
canst
thou
find
out
the
Almighty
unto
perfection?
011:008
It
is
as
high
as
heaven;
what
canst
thou
do?
deeper
than
hell;
what
canst
thou
know?
011:009
The
measure
thereof
is
longer
than
the
earth,
and
broader
than
the
sea.
011:010
If
he
cut
off,
and
shut
up,
or
gather
together,
then
who
can
hinder
him?
011:011
For
he
knoweth
vain
men:
he
seeth
wickedness
also;
will
he
not
then
consider
it?
011:012
For
vain
men
would
be
wise,
though
man
be
born
like
a
wild
ass's
colt.
011:013
If
thou
prepare
thine
heart,
and
stretch
out
thine
hands
toward
him;
011:014
If
iniquity
be
in
thine
hand,
put
it
far
away,
and
let
not
wickedness
dwell
in
thy
tabernacles.
011:015
For
then
shalt
thou
lift
up
thy
face
without
spot;
yea,
thou
shalt
be
stedfast,
and
shalt
not
fear:
011:016
Because
thou
shalt
forget
thy
misery,
and
remember
it
as
waters
that
pass
away:
011:017
And
thine
age
shall
be
clearer
than
the
noonday:
thou
shalt
shine
forth,
thou
shalt
be
as
the
morning.
011:018
And
thou
shalt
be
secure,
because
there
is
hope;
yea,
thou
shalt
dig
about
thee,
and
thou
shalt
take
thy
rest
in
safety.
011:019
Also
thou
shalt
lie
down,
and
none
shall
make
thee
afraid;
yea,
many
shall
make
suit
unto
thee.
011:020
But
the
eyes
of
the
wicked
shall
fail,
and
they
shall
not
escape,
and
their
hope
shall
be
as
the
giving
up
of
the
ghost.
012:001
And
Job
answered
and
said,
012:002
No
doubt
but
ye
are
the
people,
and
wisdom
shall
die
with
you.
012:003
But
I
have
understanding
as
well
as
you;
I
am
not
inferior
to
you:
yea,
who
knoweth
not
such
things
as
these?
012:004
I
am
as
one
mocked
of
his
neighbour,
who
calleth
upon
God,
and
he
answereth
him:
the
just
upright
man
is
laughed
to
scorn.
012:005
He
that
is
ready
to
slip
with
his
feet
is
as
a
lamp
despised
in
the
thought
of
him
that
is
at
ease.
012:006
The
tabernacles
of
robbers
prosper,
and
they
that
provoke
God
are
secure;
into
whose
hand
God
bringeth
abundantly.
012:007
But
ask
now
the
beasts,
and
they
shall
teach
thee;
and
the
fowls
of
the
air,
and
they
shall
tell
thee:
012:008
Or
speak
to
the
earth,
and
it
shall
teach
thee:
and
the
fishes
of
the
sea
shall
declare
unto
thee.
012:009
Who
knoweth
not
in
all
these
that
the
hand
of
the
LORD
hath
wrought
this?
012:010
In
whose
hand
is
the
soul
of
every
living
thing,
and
the
breath
of
all
mankind.
012:011
Doth
not
the
ear
try
words?
and
the
mouth
taste
his
meat?
012:012
With
the
ancient
is
wisdom;
and
in
length
of
days
understanding.
012:013
With
him
is
wisdom
and
strength,
he
hath
counsel
and
understanding.
012:014
Behold,
he
breaketh
down,
and
it
cannot
be
built
again:
he
shutteth
up
a
man,
and
there
can
be
no
opening.
012:015
Behold,
he
withholdeth
the
waters,
and
they
dry
up:
also
he
sendeth
them
out,
and
they
overturn
the
earth.
012:016
With
him
is
strength
and
wisdom:
the
deceived
and
the
deceiver
are
his.
012:017
He
leadeth
counsellors
away
spoiled,
and
maketh
the
judges
fools.
012:018
He
looseth
the
bond
of
kings,
and
girdeth
their
loins
with
a
girdle.
012:019
He
leadeth
princes
away
spoiled,
and
overthroweth
the
mighty.
012:020
He
removeth
away
the
speech
of
the
trusty,
and
taketh
away
the
understanding
of
the
aged.
012:021
He
poureth
contempt
upon
princes,
and
weakeneth
the
strength
of
the
mighty.
012:022
He
discovereth
deep
things
out
of
darkness,
and
bringeth
out
to
light
the
shadow
of
death.
012:023
He
increaseth
the
nations,
and
destroyeth
them:
he
enlargeth
the
nations,
and
straiteneth
them
again.
012:024
He
taketh
away
the
heart
of
the
chief
of
the
people
of
the
earth,
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
a
wilderness
where
there
is
no
way.
012:025
They
grope
in
the
dark
without
light,
and
he
maketh
them
to
stagger
like
a
drunken
man.
013:001
Lo,
mine
eye
hath
seen
all
this,
mine
ear
hath
heard
and
understood
it.
013:002
What
ye
know,
the
same
do
I
know
also:
I
am
not
inferior
unto
you.
013:003
Surely
I
would
speak
to
the
Almighty,
and
I
desire
to
reason
with
God.
013:004
But
ye
are
forgers
of
lies,
ye
are
all
physicians
of
no
value.
013:005
O
that
ye
would
altogether
hold
your
peace!
and
it
should
be
your
wisdom.
013:006
Hear
now
my
reasoning,
and
hearken
to
the
pleadings
of
my
lips.
013:007
Will
ye
speak
wickedly
for
God?
and
talk
deceitfully
for
him?
013:008
Will
ye
accept
his
person?
will
ye
contend
for
God?
013:009
Is
it
good
that
he
should
search
you
out?
or
as
one
man
mocketh
another,
do
ye
so
mock
him?
013:010
He
will
surely
reprove
you,
if
ye
do
secretly
accept
persons.
013:011
Shall
not
his
excellency
make
you
afraid?
and
his
dread
fall
upon
you?
013:012
Your
remembrances
are
like
unto
ashes,
your
bodies
to
bodies
of
clay.
013:013
Hold
your
peace,
let
me
alone,
that
I
may
speak,
and
let
come
on
me
what
will.
013:014
Wherefore
do
I
take
my
flesh
in
my
teeth,
and
put
my
life
in
mine
hand?
013:015
Though
he
slay
me,
yet
will
I
trust
in
him:
but
I
will
maintain
mine
own
ways
before
him.
013:016
He
also
shall
be
my
salvation:
for
an
hypocrite
shall
not
come
before
him.
013:017
Hear
diligently
my
speech,
and
my
declaration
with
your
ears.
013:018
Behold
now,
I
have
ordered
my
cause;
I
know
that
I
shall
be
justified.
013:019
Who
is
he
that
will
plead
with
me?
for
now,
if
I
hold
my
tongue,
I
shall
give
up
the
ghost.
013:020
Only
do
not
two
things
unto
me:
then
will
I
not
hide
myself
from
thee.
013:021
Withdraw
thine
hand
far
from
me:
and
let
not
thy
dread
make
me
afraid.
013:022
Then
call
thou,
and
I
will
answer:
or
let
me
speak,
and
answer
thou
me.
013:023
How
many
are
mine
iniquities
and
sins?
make
me
to
know
my
transgression
and
my
sin.
013:024
Wherefore
hidest
thou
thy
face,
and
holdest
me
for
thine
enemy?
013:025
Wilt
thou
break
a
leaf
driven
to
and
fro?
and
wilt
thou
pursue
the
dry
stubble?
013:026
For
thou
writest
bitter
things
against
me,
and
makest
me
to
possess
the
iniquities
of
my
youth.
013:027
Thou
puttest
my
feet
also
in
the
stocks,
and
lookest
narrowly
unto
all
my
paths;
thou
settest
a
print
upon
the
heels
of
my
feet.
013:028
And
he,
as
a
rotten
thing,
consumeth,
as
a
garment
that
is
moth
eaten.
014:001
Man
that
is
born
of
a
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble.
014:002
He
cometh
forth
like
a
flower,
and
is
cut
down:
he
fleeth
also
as
a
shadow,
and
continueth
not.
014:003
And
doth
thou
open
thine
eyes
upon
such
an
one,
and
bringest
me
into
judgment
with
thee?
014:004
Who
can
bring
a
clean
thing
out
of
an
unclean?
not
one.
014:005
Seeing
his
days
are
determined,
the
number
of
his
months
are
with
thee,
thou
hast
appointed
his
bounds
that
he
cannot
pass;
014:006
Turn
from
him,
that
he
may
rest,
till
he
shall
accomplish,
as
an
hireling,
his
day.
014:007
For
there
is
hope
of
a
tree,
if
it
be
cut
down,
that
it
will
sprout
again,
and
that
the
tender
branch
thereof
will
not
cease.
014:008
Though
the
root
thereof
wax
old
in
the
earth,
and
the
stock
thereof
die
in
the
ground;
014:009
Yet
through
the
scent
of
water
it
will
bud,
and
bring
forth
boughs
like
a
plant.
014:010
But
man
dieth,
and
wasteth
away:
yea,
man
giveth
up
the
ghost,
and
where
is
he?
014:011
As
the
waters
fail
from
the
sea,
and
the
flood
decayeth
and
drieth
up:
014:012
So
man
lieth
down,
and
riseth
not:
till
the
heavens
be
no
more,
they
shall
not
awake,
nor
be
raised
out
of
their
sleep.
014:013
O
that
thou
wouldest
hide
me
in
the
grave,
that
thou
wouldest
keep
me
secret,
until
thy
wrath
be
past,
that
thou
wouldest
appoint
me
a
set
time,
and
remember
me!
014:014
If
a
man
die,
shall
he
live
again?
all
the
days
of
my
appointed
time
will
I
wait,
till
my
change
come.
014:015
Thou
shalt
call,
and
I
will
answer
thee:
thou
wilt
have
a
desire
to
the
work
of
thine
hands.
014:016
For
now
thou
numberest
my
steps:
dost
thou
not
watch
over
my
sin?
014:017
My
transgression
is
sealed
up
in
a
bag,
and
thou
sewest
up
mine
iniquity.
014:018
And
surely
the
mountains
falling
cometh
to
nought,
and
the
rock
is
removed
out
of
his
place.
014:019
The
waters
wear
the
stones:
thou
washest
away
the
things
which
grow
out
of
the
dust
of
the
earth;
and
thou
destroyest
the
hope
of
man.
014:020
Thou
prevailest
for
ever
against
him,
and
he
passeth:
thou
changest
his
countenance,
and
sendest
him
away.
014:021
His
sons
come
to
honour,
and
he
knoweth
it
not;
and
they
are
brought
low,
but
he
perceiveth
it
not
of
them.
014:022
But
his
flesh
upon
him
shall
have
pain,
and
his
soul
within
him
shall
mourn.
015:001
Then
answered
Eliphaz
the
Temanite,
and
said,
015:002
Should
a
wise
man
utter
vain
knowledge,
and
fill
his
belly
with
the
east
wind?
015:003
Should
he
reason
with
unprofitable
talk?
or
with
speeches
wherewith
he
can
do
no
good?
015:004
Yea,
thou
castest
off
fear,
and
restrainest
prayer
before
God.
015:005
For
thy
mouth
uttereth
thine
iniquity,
and
thou
choosest
the
tongue
of
the
crafty.
015:006
Thine
own
mouth
condemneth
thee,
and
not
I:
yea,
thine
own
lips
testify
against
thee.
015:007
Art
thou
the
first
man
that
was
born?
or
wast
thou
made
before
the
hills?
015:008
Hast
thou
heard
the
secret
of
God?
and
dost
thou
restrain
wisdom
to
thyself?
015:009
What
knowest
thou,
that
we
know
not?
what
understandest
thou,
which
is
not
in
us?
015:010
With
us
are
both
the
grayheaded
and
very
aged
men,
much
elder
than
thy
father.
015:011
Are
the
consolations
of
God
small
with
thee?
is
there
any
secret
thing
with
thee?
015:012
Why
doth
thine
heart
carry
thee
away?
and
what
do
thy
eyes
wink
at,
015:013
That
thou
turnest
thy
spirit
against
God,
and
lettest
such
words
go
out
of
thy
mouth?
015:014
What
is
man,
that
he
should
be
clean?
and
he
which
is
born
of
a
woman,
that
he
should
be
righteous?
015:015
Behold,
he
putteth
no
trust
in
his
saints;
yea,
the
heavens
are
not
clean
in
his
sight.
015:016
How
much
more
abominable
and
filthy
is
man,
which
drinketh
iniquity
like
water?
015:017
I
will
shew
thee,
hear
me;
and
that
which
I
have
seen
I
will
declare;
015:018
Which
wise
men
have
told
from
their
fathers,
and
have
not
hid
it:
015:019
Unto
whom
alone
the
earth
was
given,
and
no
stranger
passed
among
them.
015:020
The
wicked
man
travaileth
with
pain
all
his
days,
and
the
number
of
years
is
hidden
to
the
oppressor.
015:021
A
dreadful
sound
is
in
his
ears:
in
prosperity
the
destroyer
shall
come
upon
him.
015:022
He
believeth
not
that
he
shall
return
out
of
darkness,
and
he
is
waited
for
of
the
sword.
015:023
He
wandereth
abroad
for
bread,
saying,
Where
is
it?
he
knoweth
that
the
day
of
darkness
is
ready
at
his
hand.
015:024
Trouble
and
anguish
shall
make
him
afraid;
they
shall
prevail
against
him,
as
a
king
ready
to
the
battle.
015:025
For
he
stretcheth
out
his
hand
against
God,
and
strengtheneth
himself
against
the
Almighty.
015:026
He
runneth
upon
him,
even
on
his
neck,
upon
the
thick
bosses
of
his
bucklers:
015:027
Because
he
covereth
his
face
with
his
fatness,
and
maketh
collops
of
fat
on
his
flanks.
015:028
And
he
dwelleth
in
desolate
cities,
and
in
houses
which
no
man
inhabiteth,
which
are
ready
to
become
heaps.
015:029
He
shall
not
be
rich,
neither
shall
his
substance
continue,
neither
shall
he
prolong
the
perfection
thereof
upon
the
earth.
015:030
He
shall
not
depart
out
of
darkness;
the
flame
shall
dry
up
his
branches,
and
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
shall
he
go
away.
015:031
Let
not
him
that
is
deceived
trust
in
vanity:
for
vanity
shall
be
his
recompence.
015:032
It
shall
be
accomplished
before
his
time,
and
his
branch
shall
not
be
green.
015:033
He
shall
shake
off
his
unripe
grape
as
the
vine,
and
shall
cast
off
his
flower
as
the
olive.
015:034
For
the
congregation
of
hypocrites
shall
be
desolate,
and
fire
shall
consume
the
tabernacles
of
bribery.
015:035
They
conceive
mischief,
and
bring
forth
vanity,
and
their
belly
prepareth
deceit.
016:001
Then
Job
answered
and
said,
016:002
I
have
heard
many
such
things:
miserable
comforters
are
ye
all.
016:003
Shall
vain
words
have
an
end?
or
what
emboldeneth
thee
that
thou
answerest?
016:004
I
also
could
speak
as
ye
do:
if
your
soul
were
in
my
soul's
stead,
I
could
heap
up
words
against
you,
and
shake
mine
head
at
you.
016:005
But
I
would
strengthen
you
with
my
mouth,
and
the
moving
of
my
lips
should
asswage
your
grief.
016:006
Though
I
speak,
my
grief
is
not
asswaged:
and
though
I
forbear,
what
am
I
eased?
016:007
But
now
he
hath
made
me
weary:
thou
hast
made
desolate
all
my
company.
016:008
And
thou
hast
filled
me
with
wrinkles,
which
is
a
witness
against
me:
and
my
leanness
rising
up
in
me
beareth
witness
to
my
face.
016:009
He
teareth
me
in
