his
wrath,
who
hateth
me:
he
gnasheth
upon
me
with
his
teeth;
mine
enemy
sharpeneth
his
eyes
upon
me.
016:010
They
have
gaped
upon
me
with
their
mouth;
they
have
smitten
me
upon
the
cheek
reproachfully;
they
have
gathered
themselves
together
against
me.
016:011
God
hath
delivered
me
to
the
ungodly,
and
turned
me
over
into
the
hands
of
the
wicked.
016:012
I
was
at
ease,
but
he
hath
broken
me
asunder:
he
hath
also
taken
me
by
my
neck,
and
shaken
me
to
pieces,
and
set
me
up
for
his
mark.
016:013
His
archers
compass
me
round
about,
he
cleaveth
my
reins
asunder,
and
doth
not
spare;
he
poureth
out
my
gall
upon
the
ground.
016:014
He
breaketh
me
with
breach
upon
breach,
he
runneth
upon
me
like
a
giant.
016:015
I
have
sewed
sackcloth
upon
my
skin,
and
defiled
my
horn
in
the
dust.
016:016
My
face
is
foul
with
weeping,
and
on
my
eyelids
is
the
shadow
of
death;
016:017
Not
for
any
injustice
in
mine
hands:
also
my
prayer
is
pure.
016:018
O
earth,
cover
not
thou
my
blood,
and
let
my
cry
have
no
place.
016:019
Also
now,
behold,
my
witness
is
in
heaven,
and
my
record
is
on
high.
016:020
My
friends
scorn
me:
but
mine
eye
poureth
out
tears
unto
God.
016:021
O
that
one
might
plead
for
a
man
with
God,
as
a
man
pleadeth
for
his
neighbour!
016:022
When
a
few
years
are
come,
then
I
shall
go
the
way
whence
I
shall
not
return.
017:001
My
breath
is
corrupt,
my
days
are
extinct,
the
graves
are
ready
for
me.
017:002
Are
there
not
mockers
with
me?
and
doth
not
mine
eye
continue
in
their
provocation?
017:003
Lay
down
now,
put
me
in
a
surety
with
thee;
who
is
he
that
will
strike
hands
with
me?
017:004
For
thou
hast
hid
their
heart
from
understanding:
therefore
shalt
thou
not
exalt
them.
017:005
He
that
speaketh
flattery
to
his
friends,
even
the
eyes
of
his
children
shall
fail.
017:006
He
hath
made
me
also
a
byword
of
the
people;
and
aforetime
I
was
as
a
tabret.
017:007
Mine
eye
also
is
dim
by
reason
of
sorrow,
and
all
my
members
are
as
a
shadow.
017:008
Upright
men
shall
be
astonied
at
this,
and
the
innocent
shall
stir
up
himself
against
the
hypocrite.
017:009
The
righteous
also
shall
hold
on
his
way,
and
he
that
hath
clean
hands
shall
be
stronger
and
stronger.
017:010
But
as
for
you
all,
do
ye
return,
and
come
now:
for
I
cannot
find
one
wise
man
among
you.
017:011
My
days
are
past,
my
purposes
are
broken
off,
even
the
thoughts
of
my
heart.
017:012
They
change
the
night
into
day:
the
light
is
short
because
of
darkness.
017:013
If
I
wait,
the
grave
is
mine
house:
I
have
made
my
bed
in
the
darkness.
017:014
I
have
said
to
corruption,
Thou
art
my
father:
to
the
worm,
Thou
art
my
mother,
and
my
sister.
017:015
And
where
is
now
my
hope?
as
for
my
hope,
who
shall
see
it?
017:016
They
shall
go
down
to
the
bars
of
the
pit,
when
our
rest
together
is
in
the
dust.
018:001
Then
answered
Bildad
the
Shuhite,
and
said,
018:002
How
long
will
it
be
ere
ye
make
an
end
of
words?
mark,
and
afterwards
we
will
speak.
018:003
Wherefore
are
we
counted
as
beasts,
and
reputed
vile
in
your
sight?
018:004
He
teareth
himself
in
his
anger:
shall
the
earth
be
forsaken
for
thee?
and
shall
the
rock
be
removed
out
of
his
place?
018:005
Yea,
the
light
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out,
and
the
spark
of
his
fire
shall
not
shine.
018:006
The
light
shall
be
dark
in
his
tabernacle,
and
his
candle
shall
be
put
out
with
him.
018:007
The
steps
of
his
strength
shall
be
straitened,
and
his
own
counsel
shall
cast
him
down.
018:008
For
he
is
cast
into
a
net
by
his
own
feet,
and
he
walketh
upon
a
snare.
018:009
The
gin
shall
take
him
by
the
heel,
and
the
robber
shall
prevail
against
him.
018:010
The
snare
is
laid
for
him
in
the
ground,
and
a
trap
for
him
in
the
way.
018:011
Terrors
shall
make
him
afraid
on
every
side,
and
shall
drive
him
to
his
feet.
018:012
His
strength
shall
be
hungerbitten,
and
destruction
shall
be
ready
at
his
side.
018:013
It
shall
devour
the
strength
of
his
skin:
even
the
firstborn
of
death
shall
devour
his
strength.
018:014
His
confidence
shall
be
rooted
out
of
his
tabernacle,
and
it
shall
bring
him
to
the
king
of
terrors.
018:015
It
shall
dwell
in
his
tabernacle,
because
it
is
none
of
his:
brimstone
shall
be
scattered
upon
his
habitation.
018:016
His
roots
shall
be
dried
up
beneath,
and
above
shall
his
branch
be
cut
off.
018:017
His
remembrance
shall
perish
from
the
earth,
and
he
shall
have
no
name
in
the
street.
018:018
He
shall
be
driven
from
light
into
darkness,
and
chased
out
of
the
world.
018:019
He
shall
neither
have
son
nor
nephew
among
his
people,
nor
any
remaining
in
his
dwellings.
018:020
They
that
come
after
him
shall
be
astonied
at
his
day,
as
they
that
went
before
were
affrighted.
018:021
Surely
such
are
the
dwellings
of
the
wicked,
and
this
is
the
place
of
him
that
knoweth
not
God.
019:001
Then
Job
answered
and
said,
019:002
How
long
will
ye
vex
my
soul,
and
break
me
in
pieces
with
words?
019:003
These
ten
times
have
ye
reproached
me:
ye
are
not
ashamed
that
ye
make
yourselves
strange
to
me.
019:004
And
be
it
indeed
that
I
have
erred,
mine
error
remaineth
with
myself.
019:005
If
indeed
ye
will
magnify
yourselves
against
me,
and
plead
against
me
my
reproach:
019:006
Know
now
that
God
hath
overthrown
me,
and
hath
compassed
me
with
his
net.
019:007
Behold,
I
cry
out
of
wrong,
but
I
am
not
heard:
I
cry
aloud,
but
there
is
no
judgment.
019:008
He
hath
fenced
up
my
way
that
I
cannot
pass,
and
he
hath
set
darkness
in
my
paths.
019:009
He
hath
stripped
me
of
my
glory,
and
taken
the
crown
from
my
head.
019:010
He
hath
destroyed
me
on
every
side,
and
I
am
gone:
and
mine
hope
hath
he
removed
like
a
tree.
019:011
He
hath
also
kindled
his
wrath
against
me,
and
he
counteth
me
unto
him
as
one
of
his
enemies.
019:012
His
troops
come
together,
and
raise
up
their
way
against
me,
and
encamp
round
about
my
tabernacle.
019:013
He
hath
put
my
brethren
far
from
me,
and
mine
acquaintance
are
verily
estranged
from
me.
019:014
My
kinsfolk
have
failed,
and
my
familiar
friends
have
forgotten
me.
019:015
They
that
dwell
in
mine
house,
and
my
maids,
count
me
for
a
stranger:
I
am
an
alien
in
their
sight.
019:016
I
called
my
servant,
and
he
gave
me
no
answer;
I
intreated
him
with
my
mouth.
019:017
My
breath
is
strange
to
my
wife,
though
I
intreated
for
the
children's
sake
of
mine
own
body.
019:018
Yea,
young
children
despised
me;
I
arose,
and
they
spake
against
me.
019:019
All
my
inward
friends
abhorred
me:
and
they
whom
I
loved
are
turned
against
me.
019:020
My
bone
cleaveth
to
my
skin
and
to
my
flesh,
and
I
am
escaped
with
the
skin
of
my
teeth.
019:021
Have
pity
upon
me,
have
pity
upon
me,
O
ye
my
friends;
for
the
hand
of
God
hath
touched
me.
019:022
Why
do
ye
persecute
me
as
God,
and
are
not
satisfied
with
my
flesh?
019:023
Oh
that
my
words
were
now
written!
oh
that
they
were
printed
in
a
book!
019:024
That
they
were
graven
with
an
iron
pen
and
lead
in
the
rock
for
ever!
019:025
For
I
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth,
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
upon
the
earth:
019:026
And
though
after
my
skin
worms
destroy
this
body,
yet
in
my
flesh
shall
I
see
God:
019:027
Whom
I
shall
see
for
myself,
and
mine
eyes
shall
behold,
and
not
another;
though
my
reins
be
consumed
within
me.
019:028
But
ye
should
say,
Why
persecute
we
him,
seeing
the
root
of
the
matter
is
found
in
me?
019:029
Be
ye
afraid
of
the
sword:
for
wrath
bringeth
the
punishments
of
the
sword,
that
ye
may
know
there
is
a
judgment.
020:001
Then
answered
Zophar
the
Naamathite,
and
said,
020:002
Therefore
do
my
thoughts
cause
me
to
answer,
and
for
this
I
make
haste.
020:003
I
have
heard
the
check
of
my
reproach,
and
the
spirit
of
my
understanding
causeth
me
to
answer.
020:004
Knowest
thou
not
this
of
old,
since
man
was
placed
upon
earth,
020:005
That
the
triumphing
of
the
wicked
is
short,
and
the
joy
of
the
hypocrite
but
for
a
moment?
020:006
Though
his
excellency
mount
up
to
the
heavens,
and
his
head
reach
unto
the
clouds;
020:007
Yet
he
shall
perish
for
ever
like
his
own
dung:
they
which
have
seen
him
shall
say,
Where
is
he?
020:008
He
shall
fly
away
as
a
dream,
and
shall
not
be
found:
yea,
he
shall
be
chased
away
as
a
vision
of
the
night.
020:009
The
eye
also
which
saw
him
shall
see
him
no
more;
neither
shall
his
place
any
more
behold
him.
020:010
His
children
shall
seek
to
please
the
poor,
and
his
hands
shall
restore
their
goods.
020:011
His
bones
are
full
of
the
sin
of
his
youth,
which
shall
lie
down
with
him
in
the
dust.
020:012
Though
wickedness
be
sweet
in
his
mouth,
though
he
hide
it
under
his
tongue;
020:013
Though
he
spare
it,
and
forsake
it
not;
but
keep
it
still
within
his
mouth:
020:014
Yet
his
meat
in
his
bowels
is
turned,
it
is
the
gall
of
asps
within
him.
020:015
He
hath
swallowed
down
riches,
and
he
shall
vomit
them
up
again:
God
shall
cast
them
out
of
his
belly.
020:016
He
shall
suck
the
poison
of
asps:
the
viper's
tongue
shall
slay
him.
020:017
He
shall
not
see
the
rivers,
the
floods,
the
brooks
of
honey
and
butter.
020:018
That
which
he
laboured
for
shall
he
restore,
and
shall
not
swallow
it
down:
according
to
his
substance
shall
the
restitution
be,
and
he
shall
not
rejoice
therein.
020:019
Because
he
hath
oppressed
and
hath
forsaken
the
poor;
because
he
hath
violently
taken
away
an
house
which
he
builded
not;
020:020
Surely
he
shall
not
feel
quietness
in
his
belly,
he
shall
not
save
of
that
which
he
desired.
020:021
There
shall
none
of
his
meat
be
left;
therefore
shall
no
man
look
for
his
goods.
020:022
In
the
fulness
of
his
sufficiency
he
shall
be
in
straits:
every
hand
of
the
wicked
shall
come
upon
him.
020:023
When
he
is
about
to
fill
his
belly,
God
shall
cast
the
fury
of
his
wrath
upon
him,
and
shall
rain
it
upon
him
while
he
is
eating.
020:024
He
shall
flee
from
the
iron
weapon,
and
the
bow
of
steel
shall
strike
him
through.
020:025
It
is
drawn,
and
cometh
out
of
the
body;
yea,
the
glittering
sword
cometh
out
of
his
gall:
terrors
are
upon
him.
020:026
All
darkness
shall
be
hid
in
his
secret
places:
a
fire
not
blown
shall
consume
him;
it
shall
go
ill
with
him
that
is
left
in
his
tabernacle.
020:027
The
heaven
shall
reveal
his
iniquity;
and
the
earth
shall
rise
up
against
him.
020:028
The
increase
of
his
house
shall
depart,
and
his
goods
shall
flow
away
in
the
day
of
his
wrath.
020:029
This
is
the
portion
of
a
wicked
man
from
God,
and
the
heritage
appointed
unto
him
by
God.
021:001
But
Job
answered
and
said,
021:002
Hear
diligently
my
speech,
and
let
this
be
your
consolations.
021:003
Suffer
me
that
I
may
speak;
and
after
that
I
have
spoken,
mock
on.
021:004
As
for
me,
is
my
complaint
to
man?
and
if
it
were
so,
why
should
not
my
spirit
be
troubled?
021:005
Mark
me,
and
be
astonished,
and
lay
your
hand
upon
your
mouth.
021:006
Even
when
I
remember
I
am
afraid,
and
trembling
taketh
hold
on
my
flesh.
021:007
Wherefore
do
the
wicked
live,
become
old,
yea,
are
mighty
in
power?
021:008
Their
seed
is
established
in
their
sight
with
them,
and
their
offspring
before
their
eyes.
021:009
Their
houses
are
safe
from
fear,
neither
is
the
rod
of
God
upon
them.
021:010
Their
bull
gendereth,
and
faileth
not;
their
cow
calveth,
and
casteth
not
her
calf.
021:011
They
send
forth
their
little
ones
like
a
flock,
and
their
children
dance.
021:012
They
take
the
timbrel
and
harp,
and
rejoice
at
the
sound
of
the
organ.
021:013
They
spend
their
days
in
wealth,
and
in
a
moment
go
down
to
the
grave.
021:014
Therefore
they
say
unto
God,
Depart
from
us;
for
we
desire
not
the
knowledge
of
thy
ways.
021:015
What
is
the
Almighty,
that
we
should
serve
him?
and
what
profit
should
we
have,
if
we
pray
unto
him?
021:016
Lo,
their
good
is
not
in
their
hand:
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
is
far
from
me.
021:017
How
oft
is
the
candle
of
the
wicked
put
out!
and
how
oft
cometh
their
destruction
upon
them!
God
distributeth
sorrows
in
his
anger.
021:018
They
are
as
stubble
before
the
wind,
and
as
chaff
that
the
storm
carrieth
away.
021:019
God
layeth
up
his
iniquity
for
his
children:
he
rewardeth
him,
and
he
shall
know
it.
021:020
His
eyes
shall
see
his
destruction,
and
he
shall
drink
of
the
wrath
of
the
Almighty.
021:021
For
what
pleasure
hath
he
in
his
house
after
him,
when
the
number
of
his
months
is
cut
off
in
the
midst?
021:022
Shall
any
teach
God
knowledge?
seeing
he
judgeth
those
that
are
high.
021:023
One
dieth
in
his
full
strength,
being
wholly
at
ease
and
quiet.
021:024
His
breasts
are
full
of
milk,
and
his
bones
are
moistened
with
marrow.
021:025
And
another
dieth
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul,
and
never
eateth
with
pleasure.
021:026
They
shall
lie
down
alike
in
the
dust,
and
the
worms
shall
cover
them.
021:027
Behold,
I
know
your
thoughts,
and
the
devices
which
ye
wrongfully
imagine
against
me.
021:028
For
ye
say,
Where
is
the
house
of
the
prince?
and
where
are
the
dwelling
places
of
the
wicked?
021:029
Have
ye
not
asked
them
that
go
by
the
way?
and
do
ye
not
know
their
tokens,
021:030
That
the
wicked
is
reserved
to
the
day
of
destruction?
they
shall
be
brought
forth
to
the
day
of
wrath.
021:031
Who
shall
declare
his
way
to
his
face?
and
who
shall
repay
him
what
he
hath
done?
021:032
Yet
shall
he
be
brought
to
the
grave,
and
shall
remain
in
the
tomb.
021:033
The
clods
of
the
valley
shall
be
sweet
unto
him,
and
every
man
shall
draw
after
him,
as
there
are
innumerable
before
him.
021:034
How
then
comfort
ye
me
in
vain,
seeing
in
your
answers
there
remaineth
falsehood?
022:001
Then
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
answered
and
said,
022:002
Can
a
man
be
profitable
unto
God,
as
he
that
is
wise
may
be
profitable
unto
himself?
022:003
Is
it
any
pleasure
to
the
Almighty,
that
thou
art
righteous?
or
is
it
gain
to
him,
that
thou
makest
thy
ways
perfect?
022:004
Will
he
reprove
thee
for
fear
of
thee?
will
he
enter
with
thee
into
judgment?
022:005
Is
not
thy
wickedness
great?
and
thine
iniquities
infinite?
022:006
For
thou
hast
taken
a
pledge
from
thy
brother
for
nought,
and
stripped
the
naked
of
their
clothing.
022:007
Thou
hast
not
given
water
to
the
weary
to
drink,
and
thou
hast
withholden
bread
from
the
hungry.
022:008
But
as
for
the
mighty
man,
he
had
the
earth;
and
the
honourable
man
dwelt
in
it.
022:009
Thou
hast
sent
widows
away
empty,
and
the
arms
of
the
fatherless
have
been
broken.
022:010
Therefore
snares
are
round
about
thee,
and
sudden
fear
troubleth
thee;
022:011
Or
darkness,
that
thou
canst
not
see;
and
abundance
of
waters
cover
thee.
022:012
Is
not
God
in
the
height
of
heaven?
and
behold
the
height
of
the
stars,
how
high
they
are!
022:013
And
thou
sayest,
How
doth
God
know?
can
he
judge
through
the
dark
cloud?
022:014
Thick
clouds
are
a
covering
to
him,
that
he
seeth
not;
and
he
walketh
in
the
circuit
of
heaven.
022:015
Hast
thou
marked
the
old
way
which
wicked
men
have
trodden?
022:016
Which
were
cut
down
out
of
time,
whose
foundation
was
overflown
with
a
flood:
022:017
Which
said
unto
God,
Depart
from
us:
and
what
can
the
Almighty
do
for
them?
022:018
Yet
he
filled
their
houses
with
good
things:
but
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
is
far
from
me.
022:019
The
righteous
see
it,
and
are
glad:
and
the
innocent
laugh
them
to
scorn.
022:020
Whereas
our
substance
is
not
cut
down,
but
the
remnant
of
them
the
fire
consumeth.
022:021
Acquaint
now
thyself
with
him,
and
be
at
peace:
thereby
good
shall
come
unto
thee.
022:022
Receive,
I
pray
thee,
the
law
from
his
mouth,
and
lay
up
his
words
in
thine
heart.
022:023
If
thou
return
to
the
Almighty,
thou
shalt
be
built
up,
thou
shalt
put
away
iniquity
far
from
thy
tabernacles.
022:024
Then
shalt
thou
lay
up
gold
as
dust,
and
the
gold
of
Ophir
as
the
stones
of
the
brooks.
022:025
Yea,
the
Almighty
shall
be
thy
defence,
and
thou
shalt
have
plenty
of
silver.
022:026
For
then
shalt
thou
have
thy
delight
in
the
Almighty,
and
shalt
lift
up
thy
face
unto
God.
022:027
Thou
shalt
make
thy
prayer
unto
him,
and
he
shall
hear
thee,
and
thou
shalt
pay
thy
vows.
022:028
Thou
shalt
also
decree
a
thing,
and
it
shall
be
established
unto
thee:
and
the
light
shall
shine
upon
thy
ways.
022:029
When
men
are
cast
down,
then
thou
shalt
say,
There
is
lifting
up;
and
he
shall
save
the
humble
person.
022:030
He
shall
deliver
the
island
of
the
innocent:
and
it
is
delivered
by
the
pureness
of
thine
hands.
023:001
Then
Job
answered
and
said,
023:002
Even
to
day
is
my
complaint
bitter:
my
stroke
is
heavier
than
my
groaning.
023:003
Oh
that
I
knew
where
I
might
find
him!
that
I
might
come
even
to
his
seat!
023:004
I
would
order
my
cause
before
him,
and
fill
my
mouth
with
arguments.
023:005
I
would
know
the
words
which
he
would
answer
me,
and
understand
what
he
would
say
unto
me.
023:006
Will
he
plead
against
me
with
his
great
power?
No;
but
he
would
put
strength
in
me.
023:007
There
the
righteous
might
dispute
with
him;
so
should
I
be
delivered
for
ever
from
my
judge.
023:008
Behold,
I
go
forward,
but
he
is
not
there;
and
backward,
but
I
cannot
perceive
him:
023:009
On
the
left
hand,
where
he
doth
work,
but
I
cannot
behold
him:
he
hideth
himself
on
the
right
hand,
that
I
cannot
see
him:
023:010
But
he
knoweth
the
way
that
I
take:
when
he
hath
tried
me,
I
shall
come
forth
as
gold.
023:011
My
foot
hath
held
his
steps,
his
way
have
I
kept,
and
not
declined.
023:012
Neither
have
I
gone
back
from
the
commandment
of
his
lips;
I
have
esteemed
the
words
of
his
mouth
more
than
my
necessary
food.
023:013
But
he
is
in
one
mind,
and
who
can
turn
him?
and
what
his
soul
desireth,
even
that
he
doeth.
023:014
For
he
performeth
the
thing
that
is
appointed
for
me:
and
many
such
things
are
with
him.
023:015
Therefore
am
I
troubled
at
his
presence:
when
I
consider,
I
am
afraid
of
him.
023:016
For
God
maketh
my
heart
soft,
and
the
Almighty
troubleth
me:
023:017
Because
I
was
not
cut
off
before
the
darkness,
neither
hath
he
covered
the
darkness
from
my
face.
024:001
Why,
seeing
times
are
not
hidden
from
the
Almighty,
do
they
that
know
him
not
see
his
days?
024:002
Some
remove
the
landmarks;
they
violently
take
away
flocks,
and
feed
thereof.
024:003
They
drive
away
the
ass
of
the
fatherless,
they
take
the
widow's
ox
for
a
pledge.
024:004
They
turn
the
needy
out
of
the
way:
the
poor
of
the
earth
hide
themselves
together.
024:005
Behold,
as
wild
asses
in
the
desert,
go
they
forth
to
their
work;
rising
betimes
for
a
prey:
the
wilderness
yieldeth
food
for
them
and
for
their
children.
024:006
They
reap
every
one
his
corn
in
the
field:
and
they
gather
the
vintage
of
the
wicked.
024:007
They
cause
the
naked
to
lodge
without
clothing,
that
they
have
no
covering
in
the
cold.
024:008
They
are
wet
with
the
showers
of
the
mountains,
and
embrace
the
rock
for
want
of
a
shelter.
024:009
They
pluck
the
fatherless
from
the
breast,
and
take
a
pledge
of
the
poor.
024:010
They
cause
him
to
go
naked
without
clothing,
and
they
take
away
the
sheaf
from
the
hungry;
024:011
Which
make
oil
within
their
walls,
and
tread
their
winepresses,
and
suffer
thirst.
024:012
Men
groan
from
out
of
the
city,
and
the
soul
of
the
wounded
crieth
out:
yet
God
layeth
not
folly
to
them.
024:013
They
are
of
those
that
rebel
against
the
light;
they
know
not
the
ways
thereof,
nor
abide
in
the
paths
thereof.
024:014
The
murderer
rising
with
the
light
killeth
the
poor
and
needy,
and
in
the
night
is
as
a
thief.
024:015
The
eye
also
of
the
adulterer
waiteth
for
the
twilight,
saying,
No
eye
shall
see
me:
and
disguiseth
his
face.
024:016
In
the
dark
they
dig
through
houses,
which
they
had
marked
for
themselves
in
the
daytime:
they
know
not
the
light.
024:017
For
the
morning
is
to
them
even
as
the
shadow
of
death:
if
one
know
them,
they
are
in
the
terrors
of
the
shadow
of
death.
024:018
He
is
swift
as
the
waters;
their
portion
is
cursed
in
the
earth:
he
beholdeth
not
the
way
of
the
vineyards.
024:019
Drought
and
heat
consume
the
snow
waters:
so
doth
the
grave
those
which
have
sinned.
024:020
The
womb
shall
forget
him;
the
worm
shall
feed
sweetly
on
him;
he
shall
be
no
more
remembered;
and
wickedness
shall
be
broken
as
a
tree.
024:021
He
evil
entreateth
the
barren
that
beareth
not:
and
doeth
not
good
to
the
widow.
024:022
He
draweth
also
the
mighty
with
his
power:
he
riseth
up,
and
no
man
is
sure
of
life.
024:023
Though
it
be
given
him
to
be
in
safety,
whereon
he
resteth;
yet
his
eyes
are
upon
their
ways.
024:024
They
are
exalted
for
a
little
while,
but
are
gone
and
brought
low;
they
are
taken
out
of
the
way
as
all
other,
and
cut
off
as
the
tops
of
the
ears
of
corn.
024:025
And
if
it
be
not
so
now,
who
will
make
me
a
liar,
and
make
my
speech
nothing
worth?
025:001
Then
answered
Bildad
the
Shuhite,
and
said,
025:002
Dominion
and
fear
are
with
him,
he
maketh
peace
in
his
high
places.
025:003
Is
there
any
number
of
his
armies?
and
upon
whom
doth
not
his
light
arise?
025:004
How
then
can
man
be
justified
with
God?
or
how
can
he
be
clean
that
is
born
of
a
woman?
025:005
Behold
even
to
the
moon,
and
it
shineth
not;
yea,
the
stars
are
not
pure
in
his
sight.
025:006
How
much
less
man,
that
is
a
worm?
and
the
son
of
man,
which
is
a
worm?
026:001
But
Job
answered
and
said,
026:002
How
hast
thou
helped
him
that
is
without
power?
how
savest
thou
the
arm
that
hath
no
strength?
026:003
How
hast
thou
counselled
him
that
hath
no
wisdom?
and
how
hast
thou
plentifully
declared
the
thing
as
it
is?
026:004
To
whom
hast
thou
uttered
words?
and
whose
spirit
came
from
thee?
026:005
Dead
things
are
formed
from
under
the
waters,
and
the
inhabitants
thereof.
026:006
Hell
is
naked
before
him,
and
destruction
hath
no
covering.
026:007
He
stretcheth
out
the
north
over
the
empty
place,
and
hangeth
the
earth
upon
nothing.
026:008
He
bindeth
up
the
waters
in
his
thick
clouds;
and
the
cloud
is
not
rent
under
them.
026:009
He
holdeth
back
the
face
of
his
throne,
and
spreadeth
his
cloud
upon
it.
026:010
He
hath
compassed
the
waters
with
bounds,
until
the
day
and
night
come
to
an
end.
026:011
The
pillars
of
heaven
tremble
and
are
astonished
at
his
reproof.
026:012
He
divideth
the
sea
with
his
power,
and
by
his
understanding
he
smiteth
through
the
proud.
026:013
By
