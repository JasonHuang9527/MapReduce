his
spirit
he
hath
garnished
the
heavens;
his
hand
hath
formed
the
crooked
serpent.
026:014
Lo,
these
are
parts
of
his
ways:
but
how
little
a
portion
is
heard
of
him?
but
the
thunder
of
his
power
who
can
understand?
027:001
Moreover
Job
continued
his
parable,
and
said,
027:002
As
God
liveth,
who
hath
taken
away
my
judgment;
and
the
Almighty,
who
hath
vexed
my
soul;
027:003
All
the
while
my
breath
is
in
me,
and
the
spirit
of
God
is
in
my
nostrils;
027:004
My
lips
shall
not
speak
wickedness,
nor
my
tongue
utter
deceit.
027:005
God
forbid
that
I
should
justify
you:
till
I
die
I
will
not
remove
mine
integrity
from
me.
027:006
My
righteousness
I
hold
fast,
and
will
not
let
it
go:
my
heart
shall
not
reproach
me
so
long
as
I
live.
027:007
Let
mine
enemy
be
as
the
wicked,
and
he
that
riseth
up
against
me
as
the
unrighteous.
027:008
For
what
is
the
hope
of
the
hypocrite,
though
he
hath
gained,
when
God
taketh
away
his
soul?
027:009
Will
God
hear
his
cry
when
trouble
cometh
upon
him?
027:010
Will
he
delight
himself
in
the
Almighty?
will
he
always
call
upon
God?
027:011
I
will
teach
you
by
the
hand
of
God:
that
which
is
with
the
Almighty
will
I
not
conceal.
027:012
Behold,
all
ye
yourselves
have
seen
it;
why
then
are
ye
thus
altogether
vain?
027:013
This
is
the
portion
of
a
wicked
man
with
God,
and
the
heritage
of
oppressors,
which
they
shall
receive
of
the
Almighty.
027:014
If
his
children
be
multiplied,
it
is
for
the
sword:
and
his
offspring
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
bread.
027:015
Those
that
remain
of
him
shall
be
buried
in
death:
and
his
widows
shall
not
weep.
027:016
Though
he
heap
up
silver
as
the
dust,
and
prepare
raiment
as
the
clay;
027:017
He
may
prepare
it,
but
the
just
shall
put
it
on,
and
the
innocent
shall
divide
the
silver.
027:018
He
buildeth
his
house
as
a
moth,
and
as
a
booth
that
the
keeper
maketh.
027:019
The
rich
man
shall
lie
down,
but
he
shall
not
be
gathered:
he
openeth
his
eyes,
and
he
is
not.
027:020
Terrors
take
hold
on
him
as
waters,
a
tempest
stealeth
him
away
in
the
night.
027:021
The
east
wind
carrieth
him
away,
and
he
departeth:
and
as
a
storm
hurleth
him
out
of
his
place.
027:022
For
God
shall
cast
upon
him,
and
not
spare:
he
would
fain
flee
out
of
his
hand.
027:023
Men
shall
clap
their
hands
at
him,
and
shall
hiss
him
out
of
his
place.
028:001
Surely
there
is
a
vein
for
the
silver,
and
a
place
for
gold
where
they
fine
it.
028:002
Iron
is
taken
out
of
the
earth,
and
brass
is
molten
out
of
the
stone.
028:003
He
setteth
an
end
to
darkness,
and
searcheth
out
all
perfection:
the
stones
of
darkness,
and
the
shadow
of
death.
028:004
The
flood
breaketh
out
from
the
inhabitant;
even
the
waters
forgotten
of
the
foot:
they
are
dried
up,
they
are
gone
away
from
men.
028:005
As
for
the
earth,
out
of
it
cometh
bread:
and
under
it
is
turned
up
as
it
were
fire.
028:006
The
stones
of
it
are
the
place
of
sapphires:
and
it
hath
dust
of
gold.
028:007
There
is
a
path
which
no
fowl
knoweth,
and
which
the
vulture's
eye
hath
not
seen:
028:008
The
lion's
whelps
have
not
trodden
it,
nor
the
fierce
lion
passed
by
it.
028:009
He
putteth
forth
his
hand
upon
the
rock;
he
overturneth
the
mountains
by
the
roots.
028:010
He
cutteth
out
rivers
among
the
rocks;
and
his
eye
seeth
every
precious
thing.
028:011
He
bindeth
the
floods
from
overflowing;
and
the
thing
that
is
hid
bringeth
he
forth
to
light.
028:012
But
where
shall
wisdom
be
found?
and
where
is
the
place
of
understanding?
028:013
Man
knoweth
not
the
price
thereof;
neither
is
it
found
in
the
land
of
the
living.
028:014
The
depth
saith,
It
is
not
in
me:
and
the
sea
saith,
It
is
not
with
me.
028:015
It
cannot
be
gotten
for
gold,
neither
shall
silver
be
weighed
for
the
price
thereof.
028:016
It
cannot
be
valued
with
the
gold
of
Ophir,
with
the
precious
onyx,
or
the
sapphire.
028:017
The
gold
and
the
crystal
cannot
equal
it:
and
the
exchange
of
it
shall
not
be
for
jewels
of
fine
gold.
028:018
No
mention
shall
be
made
of
coral,
or
of
pearls:
for
the
price
of
wisdom
is
above
rubies.
028:019
The
topaz
of
Ethiopia
shall
not
equal
it,
neither
shall
it
be
valued
with
pure
gold.
028:020
Whence
then
cometh
wisdom?
and
where
is
the
place
of
understanding?
028:021
Seeing
it
is
hid
from
the
eyes
of
all
living,
and
kept
close
from
the
fowls
of
the
air.
028:022
Destruction
and
death
say,
We
have
heard
the
fame
thereof
with
our
ears.
028:023
God
understandeth
the
way
thereof,
and
he
knoweth
the
place
thereof.
028:024
For
he
looketh
to
the
ends
of
the
earth,
and
seeth
under
the
whole
heaven;
028:025
To
make
the
weight
for
the
winds;
and
he
weigheth
the
waters
by
measure.
028:026
When
he
made
a
decree
for
the
rain,
and
a
way
for
the
lightning
of
the
thunder:
028:027
Then
did
he
see
it,
and
declare
it;
he
prepared
it,
yea,
and
searched
it
out.
028:028
And
unto
man
he
said,
Behold,
the
fear
of
the
LORD,
that
is
wisdom;
and
to
depart
from
evil
is
understanding.
029:001
Moreover
Job
continued
his
parable,
and
said,
029:002
Oh
that
I
were
as
in
months
past,
as
in
the
days
when
God
preserved
me;
029:003
When
his
candle
shined
upon
my
head,
and
when
by
his
light
I
walked
through
darkness;
029:004
As
I
was
in
the
days
of
my
youth,
when
the
secret
of
God
was
upon
my
tabernacle;
029:005
When
the
Almighty
was
yet
with
me,
when
my
children
were
about
me;
029:006
When
I
washed
my
steps
with
butter,
and
the
rock
poured
me
out
rivers
of
oil;
029:007
When
I
went
out
to
the
gate
through
the
city,
when
I
prepared
my
seat
in
the
street!
029:008
The
young
men
saw
me,
and
hid
themselves:
and
the
aged
arose,
and
stood
up.
029:009
The
princes
refrained
talking,
and
laid
their
hand
on
their
mouth.
029:010
The
nobles
held
their
peace,
and
their
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
their
mouth.
029:011
When
the
ear
heard
me,
then
it
blessed
me;
and
when
the
eye
saw
me,
it
gave
witness
to
me:
029:012
Because
I
delivered
the
poor
that
cried,
and
the
fatherless,
and
him
that
had
none
to
help
him.
029:013
The
blessing
of
him
that
was
ready
to
perish
came
upon
me:
and
I
caused
the
widow's
heart
to
sing
for
joy.
029:014
I
put
on
righteousness,
and
it
clothed
me:
my
judgment
was
as
a
robe
and
a
diadem.
029:015
I
was
eyes
to
the
blind,
and
feet
was
I
to
the
lame.
029:016
I
was
a
father
to
the
poor:
and
the
cause
which
I
knew
not
I
searched
out.
029:017
And
I
brake
the
jaws
of
the
wicked,
and
plucked
the
spoil
out
of
his
teeth.
029:018
Then
I
said,
I
shall
die
in
my
nest,
and
I
shall
multiply
my
days
as
the
sand.
029:019
My
root
was
spread
out
by
the
waters,
and
the
dew
lay
all
night
upon
my
branch.
029:020
My
glory
was
fresh
in
me,
and
my
bow
was
renewed
in
my
hand.
029:021
Unto
me
men
gave
ear,
and
waited,
and
kept
silence
at
my
counsel.
029:022
After
my
words
they
spake
not
again;
and
my
speech
dropped
upon
them.
029:023
And
they
waited
for
me
as
for
the
rain;
and
they
opened
their
mouth
wide
as
for
the
latter
rain.
029:024
If
I
laughed
on
them,
they
believed
it
not;
and
the
light
of
my
countenance
they
cast
not
down.
029:025
I
chose
out
their
way,
and
sat
chief,
and
dwelt
as
a
king
in
the
army,
as
one
that
comforteth
the
mourners.
030:001
But
now
they
that
are
younger
than
I
have
me
in
derision,
whose
fathers
I
would
have
disdained
to
have
set
with
the
dogs
of
my
flock.
030:002
Yea,
whereto
might
the
strength
of
their
hands
profit
me,
in
whom
old
age
was
perished?
030:003
For
want
and
famine
they
were
solitary;
fleeing
into
the
wilderness
in
former
time
desolate
and
waste.
030:004
Who
cut
up
mallows
by
the
bushes,
and
juniper
roots
for
their
meat.
030:005
They
were
driven
forth
from
among
men,
(they
cried
after
them
as
after
a
thief;)
030:006
To
dwell
in
the
cliffs
of
the
valleys,
in
caves
of
the
earth,
and
in
the
rocks.
030:007
Among
the
bushes
they
brayed;
under
the
nettles
they
were
gathered
together.
030:008
They
were
children
of
fools,
yea,
children
of
base
men:
they
were
viler
than
the
earth.
030:009
And
now
am
I
their
song,
yea,
I
am
their
byword.
030:010
They
abhor
me,
they
flee
far
from
me,
and
spare
not
to
spit
in
my
face.
030:011
Because
he
hath
loosed
my
cord,
and
afflicted
me,
they
have
also
let
loose
the
bridle
before
me.
030:012
Upon
my
right
hand
rise
the
youth;
they
push
away
my
feet,
and
they
raise
up
against
me
the
ways
of
their
destruction.
030:013
They
mar
my
path,
they
set
forward
my
calamity,
they
have
no
helper.
030:014
They
came
upon
me
as
a
wide
breaking
in
of
waters:
in
the
desolation
they
rolled
themselves
upon
me.
030:015
Terrors
are
turned
upon
me:
they
pursue
my
soul
as
the
wind:
and
my
welfare
passeth
away
as
a
cloud.
030:016
And
now
my
soul
is
poured
out
upon
me;
the
days
of
affliction
have
taken
hold
upon
me.
030:017
My
bones
are
pierced
in
me
in
the
night
season:
and
my
sinews
take
no
rest.
030:018
By
the
great
force
of
my
disease
is
my
garment
changed:
it
bindeth
me
about
as
the
collar
of
my
coat.
030:019
He
hath
cast
me
into
the
mire,
and
I
am
become
like
dust
and
ashes.
030:020
I
cry
unto
thee,
and
thou
dost
not
hear
me:
I
stand
up,
and
thou
regardest
me
not.
030:021
Thou
art
become
cruel
to
me:
with
thy
strong
hand
thou
opposest
thyself
against
me.
030:022
Thou
liftest
me
up
to
the
wind;
thou
causest
me
to
ride
upon
it,
and
dissolvest
my
substance.
030:023
For
I
know
that
thou
wilt
bring
me
to
death,
and
to
the
house
appointed
for
all
living.
030:024
Howbeit
he
will
not
stretch
out
his
hand
to
the
grave,
though
they
cry
in
his
destruction.
030:025
Did
not
I
weep
for
him
that
was
in
trouble?
was
not
my
soul
grieved
for
the
poor?
030:026
When
I
looked
for
good,
then
evil
came
unto
me:
and
when
I
waited
for
light,
there
came
darkness.
030:027
My
bowels
boiled,
and
rested
not:
the
days
of
affliction
prevented
me.
030:028
I
went
mourning
without
the
sun:
I
stood
up,
and
I
cried
in
the
congregation.
030:029
I
am
a
brother
to
dragons,
and
a
companion
to
owls.
030:030
My
skin
is
black
upon
me,
and
my
bones
are
burned
with
heat.
030:031
My
harp
also
is
turned
to
mourning,
and
my
organ
into
the
voice
of
them
that
weep.
031:001
I
made
a
covenant
with
mine
eyes;
why
then
should
I
think
upon
a
maid?
031:002
For
what
portion
of
God
is
there
from
above?
and
what
inheritance
of
the
Almighty
from
on
high?
031:003
Is
not
destruction
to
the
wicked?
and
a
strange
punishment
to
the
workers
of
iniquity?
031:004
Doth
not
he
see
my
ways,
and
count
all
my
steps?
031:005
If
I
have
walked
with
vanity,
or
if
my
foot
hath
hasted
to
deceit;
031:006
Let
me
be
weighed
in
an
even
balance
that
God
may
know
mine
integrity.
031:007
If
my
step
hath
turned
out
of
the
way,
and
mine
heart
walked
after
mine
eyes,
and
if
any
blot
hath
cleaved
to
mine
hands;
031:008
Then
let
me
sow,
and
let
another
eat;
yea,
let
my
offspring
be
rooted
out.
031:009
If
mine
heart
have
been
deceived
by
a
woman,
or
if
I
have
laid
wait
at
my
neighbour's
door;
031:010
Then
let
my
wife
grind
unto
another,
and
let
others
bow
down
upon
her.
031:011
For
this
is
an
heinous
crime;
yea,
it
is
an
iniquity
to
be
punished
by
the
judges.
031:012
For
it
is
a
fire
that
consumeth
to
destruction,
and
would
root
out
all
mine
increase.
031:013
If
I
did
despise
the
cause
of
my
manservant
or
of
my
maidservant,
when
they
contended
with
me;
031:014
What
then
shall
I
do
when
God
riseth
up?
and
when
he
visiteth,
what
shall
I
answer
him?
031:015
Did
not
he
that
made
me
in
the
womb
make
him?
and
did
not
one
fashion
us
in
the
womb?
031:016
If
I
have
withheld
the
poor
from
their
desire,
or
have
caused
the
eyes
of
the
widow
to
fail;
031:017
Or
have
eaten
my
morsel
myself
alone,
and
the
fatherless
hath
not
eaten
thereof;
031:018
(For
from
my
youth
he
was
brought
up
with
me,
as
with
a
father,
and
I
have
guided
her
from
my
mother's
womb;)
031:019
If
I
have
seen
any
perish
for
want
of
clothing,
or
any
poor
without
covering;
031:020
If
his
loins
have
not
blessed
me,
and
if
he
were
not
warmed
with
the
fleece
of
my
sheep;
031:021
If
I
have
lifted
up
my
hand
against
the
fatherless,
when
I
saw
my
help
in
the
gate:
031:022
Then
let
mine
arm
fall
from
my
shoulder
blade,
and
mine
arm
be
broken
from
the
bone.
031:023
For
destruction
from
God
was
a
terror
to
me,
and
by
reason
of
his
highness
I
could
not
endure.
031:024
If
I
have
made
gold
my
hope,
or
have
said
to
the
fine
gold,
Thou
art
my
confidence;
031:025
If
I
rejoice
because
my
wealth
was
great,
and
because
mine
hand
had
gotten
much;
031:026
If
I
beheld
the
sun
when
it
shined,
or
the
moon
walking
in
brightness;
031:027
And
my
heart
hath
been
secretly
enticed,
or
my
mouth
hath
kissed
my
hand:
031:028
This
also
were
an
iniquity
to
be
punished
by
the
judge:
for
I
should
have
denied
the
God
that
is
above.
031:029
If
I
rejoice
at
the
destruction
of
him
that
hated
me,
or
lifted
up
myself
when
evil
found
him:
031:030
Neither
have
I
suffered
my
mouth
to
sin
by
wishing
a
curse
to
his
soul.
031:031
If
the
men
of
my
tabernacle
said
not,
Oh
that
we
had
of
his
flesh!
we
cannot
be
satisfied.
031:032
The
stranger
did
not
lodge
in
the
street:
but
I
opened
my
doors
to
the
traveller.
031:033
If
I
covered
my
transgressions
as
Adam,
by
hiding
mine
iniquity
in
my
bosom:
031:034
Did
I
fear
a
great
multitude,
or
did
the
contempt
of
families
terrify
me,
that
I
kept
silence,
and
went
not
out
of
the
door?
031:035
Oh
that
one
would
hear
me!
behold,
my
desire
is,
that
the
Almighty
would
answer
me,
and
that
mine
adversary
had
written
a
book.
031:036
Surely
I
would
take
it
upon
my
shoulder,
and
bind
it
as
a
crown
to
me.
031:037
I
would
declare
unto
him
the
number
of
my
steps;
as
a
prince
would
I
go
near
unto
him.
031:038
If
my
land
cry
against
me,
or
that
the
furrows
likewise
thereof
complain;
031:039
If
I
have
eaten
the
fruits
thereof
without
money,
or
have
caused
the
owners
thereof
to
lose
their
life:
031:040
Let
thistles
grow
instead
of
wheat,
and
cockle
instead
of
barley.
The
words
of
Job
are
ended.
032:001
So
these
three
men
ceased
to
answer
Job,
because
he
was
righteous
in
his
own
eyes.
032:002
Then
was
kindled
the
wrath
of
Elihu
the
son
of
Barachel
the
Buzite,
of
the
kindred
of
Ram:
against
Job
was
his
wrath
kindled,
because
he
justified
himself
rather
than
God.
032:003
Also
against
his
three
friends
was
his
wrath
kindled,
because
they
had
found
no
answer,
and
yet
had
condemned
Job.
032:004
Now
Elihu
had
waited
till
Job
had
spoken,
because
they
were
elder
than
he.
032:005
When
Elihu
saw
that
there
was
no
answer
in
the
mouth
of
these
three
men,
then
his
wrath
was
kindled.
032:006
And
Elihu
the
son
of
Barachel
the
Buzite
answered
and
said,
I
am
young,
and
ye
are
very
old;
wherefore
I
was
afraid,
and
durst
not
shew
you
mine
opinion.
032:007
I
said,
Days
should
speak,
and
multitude
of
years
should
teach
wisdom.
032:008
But
there
is
a
spirit
in
man:
and
the
inspiration
of
the
Almighty
giveth
them
understanding.
032:009
Great
men
are
not
always
wise:
neither
do
the
aged
understand
judgment.
032:010
Therefore
I
said,
Hearken
to
me;
I
also
will
shew
mine
opinion.
032:011
Behold,
I
waited
for
your
words;
I
gave
ear
to
your
reasons,
whilst
ye
searched
out
what
to
say.
032:012
Yea,
I
attended
unto
you,
and,
behold,
there
was
none
of
you
that
convinced
Job,
or
that
answered
his
words:
032:013
Lest
ye
should
say,
We
have
found
out
wisdom:
God
thrusteth
him
down,
not
man.
032:014
Now
he
hath
not
directed
his
words
against
me:
neither
will
I
answer
him
with
your
speeches.
032:015
They
were
amazed,
they
answered
no
more:
they
left
off
speaking.
032:016
When
I
had
waited,
(for
they
spake
not,
but
stood
still,
and
answered
no
more;)
032:017
I
said,
I
will
answer
also
my
part,
I
also
will
shew
mine
opinion.
032:018
For
I
am
full
of
matter,
the
spirit
within
me
constraineth
me.
032:019
Behold,
my
belly
is
as
wine
which
hath
no
vent;
it
is
ready
to
burst
like
new
bottles.
032:020
I
will
speak,
that
I
may
be
refreshed:
I
will
open
my
lips
and
answer.
032:021
Let
me
not,
I
pray
you,
accept
any
man's
person,
neither
let
me
give
flattering
titles
unto
man.
032:022
For
I
know
not
to
give
flattering
titles;
in
so
doing
my
maker
would
soon
take
me
away.
033:001
Wherefore,
Job,
I
pray
thee,
hear
my
speeches,
and
hearken
to
all
my
words.
033:002
Behold,
now
I
have
opened
my
mouth,
my
tongue
hath
spoken
in
my
mouth.
033:003
My
words
shall
be
of
the
uprightness
of
my
heart:
and
my
lips
shall
utter
knowledge
clearly.
033:004
The
spirit
of
God
hath
made
me,
and
the
breath
of
the
Almighty
hath
given
me
life.
033:005
If
thou
canst
answer
me,
set
thy
words
in
order
before
me,
stand
up.
033:006
Behold,
I
am
according
to
thy
wish
in
God's
stead:
I
also
am
formed
out
of
the
clay.
033:007
Behold,
my
terror
shall
not
make
thee
afraid,
neither
shall
my
hand
be
heavy
upon
thee.
033:008
Surely
thou
hast
spoken
in
mine
hearing,
and
I
have
heard
the
voice
of
thy
words,
saying,
033:009
I
am
clean
without
transgression,
I
am
innocent;
neither
is
there
iniquity
in
me.
033:010
Behold,
he
findeth
occasions
against
me,
he
counteth
me
for
his
enemy,
033:011
He
putteth
my
feet
in
the
stocks,
he
marketh
all
my
paths.
033:012
Behold,
in
this
thou
art
not
just:
I
will
answer
thee,
that
God
is
greater
than
man.
033:013
Why
dost
thou
strive
against
him?
for
he
giveth
not
account
of
any
of
his
matters.
033:014
For
God
speaketh
once,
yea
twice,
yet
man
perceiveth
it
not.
033:015
In
a
dream,
in
a
vision
of
the
night,
when
deep
sleep
falleth
upon
men,
in
slumberings
upon
the
bed;
033:016
Then
he
openeth
the
ears
of
men,
and
sealeth
their
instruction,
033:017
That
he
may
withdraw
man
from
his
purpose,
and
hide
pride
from
man.
033:018
He
keepeth
back
his
soul
from
the
pit,
and
his
life
from
perishing
by
the
sword.
033:019
He
is
chastened
also
with
pain
upon
his
bed,
and
the
multitude
of
his
bones
with
strong
pain:
033:020
So
that
his
life
abhorreth
bread,
and
his
soul
dainty
meat.
033:021
His
flesh
is
consumed
away,
that
it
cannot
be
seen;
and
his
bones
that
were
not
seen
stick
out.
033:022
Yea,
his
soul
draweth
near
unto
the
grave,
and
his
life
to
the
destroyers.
033:023
If
there
be
a
messenger
with
him,
an
interpreter,
one
among
a
thousand,
to
shew
unto
man
his
uprightness:
033:024
Then
he
is
gracious
unto
him,
and
saith,
Deliver
him
from
going
down
to
the
pit:
I
have
found
a
ransom.
033:025
His
flesh
shall
be
fresher
than
a
child's:
he
shall
return
to
the
days
of
his
youth:
033:026
He
shall
pray
unto
God,
and
he
will
be
favourable
unto
him:
and
he
shall
see
his
face
with
joy:
for
he
will
render
unto
man
his
righteousness.
033:027
He
looketh
upon
men,
and
if
any
say,
I
have
sinned,
and
perverted
that
which
was
right,
and
it
profited
me
not;
033:028
He
will
deliver
his
soul
from
going
into
the
pit,
and
his
life
shall
see
the
light.
033:029
Lo,
all
these
things
worketh
God
oftentimes
with
man,
033:030
To
bring
back
his
soul
from
the
pit,
to
be
enlightened
with
the
light
of
the
living.
033:031
Mark
well,
O
Job,
hearken
unto
me:
hold
thy
peace,
and
I
will
speak.
033:032
If
thou
hast
anything
to
say,
answer
me:
speak,
for
I
desire
to
justify
thee.
033:033
If
not,
hearken
unto
me:
hold
thy
peace,
and
I
shall
teach
thee
wisdom.
034:001
Furthermore
Elihu
answered
and
said,
034:002
Hear
my
words,
O
ye
wise
men;
and
give
ear
unto
me,
ye
that
have
knowledge.
034:003
For
the
ear
trieth
words,
as
the
mouth
tasteth
meat.
034:004
Let
us
choose
to
us
judgment:
let
us
know
among
ourselves
what
is
good.
034:005
For
Job
hath
said,
I
am
righteous:
and
God
hath
taken
away
my
judgment.
034:006
Should
I
lie
against
my
right?
my
wound
is
incurable
without
transgression.
034:007
What
man
is
like
Job,
who
drinketh
up
scorning
like
water?
034:008
Which
goeth
in
company
with
the
workers
of
iniquity,
and
walketh
with
wicked
men.
034:009
For
he
hath
said,
It
profiteth
a
man
nothing
that
he
should
delight
himself
with
God.
034:010
Therefore
hearken
unto
me
ye
men
of
understanding:
far
be
it
from
God,
that
he
should
do
wickedness;
and
from
the
Almighty,
that
he
should
commit
iniquity.
034:011
For
the
work
of
a
man
shall
he
render
unto
him,
and
cause
every
man
to
find
according
to
his
ways.
034:012
Yea,
surely
God
will
not
do
wickedly,
neither
will
the
Almighty
pervert
judgment.
034:013
Who
hath
given
him
a
charge
over
the
earth?
or
who
hath
disposed
the
whole
world?
034:014
If
he
set
his
heart
upon
man,
if
he
gather
unto
himself
his
spirit
and
his
breath;
034:015
All
flesh
shall
perish
together,
and
man
shall
turn
again
unto
dust.
034:016
If
now
thou
hast
understanding,
hear
this:
hearken
to
the
voice
of
my
words.
034:017
Shall
even
he
that
hateth
right
govern?
and
wilt
thou
condemn
him
that
is
most
just?
034:018
Is
it
fit
to
say
to
a
king,
Thou
art
wicked?
and
to
princes,
Ye
are
ungodly?
034:019
How
much
less
to
him
that
accepteth
not
the
persons
of
princes,
nor
regardeth
the
rich
more
than
the
poor?
for
they
all
are
the
work
of
his
hands.
034:020
In
a
moment
shall
they
die,
and
the
people
shall
be
troubled
at
midnight,
and
pass
away:
and
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
without
hand.
034:021
For
his
eyes
are
upon
the
ways
of
man,
and
he
seeth
all
his
goings.
034:022
There
is
no
darkness,
nor
shadow
of
death,
where
the
workers
of
iniquity
may
hide
themselves.
034:023
For
he
will
not
lay
upon
man
more
than
right;
that
he
should
enter
into
judgment
with
God.
034:024
He
shall
break
in
pieces
mighty
men
without
number,
and
set
others
in
their
stead.
034:025
Therefore
he
knoweth
their
works,
and
he
overturneth
them
in
the
night,
so
that
they
are
destroyed.
034:026
He
striketh
them
as
wicked
men
in
the
open
sight
of
others;
034:027
Because
they
turned
back
from
him,
and
would
not
consider
any
of
his
ways:
034:028
So
that
they
cause
the
cry
of
the
poor
to
come
unto
him,
and
he
heareth
the
cry
of
the
afflicted.
034:029
When
he
giveth
quietness,
who
then
can
make
trouble?
and
when
he
hideth
his
face,
who
then
can
behold
him?
whether
it
be
done
against
a
nation,
or
against
a
man
only:
034:030
That
the
hypocrite
reign
not,
lest
the
people
