be
ensnared.
034:031
Surely
it
is
meet
to
be
said
unto
God,
I
have
borne
chastisement,
I
will
not
offend
any
more:
034:032
That
which
I
see
not
teach
thou
me:
if
I
have
done
iniquity,
I
will
do
no
more.
034:033
Should
it
be
according
to
thy
mind?
he
will
recompense
it,
whether
thou
refuse,
or
whether
thou
choose;
and
not
I:
therefore
speak
what
thou
knowest.
034:034
Let
men
of
understanding
tell
me,
and
let
a
wise
man
hearken
unto
me.
034:035
Job
hath
spoken
without
knowledge,
and
his
words
were
without
wisdom.
034:036
My
desire
is
that
Job
may
be
tried
unto
the
end
because
of
his
answers
for
wicked
men.
034:037
For
he
addeth
rebellion
unto
his
sin,
he
clappeth
his
hands
among
us,
and
multiplieth
his
words
against
God.
035:001
Elihu
spake
moreover,
and
said,
035:002
Thinkest
thou
this
to
be
right,
that
thou
saidst,
My
righteousness
is
more
than
God's?
035:003
For
thou
saidst,
What
advantage
will
it
be
unto
thee?
and,
What
profit
shall
I
have,
if
I
be
cleansed
from
my
sin?
035:004
I
will
answer
thee,
and
thy
companions
with
thee.
035:005
Look
unto
the
heavens,
and
see;
and
behold
the
clouds
which
are
higher
than
thou.
035:006
If
thou
sinnest,
what
doest
thou
against
him?
or
if
thy
transgressions
be
multiplied,
what
doest
thou
unto
him?
035:007
If
thou
be
righteous,
what
givest
thou
him?
or
what
receiveth
he
of
thine
hand?
035:008
Thy
wickedness
may
hurt
a
man
as
thou
art;
and
thy
righteousness
may
profit
the
son
of
man.
035:009
By
reason
of
the
multitude
of
oppressions
they
make
the
oppressed
to
cry:
they
cry
out
by
reason
of
the
arm
of
the
mighty.
035:010
But
none
saith,
Where
is
God
my
maker,
who
giveth
songs
in
the
night;
035:011
Who
teacheth
us
more
than
the
beasts
of
the
earth,
and
maketh
us
wiser
than
the
fowls
of
heaven?
035:012
There
they
cry,
but
none
giveth
answer,
because
of
the
pride
of
evil
men.
035:013
Surely
God
will
not
hear
vanity,
neither
will
the
Almighty
regard
it.
035:014
Although
thou
sayest
thou
shalt
not
see
him,
yet
judgment
is
before
him;
therefore
trust
thou
in
him.
035:015
But
now,
because
it
is
not
so,
he
hath
visited
in
his
anger;
yet
he
knoweth
it
not
in
great
extremity:
035:016
Therefore
doth
Job
open
his
mouth
in
vain;
he
multiplieth
words
without
knowledge.
036:001
Elihu
also
proceeded,
and
said,
036:002
Suffer
me
a
little,
and
I
will
shew
thee
that
I
have
yet
to
speak
on
God's
behalf.
036:003
I
will
fetch
my
knowledge
from
afar,
and
will
ascribe
righteousness
to
my
Maker.
036:004
For
truly
my
words
shall
not
be
false:
he
that
is
perfect
in
knowledge
is
with
thee.
036:005
Behold,
God
is
mighty,
and
despiseth
not
any:
he
is
mighty
in
strength
and
wisdom.
036:006
He
preserveth
not
the
life
of
the
wicked:
but
giveth
right
to
the
poor.
036:007
He
withdraweth
not
his
eyes
from
the
righteous:
but
with
kings
are
they
on
the
throne;
yea,
he
doth
establish
them
for
ever,
and
they
are
exalted.
036:008
And
if
they
be
bound
in
fetters,
and
be
holden
in
cords
of
affliction;
036:009
Then
he
sheweth
them
their
work,
and
their
transgressions
that
they
have
exceeded.
036:010
He
openeth
also
their
ear
to
discipline,
and
commandeth
that
they
return
from
iniquity.
036:011
If
they
obey
and
serve
him,
they
shall
spend
their
days
in
prosperity,
and
their
years
in
pleasures.
036:012
But
if
they
obey
not,
they
shall
perish
by
the
sword,
and
they
shall
die
without
knowledge.
036:013
But
the
hypocrites
in
heart
heap
up
wrath:
they
cry
not
when
he
bindeth
them.
036:014
They
die
in
youth,
and
their
life
is
among
the
unclean.
036:015
He
delivereth
the
poor
in
his
affliction,
and
openeth
their
ears
in
oppression.
036:016
Even
so
would
he
have
removed
thee
out
of
the
strait
into
a
broad
place,
where
there
is
no
straitness;
and
that
which
should
be
set
on
thy
table
should
be
full
of
fatness.
036:017
But
thou
hast
fulfilled
the
judgment
of
the
wicked:
judgment
and
justice
take
hold
on
thee.
036:018
Because
there
is
wrath,
beware
lest
he
take
thee
away
with
his
stroke:
then
a
great
ransom
cannot
deliver
thee.
036:019
Will
he
esteem
thy
riches?
no,
not
gold,
nor
all
the
forces
of
strength.
036:020
Desire
not
the
night,
when
people
are
cut
off
in
their
place.
036:021
Take
heed,
regard
not
iniquity:
for
this
hast
thou
chosen
rather
than
affliction.
036:022
Behold,
God
exalteth
by
his
power:
who
teacheth
like
him?
036:023
Who
hath
enjoined
him
his
way?
or
who
can
say,
Thou
hast
wrought
iniquity?
036:024
Remember
that
thou
magnify
his
work,
which
men
behold.
036:025
Every
man
may
see
it;
man
may
behold
it
afar
off.
036:026
Behold,
God
is
great,
and
we
know
him
not,
neither
can
the
number
of
his
years
be
searched
out.
036:027
For
he
maketh
small
the
drops
of
water:
they
pour
down
rain
according
to
the
vapour
thereof:
036:028
Which
the
clouds
do
drop
and
distil
upon
man
abundantly.
036:029
Also
can
any
understand
the
spreadings
of
the
clouds,
or
the
noise
of
his
tabernacle?
036:030
Behold,
he
spreadeth
his
light
upon
it,
and
covereth
the
bottom
of
the
sea.
036:031
For
by
them
judgeth
he
the
people;
he
giveth
meat
in
abundance.
036:032
With
clouds
he
covereth
the
light;
and
commandeth
it
not
to
shine
by
the
cloud
that
cometh
betwixt.
036:033
The
noise
thereof
sheweth
concerning
it,
the
cattle
also
concerning
the
vapour.
037:001
At
this
also
my
heart
trembleth,
and
is
moved
out
of
his
place.
037:002
Hear
attentively
the
noise
of
his
voice,
and
the
sound
that
goeth
out
of
his
mouth.
037:003
He
directeth
it
under
the
whole
heaven,
and
his
lightning
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth.
037:004
After
it
a
voice
roareth:
he
thundereth
with
the
voice
of
his
excellency;
and
he
will
not
stay
them
when
his
voice
is
heard.
037:005
God
thundereth
marvellously
with
his
voice;
great
things
doeth
he,
which
we
cannot
comprehend.
037:006
For
he
saith
to
the
snow,
Be
thou
on
the
earth;
likewise
to
the
small
rain,
and
to
the
great
rain
of
his
strength.
037:007
He
sealeth
up
the
hand
of
every
man;
that
all
men
may
know
his
work.
037:008
Then
the
beasts
go
into
dens,
and
remain
in
their
places.
037:009
Out
of
the
south
cometh
the
whirlwind:
and
cold
out
of
the
north.
037:010
By
the
breath
of
God
frost
is
given:
and
the
breadth
of
the
waters
is
straitened.
037:011
Also
by
watering
he
wearieth
the
thick
cloud:
he
scattereth
his
bright
cloud:
037:012
And
it
is
turned
round
about
by
his
counsels:
that
they
may
do
whatsoever
he
commandeth
them
upon
the
face
of
the
world
in
the
earth.
037:013
He
causeth
it
to
come,
whether
for
correction,
or
for
his
land,
or
for
mercy.
037:014
Hearken
unto
this,
O
Job:
stand
still,
and
consider
the
wondrous
works
of
God.
037:015
Dost
thou
know
when
God
disposed
them,
and
caused
the
light
of
his
cloud
to
shine?
037:016
Dost
thou
know
the
balancings
of
the
clouds,
the
wondrous
works
of
him
which
is
perfect
in
knowledge?
037:017
How
thy
garments
are
warm,
when
he
quieteth
the
earth
by
the
south
wind?
037:018
Hast
thou
with
him
spread
out
the
sky,
which
is
strong,
and
as
a
molten
looking
glass?
037:019
Teach
us
what
we
shall
say
unto
him;
for
we
cannot
order
our
speech
by
reason
of
darkness.
037:020
Shall
it
be
told
him
that
I
speak?
if
a
man
speak,
surely
he
shall
be
swallowed
up.
037:021
And
now
men
see
not
the
bright
light
which
is
in
the
clouds:
but
the
wind
passeth,
and
cleanseth
them.
037:022
Fair
weather
cometh
out
of
the
north:
with
God
is
terrible
majesty.
037:023
Touching
the
Almighty,
we
cannot
find
him
out:
he
is
excellent
in
power,
and
in
judgment,
and
in
plenty
of
justice:
he
will
not
afflict.
037:024
Men
do
therefore
fear
him:
he
respecteth
not
any
that
are
wise
of
heart.
038:001
Then
the
LORD
answered
Job
out
of
the
whirlwind,
and
said,
038:002
Who
is
this
that
darkeneth
counsel
by
words
without
knowledge?
038:003
Gird
up
now
thy
loins
like
a
man;
for
I
will
demand
of
thee,
and
answer
thou
me.
038:004
Where
wast
thou
when
I
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth?
declare,
if
thou
hast
understanding.
038:005
Who
hath
laid
the
measures
thereof,
if
thou
knowest?
or
who
hath
stretched
the
line
upon
it?
038:006
Whereupon
are
the
foundations
thereof
fastened?
or
who
laid
the
corner
stone
thereof;
038:007
When
the
morning
stars
sang
together,
and
all
the
sons
of
God
shouted
for
joy?
038:008
Or
who
shut
up
the
sea
with
doors,
when
it
brake
forth,
as
if
it
had
issued
out
of
the
womb?
038:009
When
I
made
the
cloud
the
garment
thereof,
and
thick
darkness
a
swaddlingband
for
it,
038:010
And
brake
up
for
it
my
decreed
place,
and
set
bars
and
doors,
038:011
And
said,
Hitherto
shalt
thou
come,
but
no
further:
and
here
shall
thy
proud
waves
be
stayed?
038:012
Hast
thou
commanded
the
morning
since
thy
days;
and
caused
the
dayspring
to
know
his
place;
038:013
That
it
might
take
hold
of
the
ends
of
the
earth,
that
the
wicked
might
be
shaken
out
of
it?
038:014
It
is
turned
as
clay
to
the
seal;
and
they
stand
as
a
garment.
038:015
And
from
the
wicked
their
light
is
withholden,
and
the
high
arm
shall
be
broken.
038:016
Hast
thou
entered
into
the
springs
of
the
sea?
or
hast
thou
walked
in
the
search
of
the
depth?
038:017
Have
the
gates
of
death
been
opened
unto
thee?
or
hast
thou
seen
the
doors
of
the
shadow
of
death?
038:018
Hast
thou
perceived
the
breadth
of
the
earth?
declare
if
thou
knowest
it
all.
038:019
Where
is
the
way
where
light
dwelleth?
and
as
for
darkness,
where
is
the
place
thereof,
038:020
That
thou
shouldest
take
it
to
the
bound
thereof,
and
that
thou
shouldest
know
the
paths
to
the
house
thereof?
038:021
Knowest
thou
it,
because
thou
wast
then
born?
or
because
the
number
of
thy
days
is
great?
038:022
Hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
the
snow?
or
hast
thou
seen
the
treasures
of
the
hail,
038:023
Which
I
have
reserved
against
the
time
of
trouble,
against
the
day
of
battle
and
war?
038:024
By
what
way
is
the
light
parted,
which
scattereth
the
east
wind
upon
the
earth?
038:025
Who
hath
divided
a
watercourse
for
the
overflowing
of
waters,
or
a
way
for
the
lightning
of
thunder;
038:026
To
cause
it
to
rain
on
the
earth,
where
no
man
is;
on
the
wilderness,
wherein
there
is
no
man;
038:027
To
satisfy
the
desolate
and
waste
ground;
and
to
cause
the
bud
of
the
tender
herb
to
spring
forth?
038:028
Hath
the
rain
a
father?
or
who
hath
begotten
the
drops
of
dew?
038:029
Out
of
whose
womb
came
the
ice?
and
the
hoary
frost
of
heaven,
who
hath
gendered
it?
038:030
The
waters
are
hid
as
with
a
stone,
and
the
face
of
the
deep
is
frozen.
038:031
Canst
thou
bind
the
sweet
influences
of
Pleiades,
or
loose
the
bands
of
Orion?
038:032
Canst
thou
bring
forth
Mazzaroth
in
his
season?
or
canst
thou
guide
Arcturus
with
his
sons?
038:033
Knowest
thou
the
ordinances
of
heaven?
canst
thou
set
the
dominion
thereof
in
the
earth?
038:034
Canst
thou
lift
up
thy
voice
to
the
clouds,
that
abundance
of
waters
may
cover
thee?
038:035
Canst
thou
send
lightnings,
that
they
may
go
and
say
unto
thee,
Here
we
are?
038:036
Who
hath
put
wisdom
in
the
inward
parts?
or
who
hath
given
understanding
to
the
heart?
038:037
Who
can
number
the
clouds
in
wisdom?
or
who
can
stay
the
bottles
of
heaven,
038:038
When
the
dust
groweth
into
hardness,
and
the
clods
cleave
fast
together?
038:039
Wilt
thou
hunt
the
prey
for
the
lion?
or
fill
the
appetite
of
the
young
lions,
038:040
When
they
couch
in
their
dens,
and
abide
in
the
covert
to
lie
in
wait?
038:041
Who
provideth
for
the
raven
his
food?
when
his
young
ones
cry
unto
God,
they
wander
for
lack
of
meat.
039:001
Knowest
thou
the
time
when
the
wild
goats
of
the
rock
bring
forth?
or
canst
thou
mark
when
the
hinds
do
calve?
039:002
Canst
thou
number
the
months
that
they
fulfil?
or
knowest
thou
the
time
when
they
bring
forth?
039:003
They
bow
themselves,
they
bring
forth
their
young
ones,
they
cast
out
their
sorrows.
039:004
Their
young
ones
are
in
good
liking,
they
grow
up
with
corn;
they
go
forth,
and
return
not
unto
them.
039:005
Who
hath
sent
out
the
wild
ass
free?
or
who
hath
loosed
the
bands
of
the
wild
ass?
039:006
Whose
house
I
have
made
the
wilderness,
and
the
barren
land
his
dwellings.
039:007
He
scorneth
the
multitude
of
the
city,
neither
regardeth
he
the
crying
of
the
driver.
039:008
The
range
of
the
mountains
is
his
pasture,
and
he
searcheth
after
every
green
thing.
039:009
Will
the
unicorn
be
willing
to
serve
thee,
or
abide
by
thy
crib?
039:010
Canst
thou
bind
the
unicorn
with
his
band
in
the
furrow?
or
will
he
harrow
the
valleys
after
thee?
039:011
Wilt
thou
trust
him,
because
his
strength
is
great?
or
wilt
thou
leave
thy
labour
to
him?
039:012
Wilt
thou
believe
him,
that
he
will
bring
home
thy
seed,
and
gather
it
into
thy
barn?
039:013
Gavest
thou
the
goodly
wings
unto
the
peacocks?
or
wings
and
feathers
unto
the
ostrich?
039:014
Which
leaveth
her
eggs
in
the
earth,
and
warmeth
them
in
dust,
039:015
And
forgetteth
that
the
foot
may
crush
them,
or
that
the
wild
beast
may
break
them.
039:016
She
is
hardened
against
her
young
ones,
as
though
they
were
not
her's:
her
labour
is
in
vain
without
fear;
039:017
Because
God
hath
deprived
her
of
wisdom,
neither
hath
he
imparted
to
her
understanding.
039:018
What
time
she
lifteth
up
herself
on
high,
she
scorneth
the
horse
and
his
rider.
039:019
Hast
thou
given
the
horse
strength?
hast
thou
clothed
his
neck
with
thunder?
039:020
Canst
thou
make
him
afraid
as
a
grasshopper?
the
glory
of
his
nostrils
is
terrible.
039:021
He
paweth
in
the
valley,
and
rejoiceth
in
his
strength:
he
goeth
on
to
meet
the
armed
men.
039:022
He
mocketh
at
fear,
and
is
not
affrighted;
neither
turneth
he
back
from
the
sword.
039:023
The
quiver
rattleth
against
him,
the
glittering
spear
and
the
shield.
039:024
He
swalloweth
the
ground
with
fierceness
and
rage:
neither
believeth
he
that
it
is
the
sound
of
the
trumpet.
039:025
He
saith
among
the
trumpets,
Ha,
ha;
and
he
smelleth
the
battle
afar
off,
the
thunder
of
the
captains,
and
the
shouting.
039:026
Doth
the
hawk
fly
by
thy
wisdom,
and
stretch
her
wings
toward
the
south?
039:027
Doth
the
eagle
mount
up
at
thy
command,
and
make
her
nest
on
high?
039:028
She
dwelleth
and
abideth
on
the
rock,
upon
the
crag
of
the
rock,
and
the
strong
place.
039:029
From
thence
she
seeketh
the
prey,
and
her
eyes
behold
afar
off.
039:030
Her
young
ones
also
suck
up
blood:
and
where
the
slain
are,
there
is
she.
040:001
Moreover
the
LORD
answered
Job,
and
said,
040:002
Shall
he
that
contendeth
with
the
Almighty
instruct
him?
he
that
reproveth
God,
let
him
answer
it.
040:003
Then
Job
answered
the
LORD,
and
said,
040:004
Behold,
I
am
vile;
what
shall
I
answer
thee?
I
will
lay
mine
hand
upon
my
mouth.
040:005
Once
have
I
spoken;
but
I
will
not
answer:
yea,
twice;
but
I
will
proceed
no
further.
040:006
Then
answered
the
LORD
unto
Job
out
of
the
whirlwind,
and
said,
040:007
Gird
up
thy
loins
now
like
a
man:
I
will
demand
of
thee,
and
declare
thou
unto
me.
040:008
Wilt
thou
also
disannul
my
judgment?
wilt
thou
condemn
me,
that
thou
mayest
be
righteous?
040:009
Hast
thou
an
arm
like
God?
or
canst
thou
thunder
with
a
voice
like
him?
040:010
Deck
thyself
now
with
majesty
and
excellency;
and
array
thyself
with
glory
and
beauty.
040:011
Cast
abroad
the
rage
of
thy
wrath:
and
behold
every
one
that
is
proud,
and
abase
him.
040:012
Look
on
every
one
that
is
proud,
and
bring
him
low;
and
tread
down
the
wicked
in
their
place.
040:013
Hide
them
in
the
dust
together;
and
bind
their
faces
in
secret.
040:014
Then
will
I
also
confess
unto
thee
that
thine
own
right
hand
can
save
thee.
040:015
Behold
now
behemoth,
which
I
made
with
thee;
he
eateth
grass
as
an
ox.
040:016
Lo
now,
his
strength
is
in
his
loins,
and
his
force
is
in
the
navel
of
his
belly.
040:017
He
moveth
his
tail
like
a
cedar:
the
sinews
of
his
stones
are
wrapped
together.
040:018
His
bones
are
as
strong
pieces
of
brass;
his
bones
are
like
bars
of
iron.
040:019
He
is
the
chief
of
the
ways
of
God:
he
that
made
him
can
make
his
sword
to
approach
unto
him.
040:020
Surely
the
mountains
bring
him
forth
food,
where
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
play.
040:021
He
lieth
under
the
shady
trees,
in
the
covert
of
the
reed,
and
fens.
040:022
The
shady
trees
cover
him
with
their
shadow;
the
willows
of
the
brook
compass
him
about.
040:023
Behold,
he
drinketh
up
a
river,
and
hasteth
not:
he
trusteth
that
he
can
draw
up
Jordan
into
his
mouth.
040:024
He
taketh
it
with
his
eyes:
his
nose
pierceth
through
snares.
041:001
Canst
thou
draw
out
leviathan
with
an
hook?
or
his
tongue
with
a
cord
which
thou
lettest
down?
041:002
Canst
thou
put
an
hook
into
his
nose?
or
bore
his
jaw
through
with
a
thorn?
041:003
Will
he
make
many
supplications
unto
thee?
will
he
speak
soft
words
unto
thee?
041:004
Will
he
make
a
covenant
with
thee?
wilt
thou
take
him
for
a
servant
for
ever?
041:005
Wilt
thou
play
with
him
as
with
a
bird?
or
wilt
thou
bind
him
for
thy
maidens?
041:006
Shall
the
companions
make
a
banquet
of
him?
shall
they
part
him
among
the
merchants?
041:007
Canst
thou
fill
his
skin
with
barbed
irons?
or
his
head
with
fish
spears?
041:008
Lay
thine
hand
upon
him,
remember
the
battle,
do
no
more.
041:009
Behold,
the
hope
of
him
is
in
vain:
shall
not
one
be
cast
down
even
at
the
sight
of
him?
041:010
None
is
so
fierce
that
dare
stir
him
up:
who
then
is
able
to
stand
before
me?
041:011
Who
hath
prevented
me,
that
I
should
repay
him?
whatsoever
is
under
the
whole
heaven
is
mine.
041:012
I
will
not
conceal
his
parts,
nor
his
power,
nor
his
comely
proportion.
041:013
Who
can
discover
the
face
of
his
garment?
or
who
can
come
to
him
with
his
double
bridle?
041:014
Who
can
open
the
doors
of
his
face?
his
teeth
are
terrible
round
about.
041:015
His
scales
are
his
pride,
shut
up
together
as
with
a
close
seal.
041:016
One
is
so
near
to
another,
that
no
air
can
come
between
them.
041:017
They
are
joined
one
to
another,
they
stick
together,
that
they
cannot
be
sundered.
041:018
By
his
neesings
a
light
doth
shine,
and
his
eyes
are
like
the
eyelids
of
the
morning.
041:019
Out
of
his
mouth
go
burning
lamps,
and
sparks
of
fire
leap
out.
041:020
Out
of
his
nostrils
goeth
smoke,
as
out
of
a
seething
pot
or
caldron.
041:021
His
breath
kindleth
coals,
and
a
flame
goeth
out
of
his
mouth.
041:022
In
his
neck
remaineth
strength,
and
sorrow
is
turned
into
joy
before
him.
041:023
The
flakes
of
his
flesh
are
joined
together:
they
are
firm
in
themselves;
they
cannot
be
moved.
041:024
His
heart
is
as
firm
as
a
stone;
yea,
as
hard
as
a
piece
of
the
nether
millstone.
041:025
When
he
raiseth
up
himself,
the
mighty
are
afraid:
by
reason
of
breakings
they
purify
themselves.
041:026
The
sword
of
him
that
layeth
at
him
cannot
hold:
the
spear,
the
dart,
nor
the
habergeon.
041:027
He
esteemeth
iron
as
straw,
and
brass
as
rotten
wood.
041:028
The
arrow
cannot
make
him
flee:
slingstones
are
turned
with
him
into
stubble.
041:029
Darts
are
counted
as
stubble:
he
laugheth
at
the
shaking
of
a
spear.
041:030
Sharp
stones
are
under
him:
he
spreadeth
sharp
pointed
things
upon
the
mire.
041:031
He
maketh
the
deep
to
boil
like
a
pot:
he
maketh
the
sea
like
a
pot
of
ointment.
041:032
He
maketh
a
path
to
shine
after
him;
one
would
think
the
deep
to
be
hoary.
041:033
Upon
earth
there
is
not
his
like,
who
is
made
without
fear.
041:034
He
beholdeth
all
high
things:
he
is
a
king
over
all
the
children
of
pride.
042:001
Then
Job
answered
the
LORD,
and
said,
042:002
I
know
that
thou
canst
do
every
thing,
and
that
no
thought
can
be
withholden
from
thee.
042:003
Who
is
he
that
hideth
counsel
without
knowledge?
therefore
have
I
uttered
that
I
understood
not;
things
too
wonderful
for
me,
which
I
knew
not.
042:004
Hear,
I
beseech
thee,
and
I
will
speak:
I
will
demand
of
thee,
and
declare
thou
unto
me.
042:005
I
have
heard
of
thee
by
the
hearing
of
the
ear:
but
now
mine
eye
seeth
thee.
042:006
Wherefore
I
abhor
myself,
and
repent
in
dust
and
ashes.
042:007
And
it
was
so,
that
after
the
LORD
had
spoken
these
words
unto
Job,
the
LORD
said
to
Eliphaz
the
Temanite,
My
wrath
is
kindled
against
thee,
and
against
thy
two
friends:
for
ye
have
not
spoken
of
me
the
thing
that
is
right,
as
my
servant
Job
hath.
042:008
Therefore
take
unto
you
now
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams,
and
go
to
my
servant
Job,
and
offer
up
for
yourselves
a
burnt
offering;
and
my
servant
Job
shall
pray
for
you:
for
him
will
I
accept:
lest
I
deal
with
you
after
your
folly,
in
that
ye
have
not
spoken
of
me
the
thing
which
is
right,
like
my
servant
Job.
042:009
So
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
and
Bildad
the
Shuhite
and
Zophar
the
Naamathite
went,
and
did
according
as
the
LORD
commanded
them:
the
LORD
also
accepted
Job.
042:010
And
the
LORD
turned
the
captivity
of
Job,
when
he
prayed
for
his
friends:
also
the
LORD
gave
Job
twice
as
much
as
he
had
before.
042:011
Then
came
there
unto
him
all
his
brethren,
and
all
his
sisters,
and
all
they
that
had
been
of
his
acquaintance
before,
and
did
eat
bread
with
him
in
his
house:
and
they
bemoaned
him,
and
comforted
him
over
all
the
evil
that
the
LORD
had
brought
upon
him:
every
man
also
gave
him
a
piece
of
money,
and
every
one
an
earring
of
gold.
042:012
So
the
LORD
blessed
the
latter
end
of
Job
more
than
his
beginning:
for
he
had
fourteen
thousand
sheep,
and
six
thousand
camels,
and
a
thousand
yoke
of
oxen,
and
a
thousand
she
asses.
042:013
He
had
also
seven
sons
and
three
daughters.
042:014
And
he
called
the
name
of
the
first,
Jemima;
and
the
name
of
the
second,
Kezia;
and
the
name
of
the
third,
Kerenhappuch.
042:015
And
in
all
the
land
were
no
women
found
so
fair
as
the
daughters
of
Job:
and
their
father
gave
them
inheritance
among
their
brethren.
042:016
After
this
lived
Job
an
hundred
and
forty
years,
and
saw
his
sons,
and
his
sons'
sons,
even
four
generations.
042:017
So
Job
died,
being
old
and
full
of
days.
Book
19	Psalms
001:001
Blessed
is
the
man
that
walketh
not
in
the
counsel
of
the
ungodly,
nor
standeth
in
the
way
of
sinners,
nor
sitteth
in
the
seat
of
the
scornful.
001:002
But
his
delight
is
in
the
law
of
the
LORD;
and
in
his
law
doth
he
meditate
day
and
night.
001:003
And
he
shall
be
like
a
tree
planted
by
the
rivers
of
water,
that
bringeth
forth
his
fruit
in
his
season;
his
leaf
also
shall
not
wither;
and
whatsoever
he
doeth
shall
prosper.
001:004
The
ungodly
are
not
so:
but
are
like
the
chaff
which
the
wind
driveth
away.
001:005
Therefore
the
ungodly
shall
not
stand
in
the
judgment,
nor
sinners
in
the
congregation
of
the
righteous.
001:006
For
the
LORD
knoweth
the
way
of
the
righteous:
but
the
way
of
the
ungodly
shall
perish.
002:001
Why
do
the
heathen
rage,
and
the
people
