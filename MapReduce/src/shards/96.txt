imagine
a
vain
thing?
002:002
The
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves,
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
together,
against
the
LORD,
and
against
his
anointed,
saying,
002:003
Let
us
break
their
bands
asunder,
and
cast
away
their
cords
from
us.
002:004
He
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
shall
laugh:
the
LORD
shall
have
them
in
derision.
002:005
Then
shall
he
speak
unto
them
in
his
wrath,
and
vex
them
in
his
sore
displeasure.
002:006
Yet
have
I
set
my
king
upon
my
holy
hill
of
Zion.
002:007
I
will
declare
the
decree:
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
me,
Thou
art
my
Son;
this
day
have
I
begotten
thee.
002:008
Ask
of
me,
and
I
shall
give
thee
the
heathen
for
thine
inheritance,
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
thy
possession.
002:009
Thou
shalt
break
them
with
a
rod
of
iron;
thou
shalt
dash
them
in
pieces
like
a
potter's
vessel.
002:010
Be
wise
now
therefore,
O
ye
kings:
be
instructed,
ye
judges
of
the
earth.
002:011
Serve
the
LORD
with
fear,
and
rejoice
with
trembling.
002:012
Kiss
the
Son,
lest
he
be
angry,
and
ye
perish
from
the
way,
when
his
wrath
is
kindled
but
a
little.
Blessed
are
all
they
that
put
their
trust
in
him.
003:001
Lord,
how
are
they
increased
that
trouble
me!
many
are
they
that
rise
up
against
me.
003:002
Many
there
be
which
say
of
my
soul,
There
is
no
help
for
him
in
God.
Selah.
003:003
But
thou,
O
LORD,
art
a
shield
for
me;
my
glory,
and
the
lifter
up
of
mine
head.
003:004
I
cried
unto
the
LORD
with
my
voice,
and
he
heard
me
out
of
his
holy
hill.
Selah.
003:005
I
laid
me
down
and
slept;
I
awaked;
for
the
LORD
sustained
me.
003:006
I
will
not
be
afraid
of
ten
thousands
of
people,
that
have
set
themselves
against
me
round
about.
003:007
Arise,
O
LORD;
save
me,
O
my
God:
for
thou
hast
smitten
all
mine
enemies
upon
the
cheek
bone;
thou
hast
broken
the
teeth
of
the
ungodly.
003:008
Salvation
belongeth
unto
the
LORD:
thy
blessing
is
upon
thy
people.
Selah.
004:001
Hear
me
when
I
call,
O
God
of
my
righteousness:
thou
hast
enlarged
me
when
I
was
in
distress;
have
mercy
upon
me,
and
hear
my
prayer.
004:002
O
ye
sons
of
men,
how
long
will
ye
turn
my
glory
into
shame?
how
long
will
ye
love
vanity,
and
seek
after
leasing?
Selah.
004:003
But
know
that
the
LORD
hath
set
apart
him
that
is
godly
for
himself:
the
LORD
will
hear
when
I
call
unto
him.
004:004
Stand
in
awe,
and
sin
not:
commune
with
your
own
heart
upon
your
bed,
and
be
still.
Selah.
004:005
Offer
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness,
and
put
your
trust
in
the
LORD.
004:006
There
be
many
that
say,
Who
will
shew
us
any
good?
LORD,
lift
thou
up
the
light
of
thy
countenance
upon
us.
004:007
Thou
hast
put
gladness
in
my
heart,
more
than
in
the
time
that
their
corn
and
their
wine
increased.
004:008
I
will
both
lay
me
down
in
peace,
and
sleep:
for
thou,
LORD,
only
makest
me
dwell
in
safety.
005:001
Give
ear
to
my
words,
O
LORD,
consider
my
meditation.
005:002
Hearken
unto
the
voice
of
my
cry,
my
King,
and
my
God:
for
unto
thee
will
I
pray.
005:003
My
voice
shalt
thou
hear
in
the
morning,
O
LORD;
in
the
morning
will
I
direct
my
prayer
unto
thee,
and
will
look
up.
005:004
For
thou
art
not
a
God
that
hath
pleasure
in
wickedness:
neither
shall
evil
dwell
with
thee.
005:005
The
foolish
shall
not
stand
in
thy
sight:
thou
hatest
all
workers
of
iniquity.
005:006
Thou
shalt
destroy
them
that
speak
leasing:
the
LORD
will
abhor
the
bloody
and
deceitful
man.
005:007
But
as
for
me,
I
will
come
into
thy
house
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mercy:
and
in
thy
fear
will
I
worship
toward
thy
holy
temple.
005:008
Lead
me,
O
LORD,
in
thy
righteousness
because
of
mine
enemies;
make
thy
way
straight
before
my
face.
005:009
For
there
is
no
faithfulness
in
their
mouth;
their
inward
part
is
very
wickedness;
their
throat
is
an
open
sepulchre;
they
flatter
with
their
tongue.
005:010
Destroy
thou
them,
O
God;
let
them
fall
by
their
own
counsels;
cast
them
out
in
the
multitude
of
their
transgressions;
for
they
have
rebelled
against
thee.
005:011
But
let
all
those
that
put
their
trust
in
thee
rejoice:
let
them
ever
shout
for
joy,
because
thou
defendest
them:
let
them
also
that
love
thy
name
be
joyful
in
thee.
005:012
For
thou,
LORD,
wilt
bless
the
righteous;
with
favour
wilt
thou
compass
him
as
with
a
shield.
006:001
O
LORD,
rebuke
me
not
in
thine
anger,
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
displeasure.
006:002
Have
mercy
upon
me,
O
LORD;
for
I
am
weak:
O
LORD,
heal
me;
for
my
bones
are
vexed.
006:003
My
soul
is
also
sore
vexed:
but
thou,
O
LORD,
how
long?
006:004
Return,
O
LORD,
deliver
my
soul:
oh
save
me
for
thy
mercies'
sake.
006:005
For
in
death
there
is
no
remembrance
of
thee:
in
the
grave
who
shall
give
thee
thanks?
006:006
I
am
weary
with
my
groaning;
all
the
night
make
I
my
bed
to
swim;
I
water
my
couch
with
my
tears.
006:007
Mine
eye
is
consumed
because
of
grief;
it
waxeth
old
because
of
all
mine
enemies.
006:008
Depart
from
me,
all
ye
workers
of
iniquity;
for
the
LORD
hath
heard
the
voice
of
my
weeping.
006:009
The
LORD
hath
heard
my
supplication;
the
LORD
will
receive
my
prayer.
006:010
Let
all
mine
enemies
be
ashamed
and
sore
vexed:
let
them
return
and
be
ashamed
suddenly.
007:001
O
LORD
my
God,
in
thee
do
I
put
my
trust:
save
me
from
all
them
that
persecute
me,
and
deliver
me:
007:002
Lest
he
tear
my
soul
like
a
lion,
rending
it
in
pieces,
while
there
is
none
to
deliver.
007:003
O
LORD
my
God,
If
I
have
done
this;
if
there
be
iniquity
in
my
hands;
007:004
If
I
have
rewarded
evil
unto
him
that
was
at
peace
with
me;
(yea,
I
have
delivered
him
that
without
cause
is
mine
enemy:)
007:005
Let
the
enemy
persecute
my
soul,
and
take
it;
yea,
let
him
tread
down
my
life
upon
the
earth,
and
lay
mine
honour
in
the
dust.
Selah.
007:006
Arise,
O
LORD,
in
thine
anger,
lift
up
thyself
because
of
the
rage
of
mine
enemies:
and
awake
for
me
to
the
judgment
that
thou
hast
commanded.
007:007
So
shall
the
congregation
of
the
people
compass
thee
about:
for
their
sakes
therefore
return
thou
on
high.
007:008
The
LORD
shall
judge
the
people:
judge
me,
O
LORD,
according
to
my
righteousness,
and
according
to
mine
integrity
that
is
in
me.
007:009
Oh
let
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
come
to
an
end;
but
establish
the
just:
for
the
righteous
God
trieth
the
hearts
and
reins.
007:010
My
defence
is
of
God,
which
saveth
the
upright
in
heart.
007:011
God
judgeth
the
righteous,
and
God
is
angry
with
the
wicked
every
day.
007:012
If
he
turn
not,
he
will
whet
his
sword;
he
hath
bent
his
bow,
and
made
it
ready.
007:013
He
hath
also
prepared
for
him
the
instruments
of
death;
he
ordaineth
his
arrows
against
the
persecutors.
007:014
Behold,
he
travaileth
with
iniquity,
and
hath
conceived
mischief,
and
brought
forth
falsehood.
007:015
He
made
a
pit,
and
digged
it,
and
is
fallen
into
the
ditch
which
he
made.
007:016
His
mischief
shall
return
upon
his
own
head,
and
his
violent
dealing
shall
come
down
upon
his
own
pate.
007:017
I
will
praise
the
LORD
according
to
his
righteousness:
and
will
sing
praise
to
the
name
of
the
LORD
most
high.
008:001
O
LORD,
our
Lord,
how
excellent
is
thy
name
in
all
the
earth!
who
hast
set
thy
glory
above
the
heavens.
008:002
Out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
and
sucklings
hast
thou
ordained
strength
because
of
thine
enemies,
that
thou
mightest
still
the
enemy
and
the
avenger.
008:003
When
I
consider
thy
heavens,
the
work
of
thy
fingers,
the
moon
and
the
stars,
which
thou
hast
ordained;
008:004
What
is
man,
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him?
and
the
son
of
man,
that
thou
visitest
him?
008:005
For
thou
hast
made
him
a
little
lower
than
the
angels,
and
hast
crowned
him
with
glory
and
honour.
008:006
Thou
madest
him
to
have
dominion
over
the
works
of
thy
hands;
thou
hast
put
all
things
under
his
feet:
008:007
All
sheep
and
oxen,
yea,
and
the
beasts
of
the
field;
008:008
The
fowl
of
the
air,
and
the
fish
of
the
sea,
and
whatsoever
passeth
through
the
paths
of
the
seas.
008:009
O
LORD
our
Lord,
how
excellent
is
thy
name
in
all
the
earth!
009:001
I
will
praise
thee,
O
LORD,
with
my
whole
heart;
I
will
shew
forth
all
thy
marvellous
works.
009:002
I
will
be
glad
and
rejoice
in
thee:
I
will
sing
praise
to
thy
name,
O
thou
most
High.
009:003
When
mine
enemies
are
turned
back,
they
shall
fall
and
perish
at
thy
presence.
009:004
For
thou
hast
maintained
my
right
and
my
cause;
thou
satest
in
the
throne
judging
right.
009:005
Thou
hast
rebuked
the
heathen,
thou
hast
destroyed
the
wicked,
thou
hast
put
out
their
name
for
ever
and
ever.
009:006
O
thou
enemy,
destructions
are
come
to
a
perpetual
end:
and
thou
hast
destroyed
cities;
their
memorial
is
perished
with
them.
009:007
But
the
LORD
shall
endure
for
ever:
he
hath
prepared
his
throne
for
judgment.
009:008
And
he
shall
judge
the
world
in
righteousness,
he
shall
minister
judgment
to
the
people
in
uprightness.
009:009
The
LORD
also
will
be
a
refuge
for
the
oppressed,
a
refuge
in
times
of
trouble.
009:010
And
they
that
know
thy
name
will
put
their
trust
in
thee:
for
thou,
LORD,
hast
not
forsaken
them
that
seek
thee.
009:011
Sing
praises
to
the
LORD,
which
dwelleth
in
Zion:
declare
among
the
people
his
doings.
009:012
When
he
maketh
inquisition
for
blood,
he
remembereth
them:
he
forgetteth
not
the
cry
of
the
humble.
009:013
Have
mercy
upon
me,
O
LORD;
consider
my
trouble
which
I
suffer
of
them
that
hate
me,
thou
that
liftest
me
up
from
the
gates
of
death:
009:014
That
I
may
shew
forth
all
thy
praise
in
the
gates
of
the
daughter
of
Zion:
I
will
rejoice
in
thy
salvation.
009:015
The
heathen
are
sunk
down
in
the
pit
that
they
made:
in
the
net
which
they
hid
is
their
own
foot
taken.
009:016
The
LORD
is
known
by
the
judgment
which
he
executeth:
the
wicked
is
snared
in
the
work
of
his
own
hands.
Higgaion.
Selah.
009:017
The
wicked
shall
be
turned
into
hell,
and
all
the
nations
that
forget
God.
009:018
For
the
needy
shall
not
alway
be
forgotten:
the
expectation
of
the
poor
shall
not
perish
for
ever.
009:019
Arise,
O
LORD;
let
not
man
prevail:
let
the
heathen
be
judged
in
thy
sight.
009:020
Put
them
in
fear,
O
LORD:
that
the
nations
may
know
themselves
to
be
but
men.
Selah.
010:001
Why
standest
thou
afar
off,
O
LORD?
why
hidest
thou
thyself
in
times
of
trouble?
010:002
The
wicked
in
his
pride
doth
persecute
the
poor:
let
them
be
taken
in
the
devices
that
they
have
imagined.
010:003
For
the
wicked
boasteth
of
his
heart's
desire,
and
blesseth
the
covetous,
whom
the
LORD
abhorreth.
010:004
The
wicked,
through
the
pride
of
his
countenance,
will
not
seek
after
God:
God
is
not
in
all
his
thoughts.
010:005
His
ways
are
always
grievous;
thy
judgments
are
far
above
out
of
his
sight:
as
for
all
his
enemies,
he
puffeth
at
them.
010:006
He
hath
said
in
his
heart,
I
shall
not
be
moved:
for
I
shall
never
be
in
adversity.
010:007
His
mouth
is
full
of
cursing
and
deceit
and
fraud:
under
his
tongue
is
mischief
and
vanity.
010:008
He
sitteth
in
the
lurking
places
of
the
villages:
in
the
secret
places
doth
he
murder
the
innocent:
his
eyes
are
privily
set
against
the
poor.
010:009
He
lieth
in
wait
secretly
as
a
lion
in
his
den:
he
lieth
in
wait
to
catch
the
poor:
he
doth
catch
the
poor,
when
he
draweth
him
into
his
net.
010:010
He
croucheth,
and
humbleth
himself,
that
the
poor
may
fall
by
his
strong
ones.
010:011
He
hath
said
in
his
heart,
God
hath
forgotten:
he
hideth
his
face;
he
will
never
see
it.
010:012
Arise,
O
LORD;
O
God,
lift
up
thine
hand:
forget
not
the
humble.
010:013
Wherefore
doth
the
wicked
contemn
God?
he
hath
said
in
his
heart,
Thou
wilt
not
require
it.
010:014
Thou
hast
seen
it;
for
thou
beholdest
mischief
and
spite,
to
requite
it
with
thy
hand:
the
poor
committeth
himself
unto
thee;
thou
art
the
helper
of
the
fatherless.
010:015
Break
thou
the
arm
of
the
wicked
and
the
evil
man:
seek
out
his
wickedness
till
thou
find
none.
010:016
The
LORD
is
King
for
ever
and
ever:
the
heathen
are
perished
out
of
his
land.
010:017
LORD,
thou
hast
heard
the
desire
of
the
humble:
thou
wilt
prepare
their
heart,
thou
wilt
cause
thine
ear
to
hear:
010:018
To
judge
the
fatherless
and
the
oppressed,
that
the
man
of
the
earth
may
no
more
oppress.
011:001
In
the
LORD
put
I
my
trust:
how
say
ye
to
my
soul,
Flee
as
a
bird
to
your
mountain?
011:002
For,
lo,
the
wicked
bend
their
bow,
they
make
ready
their
arrow
upon
the
string,
that
they
may
privily
shoot
at
the
upright
in
heart.
011:003
If
the
foundations
be
destroyed,
what
can
the
righteous
do?
011:004
The
LORD
is
in
his
holy
temple,
the
LORD's
throne
is
in
heaven:
his
eyes
behold,
his
eyelids
try,
the
children
of
men.
011:005
The
LORD
trieth
the
righteous:
but
the
wicked
and
him
that
loveth
violence
his
soul
hateth.
011:006
Upon
the
wicked
he
shall
rain
snares,
fire
and
brimstone,
and
an
horrible
tempest:
this
shall
be
the
portion
of
their
cup.
011:007
For
the
righteous
LORD
loveth
righteousness;
his
countenance
doth
behold
the
upright.
012:001
Help,
LORD;
for
the
godly
man
ceaseth;
for
the
faithful
fail
from
among
the
children
of
men.
012:002
They
speak
vanity
every
one
with
his
neighbour:
with
flattering
lips
and
with
a
double
heart
do
they
speak.
012:003
The
LORD
shall
cut
off
all
flattering
lips,
and
the
tongue
that
speaketh
proud
things:
012:004
Who
have
said,
With
our
tongue
will
we
prevail;
our
lips
are
our
own:
who
is
lord
over
us?
012:005
For
the
oppression
of
the
poor,
for
the
sighing
of
the
needy,
now
will
I
arise,
saith
the
LORD;
I
will
set
him
in
safety
from
him
that
puffeth
at
him.
012:006
The
words
of
the
LORD
are
pure
words:
as
silver
tried
in
a
furnace
of
earth,
purified
seven
times.
012:007
Thou
shalt
keep
them,
O
LORD,
thou
shalt
preserve
them
from
this
generation
for
ever.
012:008
The
wicked
walk
on
every
side,
when
the
vilest
men
are
exalted.
013:001
How
long
wilt
thou
forget
me,
O
LORD?
for
ever?
how
long
wilt
thou
hide
thy
face
from
me?
013:002
How
long
shall
I
take
counsel
in
my
soul,
having
sorrow
in
my
heart
daily?
how
long
shall
mine
enemy
be
exalted
over
me?
013:003
Consider
and
hear
me,
O
LORD
my
God:
lighten
mine
eyes,
lest
I
sleep
the
sleep
of
death;
013:004
Lest
mine
enemy
say,
I
have
prevailed
against
him;
and
those
that
trouble
me
rejoice
when
I
am
moved.
013:005
But
I
have
trusted
in
thy
mercy;
my
heart
shall
rejoice
in
thy
salvation.
013:006
I
will
sing
unto
the
LORD,
because
he
hath
dealt
bountifully
with
me.
014:001
The
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart,
There
is
no
God.
They
are
corrupt,
they
have
done
abominable
works,
there
is
none
that
doeth
good.
014:002
The
LORD
looked
down
from
heaven
upon
the
children
of
men,
to
see
if
there
were
any
that
did
understand,
and
seek
God.
014:003
They
are
all
gone
aside,
they
are
all
together
become
filthy:
there
is
none
that
doeth
good,
no,
not
one.
014:004
Have
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
no
knowledge?
who
eat
up
my
people
as
they
eat
bread,
and
call
not
upon
the
LORD.
014:005
There
were
they
in
great
fear:
for
God
is
in
the
generation
of
the
righteous.
014:006
Ye
have
shamed
the
counsel
of
the
poor,
because
the
LORD
is
his
refuge.
014:007
Oh
that
the
salvation
of
Israel
were
come
out
of
Zion!
when
the
LORD
bringeth
back
the
captivity
of
his
people,
Jacob
shall
rejoice,
and
Israel
shall
be
glad.
015:001
Lord,
who
shall
abide
in
thy
tabernacle?
who
shall
dwell
in
thy
holy
hill?
015:002
He
that
walketh
uprightly,
and
worketh
righteousness,
and
speaketh
the
truth
in
his
heart.
015:003
He
that
backbiteth
not
with
his
tongue,
nor
doeth
evil
to
his
neighbour,
nor
taketh
up
a
reproach
against
his
neighbour.
015:004
In
whose
eyes
a
vile
person
is
contemned;
but
he
honoureth
them
that
fear
the
LORD.
He
that
sweareth
to
his
own
hurt,
and
changeth
not.
015:005
He
that
putteth
not
out
his
money
to
usury,
nor
taketh
reward
against
the
innocent.
He
that
doeth
these
things
shall
never
be
moved.
016:001
Preserve
me,
O
God:
for
in
thee
do
I
put
my
trust.
016:002
O
my
soul,
thou
hast
said
unto
the
LORD,
Thou
art
my
Lord:
my
goodness
extendeth
not
to
thee;
016:003
But
to
the
saints
that
are
in
the
earth,
and
to
the
excellent,
in
whom
is
all
my
delight.
016:004
Their
sorrows
shall
be
multiplied
that
hasten
after
another
god:
their
drink
offerings
of
blood
will
I
not
offer,
nor
take
up
their
names
into
my
lips.
016:005
The
LORD
is
the
portion
of
mine
inheritance
and
of
my
cup:
thou
maintainest
my
lot.
016:006
The
lines
are
fallen
unto
me
in
pleasant
places;
yea,
I
have
a
goodly
heritage.
016:007
I
will
bless
the
LORD,
who
hath
given
me
counsel:
my
reins
also
instruct
me
in
the
night
seasons.
016:008
I
have
set
the
LORD
always
before
me:
because
he
is
at
my
right
hand,
I
shall
not
be
moved.
016:009
Therefore
my
heart
is
glad,
and
my
glory
rejoiceth:
my
flesh
also
shall
rest
in
hope.
016:010
For
thou
wilt
not
leave
my
soul
in
hell;
neither
wilt
thou
suffer
thine
Holy
One
to
see
corruption.
016:011
Thou
wilt
shew
me
the
path
of
life:
in
thy
presence
is
fulness
of
joy;
at
thy
right
hand
there
are
pleasures
for
evermore.
017:001
Hear
the
right,
O
LORD,
attend
unto
my
cry,
give
ear
unto
my
prayer,
that
goeth
not
out
of
feigned
lips.
017:002
Let
my
sentence
come
forth
from
thy
presence;
let
thine
eyes
behold
the
things
that
are
equal.
017:003
Thou
hast
proved
mine
heart;
thou
hast
visited
me
in
the
night;
thou
hast
tried
me,
and
shalt
find
nothing;
I
am
purposed
that
my
mouth
shall
not
transgress.
017:004
Concerning
the
works
of
men,
by
the
word
of
thy
lips
I
have
kept
me
from
the
paths
of
the
destroyer.
017:005
Hold
up
my
goings
in
thy
paths,
that
my
footsteps
slip
not.
017:006
I
have
called
upon
thee,
for
thou
wilt
hear
me,
O
God:
incline
thine
ear
unto
me,
and
hear
my
speech.
017:007
Shew
thy
marvellous
lovingkindness,
O
thou
that
savest
by
thy
right
hand
them
which
put
their
trust
in
thee
from
those
that
rise
up
against
them.
017:008
Keep
me
as
the
apple
of
the
eye,
hide
me
under
the
shadow
of
thy
wings,
017:009
From
the
wicked
that
oppress
me,
from
my
deadly
enemies,
who
compass
me
about.
017:010
They
are
inclosed
in
their
own
fat:
with
their
mouth
they
speak
proudly.
017:011
They
have
now
compassed
us
in
our
steps:
they
have
set
their
eyes
bowing
down
to
the
earth;
017:012
Like
as
a
lion
that
is
greedy
of
his
prey,
and
as
it
were
a
young
lion
lurking
in
secret
places.
017:013
Arise,
O
LORD,
disappoint
him,
cast
him
down:
deliver
my
soul
from
the
wicked,
which
is
thy
sword:
017:014
From
men
which
are
thy
hand,
O
LORD,
from
men
of
the
world,
which
have
their
portion
in
this
life,
and
whose
belly
thou
fillest
with
thy
hid
treasure:
they
are
full
of
children,
and
leave
the
rest
of
their
substance
to
their
babes.
017:015
As
for
me,
I
will
behold
thy
face
in
righteousness:
I
shall
be
satisfied,
when
I
awake,
with
thy
likeness.
018:001
I
will
love
thee,
O
LORD,
my
strength.
018:002
The
LORD
is
my
rock,
and
my
fortress,
and
my
deliverer;
my
God,
my
strength,
in
whom
I
will
trust;
my
buckler,
and
the
horn
of
my
salvation,
and
my
high
tower.
018:003
I
will
call
upon
the
LORD,
who
is
worthy
to
be
praised:
so
shall
I
be
saved
from
mine
enemies.
018:004
The
sorrows
of
death
compassed
me,
and
the
floods
of
ungodly
men
made
me
afraid.
018:005
The
sorrows
of
hell
compassed
me
about:
the
snares
of
death
prevented
me.
018:006
In
my
distress
I
called
upon
the
LORD,
and
cried
unto
my
God:
he
heard
my
voice
out
of
his
temple,
and
my
cry
came
before
him,
even
into
his
ears.
018:007
Then
the
earth
shook
and
trembled;
the
foundations
also
of
the
hills
moved
and
were
shaken,
because
he
was
wroth.
018:008
There
went
up
a
smoke
out
of
his
nostrils,
and
fire
out
of
his
mouth
devoured:
coals
were
kindled
by
it.
018:009
He
bowed
the
heavens
also,
and
came
down:
and
darkness
was
under
his
feet.
018:010
And
he
rode
upon
a
cherub,
and
did
fly:
yea,
he
did
fly
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind.
018:011
He
made
darkness
his
secret
place;
his
pavilion
round
about
him
were
dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
of
the
skies.
018:012
At
the
brightness
that
was
before
him
his
thick
clouds
passed,
hail
stones
and
coals
of
fire.
018:013
The
LORD
also
thundered
in
the
heavens,
and
the
Highest
gave
his
voice;
hail
stones
and
coals
of
fire.
018:014
Yea,
he
sent
out
his
arrows,
and
scattered
them;
and
he
shot
out
lightnings,
and
discomfited
them.
018:015
Then
the
channels
of
waters
were
seen,
and
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
discovered
at
thy
rebuke,
O
LORD,
at
the
blast
of
the
breath
of
thy
nostrils.
018:016
He
sent
from
above,
he
took
me,
he
drew
me
out
of
many
waters.
018:017
He
delivered
me
from
my
strong
enemy,
and
from
them
which
hated
me:
for
they
were
too
strong
for
me.
018:018
They
prevented
me
in
the
day
of
my
calamity:
but
the
LORD
was
my
stay.
018:019
He
brought
me
forth
also
into
a
large
place;
he
delivered
me,
because
he
delighted
in
me.
018:020
The
LORD
rewarded
me
according
to
my
righteousness;
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
hath
he
recompensed
me.
018:021
For
I
have
kept
the
ways
of
the
LORD,
and
have
not
wickedly
departed
from
my
God.
018:022
For
all
his
judgments
were
before
me,
and
I
did
not
put
away
his
statutes
from
me.
018:023
I
was
also
upright
before
him,
and
I
kept
myself
from
mine
iniquity.
018:024
Therefore
hath
the
LORD
recompensed
me
according
to
my
righteousness,
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
in
his
eyesight.
018:025
With
the
merciful
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
merciful;
with
an
upright
man
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
upright;
018:026
With
the
pure
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
pure;
and
with
the
froward
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
froward.
018:027
For
thou
wilt
save
the
afflicted
people;
but
wilt
bring
down
high
looks.
018:028
For
thou
wilt
light
my
candle:
the
LORD
my
God
will
enlighten
my
darkness.
018:029
For
by
thee
I
have
run
through
a
troop;
and
by
my
God
have
I
leaped
over
a
wall.
018:030
As
for
God,
his
way
is
perfect:
the
word
of
the
LORD
is
tried:
he
is
a
buckler
to
all
those
that
trust
in
him.
018:031
For
who
is
God
save
the
LORD?
or
who
is
a
rock
save
our
God?
018:032
It
is
God
that
girdeth
me
with
strength,
and
maketh
my
way
perfect.
018:033
He
maketh
my
feet
like
hinds'
feet,
and
setteth
me
upon
my
high
places.
018:034
He
teacheth
my
hands
to
war,
so
that
a
bow
of
steel
is
broken
by
mine
arms.
018:035
Thou
hast
also
given
me
the
shield
of
thy
salvation:
and
thy
right
hand
hath
