holden
me
up,
and
thy
gentleness
hath
made
me
great.
018:036
Thou
hast
enlarged
my
steps
under
me,
that
my
feet
did
not
slip.
018:037
I
have
pursued
mine
enemies,
and
overtaken
them:
neither
did
I
turn
again
till
they
were
consumed.
018:038
I
have
wounded
them
that
they
were
not
able
to
rise:
they
are
fallen
under
my
feet.
018:039
For
thou
hast
girded
me
with
strength
unto
the
battle:
thou
hast
subdued
under
me
those
that
rose
up
against
me.
018:040
Thou
hast
also
given
me
the
necks
of
mine
enemies;
that
I
might
destroy
them
that
hate
me.
018:041
They
cried,
but
there
was
none
to
save
them:
even
unto
the
LORD,
but
he
answered
them
not.
018:042
Then
did
I
beat
them
small
as
the
dust
before
the
wind:
I
did
cast
them
out
as
the
dirt
in
the
streets.
018:043
Thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
strivings
of
the
people;
and
thou
hast
made
me
the
head
of
the
heathen:
a
people
whom
I
have
not
known
shall
serve
me.
018:044
As
soon
as
they
hear
of
me,
they
shall
obey
me:
the
strangers
shall
submit
themselves
unto
me.
018:045
The
strangers
shall
fade
away,
and
be
afraid
out
of
their
close
places.
018:046
The
LORD
liveth;
and
blessed
be
my
rock;
and
let
the
God
of
my
salvation
be
exalted.
018:047
It
is
God
that
avengeth
me,
and
subdueth
the
people
under
me.
018:048
He
delivereth
me
from
mine
enemies:
yea,
thou
liftest
me
up
above
those
that
rise
up
against
me:
thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
violent
man.
018:049
Therefore
will
I
give
thanks
unto
thee,
O
LORD,
among
the
heathen,
and
sing
praises
unto
thy
name.
018:050
Great
deliverance
giveth
he
to
his
king;
and
sheweth
mercy
to
his
anointed,
to
David,
and
to
his
seed
for
evermore.
019:001
The
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
God;
and
the
firmament
sheweth
his
handywork.
019:002
Day
unto
day
uttereth
speech,
and
night
unto
night
sheweth
knowledge.
019:003
There
is
no
speech
nor
language,
where
their
voice
is
not
heard.
019:004
Their
line
is
gone
out
through
all
the
earth,
and
their
words
to
the
end
of
the
world.
In
them
hath
he
set
a
tabernacle
for
the
sun,
019:005
Which
is
as
a
bridegroom
coming
out
of
his
chamber,
and
rejoiceth
as
a
strong
man
to
run
a
race.
019:006
His
going
forth
is
from
the
end
of
the
heaven,
and
his
circuit
unto
the
ends
of
it:
and
there
is
nothing
hid
from
the
heat
thereof.
019:007
The
law
of
the
LORD
is
perfect,
converting
the
soul:
the
testimony
of
the
LORD
is
sure,
making
wise
the
simple.
019:008
The
statutes
of
the
LORD
are
right,
rejoicing
the
heart:
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
is
pure,
enlightening
the
eyes.
019:009
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
clean,
enduring
for
ever:
the
judgments
of
the
LORD
are
true
and
righteous
altogether.
019:010
More
to
be
desired
are
they
than
gold,
yea,
than
much
fine
gold:
sweeter
also
than
honey
and
the
honeycomb.
019:011
Moreover
by
them
is
thy
servant
warned:
and
in
keeping
of
them
there
is
great
reward.
019:012
Who
can
understand
his
errors?
cleanse
thou
me
from
secret
faults.
019:013
Keep
back
thy
servant
also
from
presumptuous
sins;
let
them
not
have
dominion
over
me:
then
shall
I
be
upright,
and
I
shall
be
innocent
from
the
great
transgression.
019:014
Let
the
words
of
my
mouth,
and
the
meditation
of
my
heart,
be
acceptable
in
thy
sight,
O
LORD,
my
strength,
and
my
redeemer.
020:001
The
LORD
hear
thee
in
the
day
of
trouble;
the
name
of
the
God
of
Jacob
defend
thee;
020:002
Send
thee
help
from
the
sanctuary,
and
strengthen
thee
out
of
Zion;
020:003
Remember
all
thy
offerings,
and
accept
thy
burnt
sacrifice;
Selah.
020:004
Grant
thee
according
to
thine
own
heart,
and
fulfil
all
thy
counsel.
020:005
We
will
rejoice
in
thy
salvation,
and
in
the
name
of
our
God
we
will
set
up
our
banners:
the
LORD
fulfil
all
thy
petitions.
020:006
Now
know
I
that
the
LORD
saveth
his
anointed;
he
will
hear
him
from
his
holy
heaven
with
the
saving
strength
of
his
right
hand.
020:007
Some
trust
in
chariots,
and
some
in
horses:
but
we
will
remember
the
name
of
the
LORD
our
God.
020:008
They
are
brought
down
and
fallen:
but
we
are
risen,
and
stand
upright.
020:009
Save,
LORD:
let
the
king
hear
us
when
we
call.
021:001
The
king
shall
joy
in
thy
strength,
O
LORD;
and
in
thy
salvation
how
greatly
shall
he
rejoice!
021:002
Thou
hast
given
him
his
heart's
desire,
and
hast
not
withholden
the
request
of
his
lips.
Selah.
021:003
For
thou
preventest
him
with
the
blessings
of
goodness:
thou
settest
a
crown
of
pure
gold
on
his
head.
021:004
He
asked
life
of
thee,
and
thou
gavest
it
him,
even
length
of
days
for
ever
and
ever.
021:005
His
glory
is
great
in
thy
salvation:
honour
and
majesty
hast
thou
laid
upon
him.
021:006
For
thou
hast
made
him
most
blessed
for
ever:
thou
hast
made
him
exceeding
glad
with
thy
countenance.
021:007
For
the
king
trusteth
in
the
LORD,
and
through
the
mercy
of
the
most
High
he
shall
not
be
moved.
021:008
Thine
hand
shall
find
out
all
thine
enemies:
thy
right
hand
shall
find
out
those
that
hate
thee.
021:009
Thou
shalt
make
them
as
a
fiery
oven
in
the
time
of
thine
anger:
the
LORD
shall
swallow
them
up
in
his
wrath,
and
the
fire
shall
devour
them.
021:010
Their
fruit
shalt
thou
destroy
from
the
earth,
and
their
seed
from
among
the
children
of
men.
021:011
For
they
intended
evil
against
thee:
they
imagined
a
mischievous
device,
which
they
are
not
able
to
perform.
021:012
Therefore
shalt
thou
make
them
turn
their
back,
when
thou
shalt
make
ready
thine
arrows
upon
thy
strings
against
the
face
of
them.
021:013
Be
thou
exalted,
LORD,
in
thine
own
strength:
so
will
we
sing
and
praise
thy
power.
022:001
My
God,
my
God,
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me?
why
art
thou
so
far
from
helping
me,
and
from
the
words
of
my
roaring?
022:002
O
my
God,
I
cry
in
the
day
time,
but
thou
hearest
not;
and
in
the
night
season,
and
am
not
silent.
022:003
But
thou
art
holy,
O
thou
that
inhabitest
the
praises
of
Israel.
022:004
Our
fathers
trusted
in
thee:
they
trusted,
and
thou
didst
deliver
them.
022:005
They
cried
unto
thee,
and
were
delivered:
they
trusted
in
thee,
and
were
not
confounded.
022:006
But
I
am
a
worm,
and
no
man;
a
reproach
of
men,
and
despised
of
the
people.
022:007
All
they
that
see
me
laugh
me
to
scorn:
they
shoot
out
the
lip,
they
shake
the
head,
saying,
022:008
He
trusted
on
the
LORD
that
he
would
deliver
him:
let
him
deliver
him,
seeing
he
delighted
in
him.
022:009
But
thou
art
he
that
took
me
out
of
the
womb:
thou
didst
make
me
hope
when
I
was
upon
my
mother's
breasts.
022:010
I
was
cast
upon
thee
from
the
womb:
thou
art
my
God
from
my
mother's
belly.
022:011
Be
not
far
from
me;
for
trouble
is
near;
for
there
is
none
to
help.
022:012
Many
bulls
have
compassed
me:
strong
bulls
of
Bashan
have
beset
me
round.
022:013
They
gaped
upon
me
with
their
mouths,
as
a
ravening
and
a
roaring
lion.
022:014
I
am
poured
out
like
water,
and
all
my
bones
are
out
of
joint:
my
heart
is
like
wax;
it
is
melted
in
the
midst
of
my
bowels.
022:015
My
strength
is
dried
up
like
a
potsherd;
and
my
tongue
cleaveth
to
my
jaws;
and
thou
hast
brought
me
into
the
dust
of
death.
022:016
For
dogs
have
compassed
me:
the
assembly
of
the
wicked
have
inclosed
me:
they
pierced
my
hands
and
my
feet.
022:017
I
may
tell
all
my
bones:
they
look
and
stare
upon
me.
022:018
They
part
my
garments
among
them,
and
cast
lots
upon
my
vesture.
022:019
But
be
not
thou
far
from
me,
O
LORD:
O
my
strength,
haste
thee
to
help
me.
022:020
Deliver
my
soul
from
the
sword;
my
darling
from
the
power
of
the
dog.
022:021
Save
me
from
the
lion's
mouth:
for
thou
hast
heard
me
from
the
horns
of
the
unicorns.
022:022
I
will
declare
thy
name
unto
my
brethren:
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
will
I
praise
thee.
022:023
Ye
that
fear
the
LORD,
praise
him;
all
ye
the
seed
of
Jacob,
glorify
him;
and
fear
him,
all
ye
the
seed
of
Israel.
022:024
For
he
hath
not
despised
nor
abhorred
the
affliction
of
the
afflicted;
neither
hath
he
hid
his
face
from
him;
but
when
he
cried
unto
him,
he
heard.
022:025
My
praise
shall
be
of
thee
in
the
great
congregation:
I
will
pay
my
vows
before
them
that
fear
him.
022:026
The
meek
shall
eat
and
be
satisfied:
they
shall
praise
the
LORD
that
seek
him:
your
heart
shall
live
for
ever.
022:027
All
the
ends
of
the
world
shall
remember
and
turn
unto
the
LORD:
and
all
the
kindreds
of
the
nations
shall
worship
before
thee.
022:028
For
the
kingdom
is
the
LORD's:
and
he
is
the
governor
among
the
nations.
022:029
All
they
that
be
fat
upon
earth
shall
eat
and
worship:
all
they
that
go
down
to
the
dust
shall
bow
before
him:
and
none
can
keep
alive
his
own
soul.
022:030
A
seed
shall
serve
him;
it
shall
be
accounted
to
the
Lord
for
a
generation.
022:031
They
shall
come,
and
shall
declare
his
righteousness
unto
a
people
that
shall
be
born,
that
he
hath
done
this.
023:001
The
LORD
is
my
shepherd;
I
shall
not
want.
023:002
He
maketh
me
to
lie
down
in
green
pastures:
he
leadeth
me
beside
the
still
waters.
023:003
He
restoreth
my
soul:
he
leadeth
me
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
for
his
name's
sake.
023:004
Yea,
though
I
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death,
I
will
fear
no
evil:
for
thou
art
with
me;
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
me.
023:005
Thou
preparest
a
table
before
me
in
the
presence
of
mine
enemies:
thou
anointest
my
head
with
oil;
my
cup
runneth
over.
023:006
Surely
goodness
and
mercy
shall
follow
me
all
the
days
of
my
life:
and
I
will
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
for
ever.
024:001
The
earth
is
the
LORD's,
and
the
fulness
thereof;
the
world,
and
they
that
dwell
therein.
024:002
For
he
hath
founded
it
upon
the
seas,
and
established
it
upon
the
floods.
024:003
Who
shall
ascend
into
the
hill
of
the
LORD?
or
who
shall
stand
in
his
holy
place?
024:004
He
that
hath
clean
hands,
and
a
pure
heart;
who
hath
not
lifted
up
his
soul
unto
vanity,
nor
sworn
deceitfully.
024:005
He
shall
receive
the
blessing
from
the
LORD,
and
righteousness
from
the
God
of
his
salvation.
024:006
This
is
the
generation
of
them
that
seek
him,
that
seek
thy
face,
O
Jacob.
Selah.
024:007
Lift
up
your
heads,
O
ye
gates;
and
be
ye
lift
up,
ye
everlasting
doors;
and
the
King
of
glory
shall
come
in.
024:008
Who
is
this
King
of
glory?
The
LORD
strong
and
mighty,
the
LORD
mighty
in
battle.
024:009
Lift
up
your
heads,
O
ye
gates;
even
lift
them
up,
ye
everlasting
doors;
and
the
King
of
glory
shall
come
in.
024:010
Who
is
this
King
of
glory?
The
LORD
of
hosts,
he
is
the
King
of
glory.
Selah.
025:001
Unto
thee,
O
LORD,
do
I
lift
up
my
soul.
025:002
O
my
God,
I
trust
in
thee:
let
me
not
be
ashamed,
let
not
mine
enemies
triumph
over
me.
025:003
Yea,
let
none
that
wait
on
thee
be
ashamed:
let
them
be
ashamed
which
transgress
without
cause.
025:004
Shew
me
thy
ways,
O
LORD;
teach
me
thy
paths.
025:005
Lead
me
in
thy
truth,
and
teach
me:
for
thou
art
the
God
of
my
salvation;
on
thee
do
I
wait
all
the
day.
025:006
Remember,
O
LORD,
thy
tender
mercies
and
thy
lovingkindnesses;
for
they
have
been
ever
of
old.
025:007
Remember
not
the
sins
of
my
youth,
nor
my
transgressions:
according
to
thy
mercy
remember
thou
me
for
thy
goodness'
sake,
O
LORD.
025:008
Good
and
upright
is
the
LORD:
therefore
will
he
teach
sinners
in
the
way.
025:009
The
meek
will
he
guide
in
judgment:
and
the
meek
will
he
teach
his
way.
025:010
All
the
paths
of
the
LORD
are
mercy
and
truth
unto
such
as
keep
his
covenant
and
his
testimonies.
025:011
For
thy
name's
sake,
O
LORD,
pardon
mine
iniquity;
for
it
is
great.
025:012
What
man
is
he
that
feareth
the
LORD?
him
shall
he
teach
in
the
way
that
he
shall
choose.
025:013
His
soul
shall
dwell
at
ease;
and
his
seed
shall
inherit
the
earth.
025:014
The
secret
of
the
LORD
is
with
them
that
fear
him;
and
he
will
shew
them
his
covenant.
025:015
Mine
eyes
are
ever
toward
the
LORD;
for
he
shall
pluck
my
feet
out
of
the
net.
025:016
Turn
thee
unto
me,
and
have
mercy
upon
me;
for
I
am
desolate
and
afflicted.
025:017
The
troubles
of
my
heart
are
enlarged:
O
bring
thou
me
out
of
my
distresses.
025:018
Look
upon
mine
affliction
and
my
pain;
and
forgive
all
my
sins.
025:019
Consider
mine
enemies;
for
they
are
many;
and
they
hate
me
with
cruel
hatred.
025:020
O
keep
my
soul,
and
deliver
me:
let
me
not
be
ashamed;
for
I
put
my
trust
in
thee.
025:021
Let
integrity
and
uprightness
preserve
me;
for
I
wait
on
thee.
025:022
Redeem
Israel,
O
God,
out
of
all
his
troubles.
026:001
Judge
me,
O
LORD;
for
I
have
walked
in
mine
integrity:
I
have
trusted
also
in
the
LORD;
therefore
I
shall
not
slide.
026:002
Examine
me,
O
LORD,
and
prove
me;
try
my
reins
and
my
heart.
026:003
For
thy
lovingkindness
is
before
mine
eyes:
and
I
have
walked
in
thy
truth.
026:004
I
have
not
sat
with
vain
persons,
neither
will
I
go
in
with
dissemblers.
026:005
I
have
hated
the
congregation
of
evil
doers;
and
will
not
sit
with
the
wicked.
026:006
I
will
wash
mine
hands
in
innocency:
so
will
I
compass
thine
altar,
O
LORD:
026:007
That
I
may
publish
with
the
voice
of
thanksgiving,
and
tell
of
all
thy
wondrous
works.
026:008
LORD,
I
have
loved
the
habitation
of
thy
house,
and
the
place
where
thine
honour
dwelleth.
026:009
Gather
not
my
soul
with
sinners,
nor
my
life
with
bloody
men:
026:010
In
whose
hands
is
mischief,
and
their
right
hand
is
full
of
bribes.
026:011
But
as
for
me,
I
will
walk
in
mine
integrity:
redeem
me,
and
be
merciful
unto
me.
026:012
My
foot
standeth
in
an
even
place:
in
the
congregations
will
I
bless
the
LORD.
027:001
The
LORD
is
my
light
and
my
salvation;
whom
shall
I
fear?
the
LORD
is
the
strength
of
my
life;
of
whom
shall
I
be
afraid?
027:002
When
the
wicked,
even
mine
enemies
and
my
foes,
came
upon
me
to
eat
up
my
flesh,
they
stumbled
and
fell.
027:003
Though
an
host
should
encamp
against
me,
my
heart
shall
not
fear:
though
war
should
rise
against
me,
in
this
will
I
be
confident.
027:004
One
thing
have
I
desired
of
the
LORD,
that
will
I
seek
after;
that
I
may
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
all
the
days
of
my
life,
to
behold
the
beauty
of
the
LORD,
and
to
enquire
in
his
temple.
027:005
For
in
the
time
of
trouble
he
shall
hide
me
in
his
pavilion:
in
the
secret
of
his
tabernacle
shall
he
hide
me;
he
shall
set
me
up
upon
a
rock.
027:006
And
now
shall
mine
head
be
lifted
up
above
mine
enemies
round
about
me:
therefore
will
I
offer
in
his
tabernacle
sacrifices
of
joy;
I
will
sing,
yea,
I
will
sing
praises
unto
the
LORD.
027:007
Hear,
O
LORD,
when
I
cry
with
my
voice:
have
mercy
also
upon
me,
and
answer
me.
027:008
When
thou
saidst,
Seek
ye
my
face;
my
heart
said
unto
thee,
Thy
face,
LORD,
will
I
seek.
027:009
Hide
not
thy
face
far
from
me;
put
not
thy
servant
away
in
anger:
thou
hast
been
my
help;
leave
me
not,
neither
forsake
me,
O
God
of
my
salvation.
027:010
When
my
father
and
my
mother
forsake
me,
then
the
LORD
will
take
me
up.
027:011
Teach
me
thy
way,
O
LORD,
and
lead
me
in
a
plain
path,
because
of
mine
enemies.
027:012
Deliver
me
not
over
unto
the
will
of
mine
enemies:
for
false
witnesses
are
risen
up
against
me,
and
such
as
breathe
out
cruelty.
027:013
I
had
fainted,
unless
I
had
believed
to
see
the
goodness
of
the
LORD
in
the
land
of
the
living.
027:014
Wait
on
the
LORD:
be
of
good
courage,
and
he
shall
strengthen
thine
heart:
wait,
I
say,
on
the
LORD.
028:001
Unto
thee
will
I
cry,
O
LORD
my
rock;
be
not
silent
to
me:
lest,
if
thou
be
silent
to
me,
I
become
like
them
that
go
down
into
the
pit.
028:002
Hear
the
voice
of
my
supplications,
when
I
cry
unto
thee,
when
I
lift
up
my
hands
toward
thy
holy
oracle.
028:003
Draw
me
not
away
with
the
wicked,
and
with
the
workers
of
iniquity,
which
speak
peace
to
their
neighbours,
but
mischief
is
in
their
hearts.
028:004
Give
them
according
to
their
deeds,
and
according
to
the
wickedness
of
their
endeavours:
give
them
after
the
work
of
their
hands;
render
to
them
their
desert.
028:005
Because
they
regard
not
the
works
of
the
LORD,
nor
the
operation
of
his
hands,
he
shall
destroy
them,
and
not
build
them
up.
028:006
Blessed
be
the
LORD,
because
he
hath
heard
the
voice
of
my
supplications.
028:007
The
LORD
is
my
strength
and
my
shield;
my
heart
trusted
in
him,
and
I
am
helped:
therefore
my
heart
greatly
rejoiceth;
and
with
my
song
will
I
praise
him.
028:008
The
LORD
is
their
strength,
and
he
is
the
saving
strength
of
his
anointed.
028:009
Save
thy
people,
and
bless
thine
inheritance:
feed
them
also,
and
lift
them
up
for
ever.
029:001
Give
unto
the
LORD,
O
ye
mighty,
give
unto
the
LORD
glory
and
strength.
029:002
Give
unto
the
LORD
the
glory
due
unto
his
name;
worship
the
LORD
in
the
beauty
of
holiness.
029:003
The
voice
of
the
LORD
is
upon
the
waters:
the
God
of
glory
thundereth:
the
LORD
is
upon
many
waters.
029:004
The
voice
of
the
LORD
is
powerful;
the
voice
of
the
LORD
is
full
of
majesty.
029:005
The
voice
of
the
LORD
breaketh
the
cedars;
yea,
the
LORD
breaketh
the
cedars
of
Lebanon.
029:006
He
maketh
them
also
to
skip
like
a
calf;
Lebanon
and
Sirion
like
a
young
unicorn.
029:007
The
voice
of
the
LORD
divideth
the
flames
of
fire.
029:008
The
voice
of
the
LORD
shaketh
the
wilderness;
the
LORD
shaketh
the
wilderness
of
Kadesh.
029:009
The
voice
of
the
LORD
maketh
the
hinds
to
calve,
and
discovereth
the
forests:
and
in
his
temple
doth
every
one
speak
of
his
glory.
029:010
The
LORD
sitteth
upon
the
flood;
yea,
the
LORD
sitteth
King
for
ever.
029:011
The
LORD
will
give
strength
unto
his
people;
the
LORD
will
bless
his
people
with
peace.
030:001
I
will
extol
thee,
O
LORD;
for
thou
hast
lifted
me
up,
and
hast
not
made
my
foes
to
rejoice
over
me.
030:002
O
LORD
my
God,
I
cried
unto
thee,
and
thou
hast
healed
me.
030:003
O
LORD,
thou
hast
brought
up
my
soul
from
the
grave:
thou
hast
kept
me
alive,
that
I
should
not
go
down
to
the
pit.
030:004
Sing
unto
the
LORD,
O
ye
saints
of
his,
and
give
thanks
at
the
remembrance
of
his
holiness.
030:005
For
his
anger
endureth
but
a
moment;
in
his
favour
is
life:
weeping
may
endure
for
a
night,
but
joy
cometh
in
the
morning.
030:006
And
in
my
prosperity
I
said,
I
shall
never
be
moved.
030:007
LORD,
by
thy
favour
thou
hast
made
my
mountain
to
stand
strong:
thou
didst
hide
thy
face,
and
I
was
troubled.
030:008
I
cried
to
thee,
O
LORD;
and
unto
the
LORD
I
made
supplication.
030:009
What
profit
is
there
in
my
blood,
when
I
go
down
to
the
pit?
Shall
the
dust
praise
thee?
shall
it
declare
thy
truth?
030:010
Hear,
O
LORD,
and
have
mercy
upon
me:
LORD,
be
thou
my
helper.
030:011
Thou
hast
turned
for
me
my
mourning
into
dancing:
thou
hast
put
off
my
sackcloth,
and
girded
me
with
gladness;
030:012
To
the
end
that
my
glory
may
sing
praise
to
thee,
and
not
be
silent.
O
LORD
my
God,
I
will
give
thanks
unto
thee
for
ever.
031:001
In
thee,
O
LORD,
do
I
put
my
trust;
let
me
never
be
ashamed:
deliver
me
in
thy
righteousness.
031:002
Bow
down
thine
ear
to
me;
deliver
me
speedily:
be
thou
my
strong
rock,
for
an
house
of
defence
to
save
me.
031:003
For
thou
art
my
rock
and
my
fortress;
therefore
for
thy
name's
sake
lead
me,
and
guide
me.
031:004
Pull
me
out
of
the
net
that
they
have
laid
privily
for
me:
for
thou
art
my
strength.
031:005
Into
thine
hand
I
commit
my
spirit:
thou
hast
redeemed
me,
O
LORD
God
of
truth.
031:006
I
have
hated
them
that
regard
lying
vanities:
but
I
trust
in
the
LORD.
031:007
I
will
be
glad
and
rejoice
in
thy
mercy:
for
thou
hast
considered
my
trouble;
thou
hast
known
my
soul
in
adversities;
031:008
And
hast
not
shut
me
up
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy:
thou
hast
set
my
feet
in
a
large
room.
031:009
Have
mercy
upon
me,
O
LORD,
for
I
am
in
trouble:
mine
eye
is
consumed
with
grief,
yea,
my
soul
and
my
belly.
031:010
For
my
life
is
spent
with
grief,
and
my
years
with
sighing:
my
strength
faileth
because
of
mine
iniquity,
and
my
bones
are
consumed.
031:011
I
was
a
reproach
among
all
mine
enemies,
but
especially
among
my
neighbours,
and
a
fear
to
mine
acquaintance:
they
that
did
see
me
without
fled
from
me.
031:012
I
am
forgotten
as
a
dead
man
out
of
mind:
I
am
like
a
broken
vessel.
031:013
For
I
have
heard
the
slander
of
many:
fear
was
on
every
side:
while
they
took
counsel
together
against
me,
they
devised
to
take
away
my
life.
031:014
But
I
trusted
in
thee,
O
LORD:
I
said,
Thou
art
my
God.
031:015
My
times
are
in
thy
hand:
deliver
me
from
the
hand
of
mine
enemies,
and
from
them
that
persecute
me.
031:016
Make
thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
servant:
save
me
for
thy
mercies'
sake.
031:017
Let
me
not
be
ashamed,
O
LORD;
for
I
have
called
upon
thee:
let
the
wicked
be
ashamed,
and
let
them
be
silent
in
the
grave.
031:018
Let
the
lying
lips
be
put
to
silence;
which
speak
grievous
things
proudly
and
contemptuously
against
the
righteous.
031:019
Oh
how
great
is
thy
goodness,
which
thou
hast
laid
up
for
them
that
fear
thee;
which
thou
hast
wrought
for
them
that
trust
in
thee
before
the
sons
of
men!
031:020
Thou
shalt
hide
them
in
the
secret
of
thy
presence
from
the
pride
of
man:
thou
shalt
keep
them
secretly
in
a
pavilion
from
the
strife
of
tongues.
031:021
Blessed
be
the
LORD:
for
he
hath
shewed
me
his
marvellous
kindness
in
a
strong
city.
031:022
For
I
said
in
my
haste,
I
am
cut
off
from
before
thine
eyes:
nevertheless
thou
heardest
the
voice
of
my
supplications
when
I
cried
unto
thee.
031:023
O
love
the
LORD,
all
ye
his
saints:
for
the
LORD
preserveth
the
faithful,
and
plentifully
rewardeth
the
proud
doer.
031:024
Be
of
good
courage,
and
he
shall
strengthen
your
heart,
all
ye
that
hope
in
the
LORD.
032:001
Blessed
is
he
whose
transgression
is
forgiven,
whose
sin
is
covered.
032:002
Blessed
is
the
man
unto
whom
the
LORD
imputeth
not
iniquity,
and
in
whose
spirit
there
is
no
guile.
032:003
When
I
kept
silence,
my
bones
waxed
old
through
my
roaring
all
the
day
long.
032:004
For
day
and
night
thy
hand
was
heavy
upon
me:
my
moisture
is
turned
into
the
drought
of
summer.
Selah.
032:005
I
acknowledge
my
sin
unto
thee,
and
mine
iniquity
have
I
not
hid.
I
said,
I
will
confess
my
