transgressions
unto
the
LORD;
and
thou
forgavest
the
iniquity
of
my
sin.
Selah.
032:006
For
this
shall
every
one
that
is
godly
pray
unto
thee
in
a
time
when
thou
mayest
be
found:
surely
in
the
floods
of
great
waters
they
shall
not
come
nigh
unto
him.
032:007
Thou
art
my
hiding
place;
thou
shalt
preserve
me
from
trouble;
thou
shalt
compass
me
about
with
songs
of
deliverance.
Selah.
032:008
I
will
instruct
thee
and
teach
thee
in
the
way
which
thou
shalt
go:
I
will
guide
thee
with
mine
eye.
032:009
Be
ye
not
as
the
horse,
or
as
the
mule,
which
have
no
understanding:
whose
mouth
must
be
held
in
with
bit
and
bridle,
lest
they
come
near
unto
thee.
032:010
Many
sorrows
shall
be
to
the
wicked:
but
he
that
trusteth
in
the
LORD,
mercy
shall
compass
him
about.
032:011
Be
glad
in
the
LORD,
and
rejoice,
ye
righteous:
and
shout
for
joy,
all
ye
that
are
upright
in
heart.
033:001
Rejoice
in
the
LORD,
O
ye
righteous:
for
praise
is
comely
for
the
upright.
033:002
Praise
the
LORD
with
harp:
sing
unto
him
with
the
psaltery
and
an
instrument
of
ten
strings.
033:003
Sing
unto
him
a
new
song;
play
skilfully
with
a
loud
noise.
033:004
For
the
word
of
the
LORD
is
right;
and
all
his
works
are
done
in
truth.
033:005
He
loveth
righteousness
and
judgment:
the
earth
is
full
of
the
goodness
of
the
LORD.
033:006
By
the
word
of
the
LORD
were
the
heavens
made;
and
all
the
host
of
them
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth.
033:007
He
gathereth
the
waters
of
the
sea
together
as
an
heap:
he
layeth
up
the
depth
in
storehouses.
033:008
Let
all
the
earth
fear
the
LORD:
let
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
stand
in
awe
of
him.
033:009
For
he
spake,
and
it
was
done;
he
commanded,
and
it
stood
fast.
033:010
The
LORD
bringeth
the
counsel
of
the
heathen
to
nought:
he
maketh
the
devices
of
the
people
of
none
effect.
033:011
The
counsel
of
the
LORD
standeth
for
ever,
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
to
all
generations.
033:012
Blessed
is
the
nation
whose
God
is
the
LORD;
and
the
people
whom
he
hath
chosen
for
his
own
inheritance.
033:013
The
LORD
looketh
from
heaven;
he
beholdeth
all
the
sons
of
men.
033:014
From
the
place
of
his
habitation
he
looketh
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth.
033:015
He
fashioneth
their
hearts
alike;
he
considereth
all
their
works.
033:016
There
is
no
king
saved
by
the
multitude
of
an
host:
a
mighty
man
is
not
delivered
by
much
strength.
033:017
An
horse
is
a
vain
thing
for
safety:
neither
shall
he
deliver
any
by
his
great
strength.
033:018
Behold,
the
eye
of
the
LORD
is
upon
them
that
fear
him,
upon
them
that
hope
in
his
mercy;
033:019
To
deliver
their
soul
from
death,
and
to
keep
them
alive
in
famine.
033:020
Our
soul
waiteth
for
the
LORD:
he
is
our
help
and
our
shield.
033:021
For
our
heart
shall
rejoice
in
him,
because
we
have
trusted
in
his
holy
name.
033:022
Let
thy
mercy,
O
LORD,
be
upon
us,
according
as
we
hope
in
thee.
034:001
I
will
bless
the
LORD
at
all
times:
his
praise
shall
continually
be
in
my
mouth.
034:002
My
soul
shall
make
her
boast
in
the
LORD:
the
humble
shall
hear
thereof,
and
be
glad.
034:003
O
magnify
the
LORD
with
me,
and
let
us
exalt
his
name
together.
034:004
I
sought
the
LORD,
and
he
heard
me,
and
delivered
me
from
all
my
fears.
034:005
They
looked
unto
him,
and
were
lightened:
and
their
faces
were
not
ashamed.
034:006
This
poor
man
cried,
and
the
LORD
heard
him,
and
saved
him
out
of
all
his
troubles.
034:007
The
angel
of
the
LORD
encampeth
round
about
them
that
fear
him,
and
delivereth
them.
034:008
O
taste
and
see
that
the
LORD
is
good:
blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
him.
034:009
O
fear
the
LORD,
ye
his
saints:
for
there
is
no
want
to
them
that
fear
him.
034:010
The
young
lions
do
lack,
and
suffer
hunger:
but
they
that
seek
the
LORD
shall
not
want
any
good
thing.
034:011
Come,
ye
children,
hearken
unto
me:
I
will
teach
you
the
fear
of
the
LORD.
034:012
What
man
is
he
that
desireth
life,
and
loveth
many
days,
that
he
may
see
good?
034:013
Keep
thy
tongue
from
evil,
and
thy
lips
from
speaking
guile.
034:014
Depart
from
evil,
and
do
good;
seek
peace,
and
pursue
it.
034:015
The
eyes
of
the
LORD
are
upon
the
righteous,
and
his
ears
are
open
unto
their
cry.
034:016
The
face
of
the
LORD
is
against
them
that
do
evil,
to
cut
off
the
remembrance
of
them
from
the
earth.
034:017
The
righteous
cry,
and
the
LORD
heareth,
and
delivereth
them
out
of
all
their
troubles.
034:018
The
LORD
is
nigh
unto
them
that
are
of
a
broken
heart;
and
saveth
such
as
be
of
a
contrite
spirit.
034:019
Many
are
the
afflictions
of
the
righteous:
but
the
LORD
delivereth
him
out
of
them
all.
034:020
He
keepeth
all
his
bones:
not
one
of
them
is
broken.
034:021
Evil
shall
slay
the
wicked:
and
they
that
hate
the
righteous
shall
be
desolate.
034:022
The
LORD
redeemeth
the
soul
of
his
servants:
and
none
of
them
that
trust
in
him
shall
be
desolate.
035:001
Plead
my
cause,
O
LORD,
with
them
that
strive
with
me:
fight
against
them
that
fight
against
me.
035:002
Take
hold
of
shield
and
buckler,
and
stand
up
for
mine
help.
035:003
Draw
out
also
the
spear,
and
stop
the
way
against
them
that
persecute
me:
say
unto
my
soul,
I
am
thy
salvation.
035:004
Let
them
be
confounded
and
put
to
shame
that
seek
after
my
soul:
let
them
be
turned
back
and
brought
to
confusion
that
devise
my
hurt.
035:005
Let
them
be
as
chaff
before
the
wind:
and
let
the
angel
of
the
LORD
chase
them.
035:006
Let
their
way
be
dark
and
slippery:
and
let
the
angel
of
the
LORD
persecute
them.
035:007
For
without
cause
have
they
hid
for
me
their
net
in
a
pit,
which
without
cause
they
have
digged
for
my
soul.
035:008
Let
destruction
come
upon
him
at
unawares;
and
let
his
net
that
he
hath
hid
catch
himself:
into
that
very
destruction
let
him
fall.
035:009
And
my
soul
shall
be
joyful
in
the
LORD:
it
shall
rejoice
in
his
salvation.
035:010
All
my
bones
shall
say,
LORD,
who
is
like
unto
thee,
which
deliverest
the
poor
from
him
that
is
too
strong
for
him,
yea,
the
poor
and
the
needy
from
him
that
spoileth
him?
035:011
False
witnesses
did
rise
up;
they
laid
to
my
charge
things
that
I
knew
not.
035:012
They
rewarded
me
evil
for
good
to
the
spoiling
of
my
soul.
035:013
But
as
for
me,
when
they
were
sick,
my
clothing
was
sackcloth:
I
humbled
my
soul
with
fasting;
and
my
prayer
returned
into
mine
own
bosom.
035:014
I
behaved
myself
as
though
he
had
been
my
friend
or
brother:
I
bowed
down
heavily,
as
one
that
mourneth
for
his
mother.
035:015
But
in
mine
adversity
they
rejoiced,
and
gathered
themselves
together:
yea,
the
abjects
gathered
themselves
together
against
me,
and
I
knew
it
not;
they
did
tear
me,
and
ceased
not:
035:016
With
hypocritical
mockers
in
feasts,
they
gnashed
upon
me
with
their
teeth.
035:017
Lord,
how
long
wilt
thou
look
on?
rescue
my
soul
from
their
destructions,
my
darling
from
the
lions.
035:018
I
will
give
thee
thanks
in
the
great
congregation:
I
will
praise
thee
among
much
people.
035:019
Let
not
them
that
are
mine
enemies
wrongfully
rejoice
over
me:
neither
let
them
wink
with
the
eye
that
hate
me
without
a
cause.
035:020
For
they
speak
not
peace:
but
they
devise
deceitful
matters
against
them
that
are
quiet
in
the
land.
035:021
Yea,
they
opened
their
mouth
wide
against
me,
and
said,
Aha,
aha,
our
eye
hath
seen
it.
035:022
This
thou
hast
seen,
O
LORD:
keep
not
silence:
O
Lord,
be
not
far
from
me.
035:023
Stir
up
thyself,
and
awake
to
my
judgment,
even
unto
my
cause,
my
God
and
my
Lord.
035:024
Judge
me,
O
LORD
my
God,
according
to
thy
righteousness;
and
let
them
not
rejoice
over
me.
035:025
Let
them
not
say
in
their
hearts,
Ah,
so
would
we
have
it:
let
them
not
say,
We
have
swallowed
him
up.
035:026
Let
them
be
ashamed
and
brought
to
confusion
together
that
rejoice
at
mine
hurt:
let
them
be
clothed
with
shame
and
dishonour
that
magnify
themselves
against
me.
035:027
Let
them
shout
for
joy,
and
be
glad,
that
favour
my
righteous
cause:
yea,
let
them
say
continually,
Let
the
LORD
be
magnified,
which
hath
pleasure
in
the
prosperity
of
his
servant.
035:028
And
my
tongue
shall
speak
of
thy
righteousness
and
of
thy
praise
all
the
day
long.
036:001
The
transgression
of
the
wicked
saith
within
my
heart,
that
there
is
no
fear
of
God
before
his
eyes.
036:002
For
he
flattereth
himself
in
his
own
eyes,
until
his
iniquity
be
found
to
be
hateful.
036:003
The
words
of
his
mouth
are
iniquity
and
deceit:
he
hath
left
off
to
be
wise,
and
to
do
good.
036:004
He
deviseth
mischief
upon
his
bed;
he
setteth
himself
in
a
way
that
is
not
good;
he
abhorreth
not
evil.
036:005
Thy
mercy,
O
LORD,
is
in
the
heavens;
and
thy
faithfulness
reacheth
unto
the
clouds.
036:006
Thy
righteousness
is
like
the
great
mountains;
thy
judgments
are
a
great
deep:
O
LORD,
thou
preservest
man
and
beast.
036:007
How
excellent
is
thy
lovingkindness,
O
God!
therefore
the
children
of
men
put
their
trust
under
the
shadow
of
thy
wings.
036:008
They
shall
be
abundantly
satisfied
with
the
fatness
of
thy
house;
and
thou
shalt
make
them
drink
of
the
river
of
thy
pleasures.
036:009
For
with
thee
is
the
fountain
of
life:
in
thy
light
shall
we
see
light.
036:010
O
continue
thy
lovingkindness
unto
them
that
know
thee;
and
thy
righteousness
to
the
upright
in
heart.
036:011
Let
not
the
foot
of
pride
come
against
me,
and
let
not
the
hand
of
the
wicked
remove
me.
036:012
There
are
the
workers
of
iniquity
fallen:
they
are
cast
down,
and
shall
not
be
able
to
rise.
037:001
Fret
not
thyself
because
of
evildoers,
neither
be
thou
envious
against
the
workers
of
iniquity.
037:002
For
they
shall
soon
be
cut
down
like
the
grass,
and
wither
as
the
green
herb.
037:003
Trust
in
the
LORD,
and
do
good;
so
shalt
thou
dwell
in
the
land,
and
verily
thou
shalt
be
fed.
037:004
Delight
thyself
also
in
the
LORD:
and
he
shall
give
thee
the
desires
of
thine
heart.
037:005
Commit
thy
way
unto
the
LORD;
trust
also
in
him;
and
he
shall
bring
it
to
pass.
037:006
And
he
shall
bring
forth
thy
righteousness
as
the
light,
and
thy
judgment
as
the
noonday.
037:007
Rest
in
the
LORD,
and
wait
patiently
for
him:
fret
not
thyself
because
of
him
who
prospereth
in
his
way,
because
of
the
man
who
bringeth
wicked
devices
to
pass.
037:008
Cease
from
anger,
and
forsake
wrath:
fret
not
thyself
in
any
wise
to
do
evil.
037:009
For
evildoers
shall
be
cut
off:
but
those
that
wait
upon
the
LORD,
they
shall
inherit
the
earth.
037:010
For
yet
a
little
while,
and
the
wicked
shall
not
be:
yea,
thou
shalt
diligently
consider
his
place,
and
it
shall
not
be.
037:011
But
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth;
and
shall
delight
themselves
in
the
abundance
of
peace.
037:012
The
wicked
plotteth
against
the
just,
and
gnasheth
upon
him
with
his
teeth.
037:013
The
LORD
shall
laugh
at
him:
for
he
seeth
that
his
day
is
coming.
037:014
The
wicked
have
drawn
out
the
sword,
and
have
bent
their
bow,
to
cast
down
the
poor
and
needy,
and
to
slay
such
as
be
of
upright
conversation.
037:015
Their
sword
shall
enter
into
their
own
heart,
and
their
bows
shall
be
broken.
037:016
A
little
that
a
righteous
man
hath
is
better
than
the
riches
of
many
wicked.
037:017
For
the
arms
of
the
wicked
shall
be
broken:
but
the
LORD
upholdeth
the
righteous.
037:018
The
LORD
knoweth
the
days
of
the
upright:
and
their
inheritance
shall
be
for
ever.
037:019
They
shall
not
be
ashamed
in
the
evil
time:
and
in
the
days
of
famine
they
shall
be
satisfied.
037:020
But
the
wicked
shall
perish,
and
the
enemies
of
the
LORD
shall
be
as
the
fat
of
lambs:
they
shall
consume;
into
smoke
shall
they
consume
away.
037:021
The
wicked
borroweth,
and
payeth
not
again:
but
the
righteous
sheweth
mercy,
and
giveth.
037:022
For
such
as
be
blessed
of
him
shall
inherit
the
earth;
and
they
that
be
cursed
of
him
shall
be
cut
off.
037:023
The
steps
of
a
good
man
are
ordered
by
the
LORD:
and
he
delighteth
in
his
way.
037:024
Though
he
fall,
he
shall
not
be
utterly
cast
down:
for
the
LORD
upholdeth
him
with
his
hand.
037:025
I
have
been
young,
and
now
am
old;
yet
have
I
not
seen
the
righteous
forsaken,
nor
his
seed
begging
bread.
037:026
He
is
ever
merciful,
and
lendeth;
and
his
seed
is
blessed.
037:027
Depart
from
evil,
and
do
good;
and
dwell
for
evermore.
037:028
For
the
LORD
loveth
judgment,
and
forsaketh
not
his
saints;
they
are
preserved
for
ever:
but
the
seed
of
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
off.
037:029
The
righteous
shall
inherit
the
land,
and
dwell
therein
for
ever.
037:030
The
mouth
of
the
righteous
speaketh
wisdom,
and
his
tongue
talketh
of
judgment.
037:031
The
law
of
his
God
is
in
his
heart;
none
of
his
steps
shall
slide.
037:032
The
wicked
watcheth
the
righteous,
and
seeketh
to
slay
him.
037:033
The
LORD
will
not
leave
him
in
his
hand,
nor
condemn
him
when
he
is
judged.
037:034
Wait
on
the
LORD,
and
keep
his
way,
and
he
shall
exalt
thee
to
inherit
the
land:
when
the
wicked
are
cut
off,
thou
shalt
see
it.
037:035
I
have
seen
the
wicked
in
great
power,
and
spreading
himself
like
a
green
bay
tree.
037:036
Yet
he
passed
away,
and,
lo,
he
was
not:
yea,
I
sought
him,
but
he
could
not
be
found.
037:037
Mark
the
perfect
man,
and
behold
the
upright:
for
the
end
of
that
man
is
peace.
037:038
But
the
transgressors
shall
be
destroyed
together:
the
end
of
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
off.
037:039
But
the
salvation
of
the
righteous
is
of
the
LORD:
he
is
their
strength
in
the
time
of
trouble.
037:040
And
the
LORD
shall
help
them,
and
deliver
them:
he
shall
deliver
them
from
the
wicked,
and
save
them,
because
they
trust
in
him.
038:001
O
lord,
rebuke
me
not
in
thy
wrath:
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
displeasure.
038:002
For
thine
arrows
stick
fast
in
me,
and
thy
hand
presseth
me
sore.
038:003
There
is
no
soundness
in
my
flesh
because
of
thine
anger;
neither
is
there
any
rest
in
my
bones
because
of
my
sin.
038:004
For
mine
iniquities
are
gone
over
mine
head:
as
an
heavy
burden
they
are
too
heavy
for
me.
038:005
My
wounds
stink
and
are
corrupt
because
of
my
foolishness.
038:006
I
am
troubled;
I
am
bowed
down
greatly;
I
go
mourning
all
the
day
long.
038:007
For
my
loins
are
filled
with
a
loathsome
disease:
and
there
is
no
soundness
in
my
flesh.
038:008
I
am
feeble
and
sore
broken:
I
have
roared
by
reason
of
the
disquietness
of
my
heart.
038:009
Lord,
all
my
desire
is
before
thee;
and
my
groaning
is
not
hid
from
thee.
038:010
My
heart
panteth,
my
strength
faileth
me:
as
for
the
light
of
mine
eyes,
it
also
is
gone
from
me.
038:011
My
lovers
and
my
friends
stand
aloof
from
my
sore;
and
my
kinsmen
stand
afar
off.
038:012
They
also
that
seek
after
my
life
lay
snares
for
me:
and
they
that
seek
my
hurt
speak
mischievous
things,
and
imagine
deceits
all
the
day
long.
038:013
But
I,
as
a
deaf
man,
heard
not;
and
I
was
as
a
dumb
man
that
openeth
not
his
mouth.
038:014
Thus
I
was
as
a
man
that
heareth
not,
and
in
whose
mouth
are
no
reproofs.
038:015
For
in
thee,
O
LORD,
do
I
hope:
thou
wilt
hear,
O
Lord
my
God.
038:016
For
I
said,
Hear
me,
lest
otherwise
they
should
rejoice
over
me:
when
my
foot
slippeth,
they
magnify
themselves
against
me.
038:017
For
I
am
ready
to
halt,
and
my
sorrow
is
continually
before
me.
038:018
For
I
will
declare
mine
iniquity;
I
will
be
sorry
for
my
sin.
038:019
But
mine
enemies
are
lively,
and
they
are
strong:
and
they
that
hate
me
wrongfully
are
multiplied.
038:020
They
also
that
render
evil
for
good
are
mine
adversaries;
because
I
follow
the
thing
that
good
is.
038:021
Forsake
me
not,
O
LORD:
O
my
God,
be
not
far
from
me.
038:022
Make
haste
to
help
me,
O
Lord
my
salvation.
039:001
I
said,
I
will
take
heed
to
my
ways,
that
I
sin
not
with
my
tongue:
I
will
keep
my
mouth
with
a
bridle,
while
the
wicked
is
before
me.
039:002
I
was
dumb
with
silence,
I
held
my
peace,
even
from
good;
and
my
sorrow
was
stirred.
039:003
My
heart
was
hot
within
me,
while
I
was
musing
the
fire
burned:
then
spake
I
with
my
tongue,
039:004
LORD,
make
me
to
know
mine
end,
and
the
measure
of
my
days,
what
it
is:
that
I
may
know
how
frail
I
am.
039:005
Behold,
thou
hast
made
my
days
as
an
handbreadth;
and
mine
age
is
as
nothing
before
thee:
verily
every
man
at
his
best
state
is
altogether
vanity.
Selah.
039:006
Surely
every
man
walketh
in
a
vain
shew:
surely
they
are
disquieted
in
vain:
he
heapeth
up
riches,
and
knoweth
not
who
shall
gather
them.
039:007
And
now,
Lord,
what
wait
I
for?
my
hope
is
in
thee.
039:008
Deliver
me
from
all
my
transgressions:
make
me
not
the
reproach
of
the
foolish.
039:009
I
was
dumb,
I
opened
not
my
mouth;
because
thou
didst
it.
039:010
Remove
thy
stroke
away
from
me:
I
am
consumed
by
the
blow
of
thine
hand.
039:011
When
thou
with
rebukes
dost
correct
man
for
iniquity,
thou
makest
his
beauty
to
consume
away
like
a
moth:
surely
every
man
is
vanity.
Selah.
039:012
Hear
my
prayer,
O
LORD,
and
give
ear
unto
my
cry;
hold
not
thy
peace
at
my
tears:
for
I
am
a
stranger
with
thee,
and
a
sojourner,
as
all
my
fathers
were.
039:013
O
spare
me,
that
I
may
recover
strength,
before
I
go
hence,
and
be
no
more.
040:001
I
waited
patiently
for
the
LORD;
and
he
inclined
unto
me,
and
heard
my
cry.
040:002
He
brought
me
up
also
out
of
an
horrible
pit,
out
of
the
miry
clay,
and
set
my
feet
upon
a
rock,
and
established
my
goings.
040:003
And
he
hath
put
a
new
song
in
my
mouth,
even
praise
unto
our
God:
many
shall
see
it,
and
fear,
and
shall
trust
in
the
LORD.
040:004
Blessed
is
that
man
that
maketh
the
LORD
his
trust,
and
respecteth
not
the
proud,
nor
such
as
turn
aside
to
lies.
040:005
Many,
O
LORD
my
God,
are
thy
wonderful
works
which
thou
hast
done,
and
thy
thoughts
which
are
to
us-ward:
they
cannot
be
reckoned
up
in
order
unto
thee:
if
I
would
declare
and
speak
of
them,
they
are
more
than
can
be
numbered.
040:006
Sacrifice
and
offering
thou
didst
not
desire;
mine
ears
hast
thou
opened:
burnt
offering
and
sin
offering
hast
thou
not
required.
040:007
Then
said
I,
Lo,
I
come:
in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me,
040:008
I
delight
to
do
thy
will,
O
my
God:
yea,
thy
law
is
within
my
heart.
040:009
I
have
preached
righteousness
in
the
great
congregation:
lo,
I
have
not
refrained
my
lips,
O
LORD,
thou
knowest.
040:010
I
have
not
hid
thy
righteousness
within
my
heart;
I
have
declared
thy
faithfulness
and
thy
salvation:
I
have
not
concealed
thy
lovingkindness
and
thy
truth
from
the
great
congregation.
040:011
Withhold
not
thou
thy
tender
mercies
from
me,
O
LORD:
let
thy
lovingkindness
and
thy
truth
continually
preserve
me.
040:012
For
innumerable
evils
have
compassed
me
about:
mine
iniquities
have
taken
hold
upon
me,
so
that
I
am
not
able
to
look
up;
they
are
more
than
the
hairs
of
mine
head:
therefore
my
heart
faileth
me.
040:013
Be
pleased,
O
LORD,
to
deliver
me:
O
LORD,
make
haste
to
help
me.
040:014
Let
them
be
ashamed
and
confounded
together
that
seek
after
my
soul
to
destroy
it;
let
them
be
driven
backward
and
put
to
shame
that
wish
me
evil.
040:015
Let
them
be
desolate
for
a
reward
of
their
shame
that
say
unto
me,
Aha,
aha.
040:016
Let
all
those
that
seek
thee
rejoice
and
be
glad
in
thee:
let
such
as
love
thy
salvation
say
continually,
The
LORD
be
magnified.
040:017
But
I
am
poor
and
needy;
yet
the
Lord
thinketh
upon
me:
thou
art
my
help
and
my
deliverer;
make
no
tarrying,
O
my
God.
041:001
Blessed
is
he
that
considereth
the
poor:
the
LORD
will
deliver
him
in
time
of
trouble.
041:002
The
LORD
will
preserve
him,
and
keep
him
alive;
and
he
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
earth:
and
thou
wilt
not
deliver
him
unto
the
will
of
his
enemies.
041:003
The
LORD
will
strengthen
him
upon
the
bed
of
languishing:
thou
wilt
make
all
his
bed
in
his
sickness.
041:004
I
said,
LORD,
be
merciful
unto
me:
heal
my
soul;
for
I
have
sinned
against
thee.
041:005
Mine
enemies
speak
evil
of
me,
When
shall
he
die,
and
his
name
perish?
041:006
And
if
he
come
to
see
me,
he
speaketh
vanity:
his
heart
gathereth
iniquity
to
itself;
when
he
goeth
abroad,
he
telleth
it.
041:007
All
that
hate
me
whisper
together
against
me:
against
me
do
they
devise
my
hurt.
041:008
An
evil
disease,
say
they,
cleaveth
fast
unto
him:
and
now
that
he
lieth
he
shall
rise
up
no
more.
041:009
Yea,
mine
own
familiar
friend,
in
whom
I
trusted,
which
did
eat
of
my
bread,
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me.
041:010
But
thou,
O
LORD,
be
merciful
unto
me,
and
raise
me
up,
that
I
may
requite
them.
041:011
By
this
I
know
that
thou
favourest
me,
because
mine
enemy
doth
not
triumph
over
me.
041:012
And
as
for
me,
thou
upholdest
me
in
mine
integrity,
and
settest
me
before
thy
face
for
ever.
041:013
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
from
everlasting,
and
to
everlasting.
Amen,
and
Amen.
042:001
As
the
hart
panteth
after
the
water
brooks,
so
panteth
my
soul
after
thee,
O
God.
042:002
My
soul
thirsteth
for
God,
for
the
living
God:
when
shall
I
come
and
appear
before
God?
042:003
My
tears
have
been
my
meat
day
and
night,
while
they
continually
say
unto
me,
Where
is
thy
God?
042:004
When
I
remember
these
things,
I
pour
out
my
soul
in
me:
for
I
had
gone
with
the
multitude,
I
went
with
them
to
the
house
of
God,
with
the
voice
of
joy
and
praise,
with
a
multitude
that
kept
holyday.
042:005
Why
art
thou
cast
down,
O
my
soul?
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
in
me?
hope
thou
in
God:
for
I
shall
yet
praise
him
for
the
help
of
his
countenance.
042:006
O
my
God,
my
soul
is
cast
down
within
me:
therefore
will
I
remember
thee
from
the
land
of
Jordan,
and
of
the
Hermonites,
from
the
hill
Mizar.
042:007
Deep
calleth
unto
deep
at
the
noise
of
thy
waterspouts:
all
thy
waves
and
thy
billows
are
gone
over
me.
042:008
Yet
the
LORD
will
command
his
lovingkindness
in
the
day
time,
and
in
the
night
his
song
shall
be
with
me,
and
my
prayer
unto
the
God
of
my
life.
042:009
I
will
say
unto
God
my
rock,
Why
hast
thou
forgotten
me?
why
go
I
mourning
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
enemy?
042:010
As
with
a
sword
in
my
bones,
mine
enemies
reproach
me;
while
they
say
daily
unto
me,
Where
is
thy
God?
042:011
Why
art
thou
cast
down,
O
my
soul?
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
within
me?
hope
thou
in
God:
for
I
shall
yet
praise
him,
who
is
the
health
of
