my
countenance,
and
my
God.
043:001
Judge
me,
O
God,
and
plead
my
cause
against
an
ungodly
nation:
O
deliver
me
from
the
deceitful
and
unjust
man.
043:002
For
thou
art
the
God
of
my
strength:
why
dost
thou
cast
me
off?
why
go
I
mourning
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
enemy?
043:003
O
send
out
thy
light
and
thy
truth:
let
them
lead
me;
let
them
bring
me
unto
thy
holy
hill,
and
to
thy
tabernacles.
043:004
Then
will
I
go
unto
the
altar
of
God,
unto
God
my
exceeding
joy:
yea,
upon
the
harp
will
I
praise
thee,
O
God
my
God.
043:005
Why
art
thou
cast
down,
O
my
soul?
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
within
me?
hope
in
God:
for
I
shall
yet
praise
him,
who
is
the
health
of
my
countenance,
and
my
God.
044:001
We
have
heard
with
our
ears,
O
God,
our
fathers
have
told
us,
what
work
thou
didst
in
their
days,
in
the
times
of
old.
044:002
How
thou
didst
drive
out
the
heathen
with
thy
hand,
and
plantedst
them;
how
thou
didst
afflict
the
people,
and
cast
them
out.
044:003
For
they
got
not
the
land
in
possession
by
their
own
sword,
neither
did
their
own
arm
save
them:
but
thy
right
hand,
and
thine
arm,
and
the
light
of
thy
countenance,
because
thou
hadst
a
favour
unto
them.
044:004
Thou
art
my
King,
O
God:
command
deliverances
for
Jacob.
044:005
Through
thee
will
we
push
down
our
enemies:
through
thy
name
will
we
tread
them
under
that
rise
up
against
us.
044:006
For
I
will
not
trust
in
my
bow,
neither
shall
my
sword
save
me.
044:007
But
thou
hast
saved
us
from
our
enemies,
and
hast
put
them
to
shame
that
hated
us.
044:008
In
God
we
boast
all
the
day
long,
and
praise
thy
name
for
ever.
Selah.
044:009
But
thou
hast
cast
off,
and
put
us
to
shame;
and
goest
not
forth
with
our
armies.
044:010
Thou
makest
us
to
turn
back
from
the
enemy:
and
they
which
hate
us
spoil
for
themselves.
044:011
Thou
hast
given
us
like
sheep
appointed
for
meat;
and
hast
scattered
us
among
the
heathen.
044:012
Thou
sellest
thy
people
for
nought,
and
dost
not
increase
thy
wealth
by
their
price.
044:013
Thou
makest
us
a
reproach
to
our
neighbours,
a
scorn
and
a
derision
to
them
that
are
round
about
us.
044:014
Thou
makest
us
a
byword
among
the
heathen,
a
shaking
of
the
head
among
the
people.
044:015
My
confusion
is
continually
before
me,
and
the
shame
of
my
face
hath
covered
me,
044:016
For
the
voice
of
him
that
reproacheth
and
blasphemeth;
by
reason
of
the
enemy
and
avenger.
044:017
All
this
is
come
upon
us;
yet
have
we
not
forgotten
thee,
neither
have
we
dealt
falsely
in
thy
covenant.
044:018
Our
heart
is
not
turned
back,
neither
have
our
steps
declined
from
thy
way;
044:019
Though
thou
hast
sore
broken
us
in
the
place
of
dragons,
and
covered
us
with
the
shadow
of
death.
044:020
If
we
have
forgotten
the
name
of
our
God,
or
stretched
out
our
hands
to
a
strange
god;
044:021
Shall
not
God
search
this
out?
for
he
knoweth
the
secrets
of
the
heart.
044:022
Yea,
for
thy
sake
are
we
killed
all
the
day
long;
we
are
counted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter.
044:023
Awake,
why
sleepest
thou,
O
Lord?
arise,
cast
us
not
off
for
ever.
044:024
Wherefore
hidest
thou
thy
face,
and
forgettest
our
affliction
and
our
oppression?
044:025
For
our
soul
is
bowed
down
to
the
dust:
our
belly
cleaveth
unto
the
earth.
044:026
Arise
for
our
help,
and
redeem
us
for
thy
mercies'
sake.
045:001
My
heart
is
inditing
a
good
matter:
I
speak
of
the
things
which
I
have
made
touching
the
king:
my
tongue
is
the
pen
of
a
ready
writer.
045:002
Thou
art
fairer
than
the
children
of
men:
grace
is
poured
into
thy
lips:
therefore
God
hath
blessed
thee
for
ever.
045:003
Gird
thy
sword
upon
thy
thigh,
O
most
mighty,
with
thy
glory
and
thy
majesty.
045:004
And
in
thy
majesty
ride
prosperously
because
of
truth
and
meekness
and
righteousness;
and
thy
right
hand
shall
teach
thee
terrible
things.
045:005
Thine
arrows
are
sharp
in
the
heart
of
the
king's
enemies;
whereby
the
people
fall
under
thee.
045:006
Thy
throne,
O
God,
is
for
ever
and
ever:
the
sceptre
of
thy
kingdom
is
a
right
sceptre.
045:007
Thou
lovest
righteousness,
and
hatest
wickedness:
therefore
God,
thy
God,
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
fellows.
045:008
All
thy
garments
smell
of
myrrh,
and
aloes,
and
cassia,
out
of
the
ivory
palaces,
whereby
they
have
made
thee
glad.
045:009
Kings'
daughters
were
among
thy
honourable
women:
upon
thy
right
hand
did
stand
the
queen
in
gold
of
Ophir.
045:010
Hearken,
O
daughter,
and
consider,
and
incline
thine
ear;
forget
also
thine
own
people,
and
thy
father's
house;
045:011
So
shall
the
king
greatly
desire
thy
beauty:
for
he
is
thy
Lord;
and
worship
thou
him.
045:012
And
the
daughter
of
Tyre
shall
be
there
with
a
gift;
even
the
rich
among
the
people
shall
intreat
thy
favour.
045:013
The
king's
daughter
is
all
glorious
within:
her
clothing
is
of
wrought
gold.
045:014
She
shall
be
brought
unto
the
king
in
raiment
of
needlework:
the
virgins
her
companions
that
follow
her
shall
be
brought
unto
thee.
045:015
With
gladness
and
rejoicing
shall
they
be
brought:
they
shall
enter
into
the
king's
palace.
045:016
Instead
of
thy
fathers
shall
be
thy
children,
whom
thou
mayest
make
princes
in
all
the
earth.
045:017
I
will
make
thy
name
to
be
remembered
in
all
generations:
therefore
shall
the
people
praise
thee
for
ever
and
ever.
046:001
God
is
our
refuge
and
strength,
a
very
present
help
in
trouble.
046:002
Therefore
will
not
we
fear,
though
the
earth
be
removed,
and
though
the
mountains
be
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
sea;
046:003
Though
the
waters
thereof
roar
and
be
troubled,
though
the
mountains
shake
with
the
swelling
thereof.
Selah.
046:004
There
is
a
river,
the
streams
whereof
shall
make
glad
the
city
of
God,
the
holy
place
of
the
tabernacles
of
the
most
High.
046:005
God
is
in
the
midst
of
her;
she
shall
not
be
moved:
God
shall
help
her,
and
that
right
early.
046:006
The
heathen
raged,
the
kingdoms
were
moved:
he
uttered
his
voice,
the
earth
melted.
046:007
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
with
us;
the
God
of
Jacob
is
our
refuge.
Selah.
046:008
Come,
behold
the
works
of
the
LORD,
what
desolations
he
hath
made
in
the
earth.
046:009
He
maketh
wars
to
cease
unto
the
end
of
the
earth;
he
breaketh
the
bow,
and
cutteth
the
spear
in
sunder;
he
burneth
the
chariot
in
the
fire.
046:010
Be
still,
and
know
that
I
am
God:
I
will
be
exalted
among
the
heathen,
I
will
be
exalted
in
the
earth.
046:011
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
with
us;
the
God
of
Jacob
is
our
refuge.
Selah.
047:001
O
clap
your
hands,
all
ye
people;
shout
unto
God
with
the
voice
of
triumph.
047:002
For
the
LORD
most
high
is
terrible;
he
is
a
great
King
over
all
the
earth.
047:003
He
shall
subdue
the
people
under
us,
and
the
nations
under
our
feet.
047:004
He
shall
choose
our
inheritance
for
us,
the
excellency
of
Jacob
whom
he
loved.
Selah.
047:005
God
is
gone
up
with
a
shout,
the
LORD
with
the
sound
of
a
trumpet.
047:006
Sing
praises
to
God,
sing
praises:
sing
praises
unto
our
King,
sing
praises.
047:007
For
God
is
the
King
of
all
the
earth:
sing
ye
praises
with
understanding.
047:008
God
reigneth
over
the
heathen:
God
sitteth
upon
the
throne
of
his
holiness.
047:009
The
princes
of
the
people
are
gathered
together,
even
the
people
of
the
God
of
Abraham:
for
the
shields
of
the
earth
belong
unto
God:
he
is
greatly
exalted.
048:001
Great
is
the
LORD,
and
greatly
to
be
praised
in
the
city
of
our
God,
in
the
mountain
of
his
holiness.
048:002
Beautiful
for
situation,
the
joy
of
the
whole
earth,
is
mount
Zion,
on
the
sides
of
the
north,
the
city
of
the
great
King.
048:003
God
is
known
in
her
palaces
for
a
refuge.
048:004
For,
lo,
the
kings
were
assembled,
they
passed
by
together.
048:005
They
saw
it,
and
so
they
marvelled;
they
were
troubled,
and
hasted
away.
048:006
Fear
took
hold
upon
them
there,
and
pain,
as
of
a
woman
in
travail.
048:007
Thou
breakest
the
ships
of
Tarshish
with
an
east
wind.
048:008
As
we
have
heard,
so
have
we
seen
in
the
city
of
the
LORD
of
hosts,
in
the
city
of
our
God:
God
will
establish
it
for
ever.
Selah.
048:009
We
have
thought
of
thy
lovingkindness,
O
God,
in
the
midst
of
thy
temple.
048:010
According
to
thy
name,
O
God,
so
is
thy
praise
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth:
thy
right
hand
is
full
of
righteousness.
048:011
Let
mount
Zion
rejoice,
let
the
daughters
of
Judah
be
glad,
because
of
thy
judgments.
048:012
Walk
about
Zion,
and
go
round
about
her:
tell
the
towers
thereof.
048:013
Mark
ye
well
her
bulwarks,
consider
her
palaces;
that
ye
may
tell
it
to
the
generation
following.
048:014
For
this
God
is
our
God
for
ever
and
ever:
he
will
be
our
guide
even
unto
death.
049:001
Hear
this,
all
ye
people;
give
ear,
all
ye
inhabitants
of
the
world:
049:002
Both
low
and
high,
rich
and
poor,
together.
049:003
My
mouth
shall
speak
of
wisdom;
and
the
meditation
of
my
heart
shall
be
of
understanding.
049:004
I
will
incline
mine
ear
to
a
parable:
I
will
open
my
dark
saying
upon
the
harp.
049:005
Wherefore
should
I
fear
in
the
days
of
evil,
when
the
iniquity
of
my
heels
shall
compass
me
about?
049:006
They
that
trust
in
their
wealth,
and
boast
themselves
in
the
multitude
of
their
riches;
049:007
None
of
them
can
by
any
means
redeem
his
brother,
nor
give
to
God
a
ransom
for
him:
049:008
(For
the
redemption
of
their
soul
is
precious,
and
it
ceaseth
for
ever:)
049:009
That
he
should
still
live
for
ever,
and
not
see
corruption.
049:010
For
he
seeth
that
wise
men
die,
likewise
the
fool
and
the
brutish
person
perish,
and
leave
their
wealth
to
others.
049:011
Their
inward
thought
is,
that
their
houses
shall
continue
for
ever,
and
their
dwelling
places
to
all
generations;
they
call
their
lands
after
their
own
names.
049:012
Nevertheless
man
being
in
honour
abideth
not:
he
is
like
the
beasts
that
perish.
049:013
This
their
way
is
their
folly:
yet
their
posterity
approve
their
sayings.
Selah.
049:014
Like
sheep
they
are
laid
in
the
grave;
death
shall
feed
on
them;
and
the
upright
shall
have
dominion
over
them
in
the
morning;
and
their
beauty
shall
consume
in
the
grave
from
their
dwelling.
049:015
But
God
will
redeem
my
soul
from
the
power
of
the
grave:
for
he
shall
receive
me.
Selah.
049:016
Be
not
thou
afraid
when
one
is
made
rich,
when
the
glory
of
his
house
is
increased;
049:017
For
when
he
dieth
he
shall
carry
nothing
away:
his
glory
shall
not
descend
after
him.
049:018
Though
while
he
lived
he
blessed
his
soul:
and
men
will
praise
thee,
when
thou
doest
well
to
thyself.
049:019
He
shall
go
to
the
generation
of
his
fathers;
they
shall
never
see
light.
049:020
Man
that
is
in
honour,
and
understandeth
not,
is
like
the
beasts
that
perish.
050:001
The
mighty
God,
even
the
LORD,
hath
spoken,
and
called
the
earth
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
unto
the
going
down
thereof.
050:002
Out
of
Zion,
the
perfection
of
beauty,
God
hath
shined.
050:003
Our
God
shall
come,
and
shall
not
keep
silence:
a
fire
shall
devour
before
him,
and
it
shall
be
very
tempestuous
round
about
him.
050:004
He
shall
call
to
the
heavens
from
above,
and
to
the
earth,
that
he
may
judge
his
people.
050:005
Gather
my
saints
together
unto
me;
those
that
have
made
a
covenant
with
me
by
sacrifice.
050:006
And
the
heavens
shall
declare
his
righteousness:
for
God
is
judge
himself.
Selah.
050:007
Hear,
O
my
people,
and
I
will
speak;
O
Israel,
and
I
will
testify
against
thee:
I
am
God,
even
thy
God.
050:008
I
will
not
reprove
thee
for
thy
sacrifices
or
thy
burnt
offerings,
to
have
been
continually
before
me.
050:009
I
will
take
no
bullock
out
of
thy
house,
nor
he
goats
out
of
thy
folds.
050:010
For
every
beast
of
the
forest
is
mine,
and
the
cattle
upon
a
thousand
hills.
050:011
I
know
all
the
fowls
of
the
mountains:
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
are
mine.
050:012
If
I
were
hungry,
I
would
not
tell
thee:
for
the
world
is
mine,
and
the
fulness
thereof.
050:013
Will
I
eat
the
flesh
of
bulls,
or
drink
the
blood
of
goats?
050:014
Offer
unto
God
thanksgiving;
and
pay
thy
vows
unto
the
most
High:
050:015
And
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble:
I
will
deliver
thee,
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me.
050:016
But
unto
the
wicked
God
saith,
What
hast
thou
to
do
to
declare
my
statutes,
or
that
thou
shouldest
take
my
covenant
in
thy
mouth?
050:017
Seeing
thou
hatest
instruction,
and
casteth
my
words
behind
thee.
050:018
When
thou
sawest
a
thief,
then
thou
consentedst
with
him,
and
hast
been
partaker
with
adulterers.
050:019
Thou
givest
thy
mouth
to
evil,
and
thy
tongue
frameth
deceit.
050:020
Thou
sittest
and
speakest
against
thy
brother;
thou
slanderest
thine
own
mother's
son.
050:021
These
things
hast
thou
done,
and
I
kept
silence;
thou
thoughtest
that
I
was
altogether
such
an
one
as
thyself:
but
I
will
reprove
thee,
and
set
them
in
order
before
thine
eyes.
050:022
Now
consider
this,
ye
that
forget
God,
lest
I
tear
you
in
pieces,
and
there
be
none
to
deliver.
050:023
Whoso
offereth
praise
glorifieth
me:
and
to
him
that
ordereth
his
conversation
aright
will
I
shew
the
salvation
of
God.
051:001
Have
mercy
upon
me,
O
God,
according
to
thy
lovingkindness:
according
unto
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies
blot
out
my
transgressions.
051:002
Wash
me
throughly
from
mine
iniquity,
and
cleanse
me
from
my
sin.
051:003
For
I
acknowledge
my
transgressions:
and
my
sin
is
ever
before
me.
051:004
Against
thee,
thee
only,
have
I
sinned,
and
done
this
evil
in
thy
sight:
that
thou
mightest
be
justified
when
thou
speakest,
and
be
clear
when
thou
judgest.
051:005
Behold,
I
was
shapen
in
iniquity;
and
in
sin
did
my
mother
conceive
me.
051:006
Behold,
thou
desirest
truth
in
the
inward
parts:
and
in
the
hidden
part
thou
shalt
make
me
to
know
wisdom.
051:007
Purge
me
with
hyssop,
and
I
shall
be
clean:
wash
me,
and
I
shall
be
whiter
than
snow.
051:008
Make
me
to
hear
joy
and
gladness;
that
the
bones
which
thou
hast
broken
may
rejoice.
051:009
Hide
thy
face
from
my
sins,
and
blot
out
all
mine
iniquities.
051:010
Create
in
me
a
clean
heart,
O
God;
and
renew
a
right
spirit
within
me.
051:011
Cast
me
not
away
from
thy
presence;
and
take
not
thy
holy
spirit
from
me.
051:012
Restore
unto
me
the
joy
of
thy
salvation;
and
uphold
me
with
thy
free
spirit.
051:013
Then
will
I
teach
transgressors
thy
ways;
and
sinners
shall
be
converted
unto
thee.
051:014
Deliver
me
from
bloodguiltiness,
O
God,
thou
God
of
my
salvation:
and
my
tongue
shall
sing
aloud
of
thy
righteousness.
051:015
O
Lord,
open
thou
my
lips;
and
my
mouth
shall
shew
forth
thy
praise.
051:016
For
thou
desirest
not
sacrifice;
else
would
I
give
it:
thou
delightest
not
in
burnt
offering.
051:017
The
sacrifices
of
God
are
a
broken
spirit:
a
broken
and
a
contrite
heart,
O
God,
thou
wilt
not
despise.
051:018
Do
good
in
thy
good
pleasure
unto
Zion:
build
thou
the
walls
of
Jerusalem.
051:019
Then
shalt
thou
be
pleased
with
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness,
with
burnt
offering
and
whole
burnt
offering:
then
shall
they
offer
bullocks
upon
thine
altar.
052:001
Why
boastest
thou
thyself
in
mischief,
O
mighty
man?
the
goodness
of
God
endureth
continually.
052:002
The
tongue
deviseth
mischiefs;
like
a
sharp
razor,
working
deceitfully.
052:003
Thou
lovest
evil
more
than
good;
and
lying
rather
than
to
speak
righteousness.
Selah.
052:004
Thou
lovest
all
devouring
words,
O
thou
deceitful
tongue.
052:005
God
shall
likewise
destroy
thee
for
ever,
he
shall
take
thee
away,
and
pluck
thee
out
of
thy
dwelling
place,
and
root
thee
out
of
the
land
of
the
living.
Selah.
052:006
The
righteous
also
shall
see,
and
fear,
and
shall
laugh
at
him:
052:007
Lo,
this
is
the
man
that
made
not
God
his
strength;
but
trusted
in
the
abundance
of
his
riches,
and
strengthened
himself
in
his
wickedness.
052:008
But
I
am
like
a
green
olive
tree
in
the
house
of
God:
I
trust
in
the
mercy
of
God
for
ever
and
ever.
052:009
I
will
praise
thee
for
ever,
because
thou
hast
done
it:
and
I
will
wait
on
thy
name;
for
it
is
good
before
thy
saints.
053:001
The
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart,
There
is
no
God.
Corrupt
are
they,
and
have
done
abominable
iniquity:
there
is
none
that
doeth
good.
053:002
God
looked
down
from
heaven
upon
the
children
of
men,
to
see
if
there
were
any
that
did
understand,
that
did
seek
God.
053:003
Every
one
of
them
is
gone
back:
they
are
altogether
become
filthy;
there
is
none
that
doeth
good,
no,
not
one.
053:004
Have
the
workers
of
iniquity
no
knowledge?
who
eat
up
my
people
as
they
eat
bread:
they
have
not
called
upon
God.
053:005
There
were
they
in
great
fear,
where
no
fear
was:
for
God
hath
scattered
the
bones
of
him
that
encampeth
against
thee:
thou
hast
put
them
to
shame,
because
God
hath
despised
them.
053:006
Oh
that
the
salvation
of
Israel
were
come
out
of
Zion!
When
God
bringeth
back
the
captivity
of
his
people,
Jacob
shall
rejoice,
and
Israel
shall
be
glad.
054:001
Save
me,
O
God,
by
thy
name,
and
judge
me
by
thy
strength.
054:002
Hear
my
prayer,
O
God;
give
ear
to
the
words
of
my
mouth.
054:003
For
strangers
are
risen
up
against
me,
and
oppressors
seek
after
my
soul:
they
have
not
set
God
before
them.
Selah.
054:004
Behold,
God
is
mine
helper:
the
Lord
is
with
them
that
uphold
my
soul.
054:005
He
shall
reward
evil
unto
mine
enemies:
cut
them
off
in
thy
truth.
054:006
I
will
freely
sacrifice
unto
thee:
I
will
praise
thy
name,
O
LORD;
for
it
is
good.
054:007
For
he
hath
delivered
me
out
of
all
trouble:
and
mine
eye
hath
seen
his
desire
upon
mine
enemies.
055:001
Give
ear
to
my
prayer,
O
God;
and
hide
not
thyself
from
my
supplication.
055:002
Attend
unto
me,
and
hear
me:
I
mourn
in
my
complaint,
and
make
a
noise;
055:003
Because
of
the
voice
of
the
enemy,
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
wicked:
for
they
cast
iniquity
upon
me,
and
in
wrath
they
hate
me.
055:004
My
heart
is
sore
pained
within
me:
and
the
terrors
of
death
are
fallen
upon
me.
055:005
Fearfulness
and
trembling
are
come
upon
me,
and
horror
hath
overwhelmed
me.
055:006
And
I
said,
Oh
that
I
had
wings
like
a
dove!
for
then
would
I
fly
away,
and
be
at
rest.
055:007
Lo,
then
would
I
wander
far
off,
and
remain
in
the
wilderness.
Selah.
055:008
I
would
hasten
my
escape
from
the
windy
storm
and
tempest.
055:009
Destroy,
O
Lord,
and
divide
their
tongues:
for
I
have
seen
violence
and
strife
in
the
city.
055:010
Day
and
night
they
go
about
it
upon
the
walls
thereof:
mischief
also
and
sorrow
are
in
the
midst
of
it.
055:011
Wickedness
is
in
the
midst
thereof:
deceit
and
guile
depart
not
from
her
streets.
055:012
For
it
was
not
an
enemy
that
reproached
me;
then
I
could
have
borne
it:
neither
was
it
he
that
hated
me
that
did
magnify
himself
against
me;
then
I
would
have
hid
myself
from
him:
055:013
But
it
was
thou,
a
man
mine
equal,
my
guide,
and
mine
acquaintance.
055:014
We
took
sweet
counsel
together,
and
walked
unto
the
house
of
God
in
company.
055:015
Let
death
seize
upon
them,
and
let
them
go
down
quick
into
hell:
for
wickedness
is
in
their
dwellings,
and
among
them.
055:016
As
for
me,
I
will
call
upon
God;
and
the
LORD
shall
save
me.
055:017
Evening,
and
morning,
and
at
noon,
will
I
pray,
and
cry
aloud:
and
he
shall
hear
my
voice.
055:018
He
hath
delivered
my
soul
in
peace
from
the
battle
that
was
against
me:
for
there
were
many
with
me.
055:019
God
shall
hear,
and
afflict
them,
even
he
that
abideth
of
old.
Selah.
Because
they
have
no
changes,
therefore
they
fear
not
God.
055:020
He
hath
put
forth
his
hands
against
such
as
be
at
peace
with
him:
he
hath
broken
his
covenant.
055:021
The
words
of
his
mouth
were
smoother
than
butter,
but
war
was
in
his
heart:
his
words
were
softer
than
oil,
yet
were
they
drawn
swords.
055:022
Cast
thy
burden
upon
the
LORD,
and
he
shall
sustain
thee:
he
shall
never
suffer
the
righteous
to
be
moved.
055:023
But
thou,
O
God,
shalt
bring
them
down
into
the
pit
of
destruction:
bloody
and
deceitful
men
shall
not
live
out
half
their
days;
but
I
will
trust
in
thee.
056:001
Be
merciful
unto
me,
O
God:
for
man
would
swallow
me
up;
he
fighting
daily
oppresseth
me.
056:002
Mine
enemies
would
daily
swallow
me
up:
for
they
be
many
that
fight
against
me,
O
thou
most
High.
056:003
What
time
I
am
afraid,
I
will
trust
in
thee.
056:004
In
God
I
will
praise
his
word,
in
God
I
have
put
my
trust;
I
will
not
fear
what
flesh
can
do
unto
me.
056:005
Every
day
they
wrest
my
words:
all
their
thoughts
are
against
me
for
evil.
056:006
They
gather
themselves
together,
they
hide
themselves,
they
mark
my
steps,
when
they
wait
for
my
soul.
056:007
Shall
they
escape
by
iniquity?
in
thine
anger
cast
down
the
people,
O
God.
056:008
Thou
tellest
my
wanderings:
put
thou
my
tears
into
thy
bottle:
are
they
not
in
thy
book?
056:009
When
I
cry
unto
thee,
then
shall
mine
enemies
turn
back:
this
I
know;
for
God
is
for
me.
056:010
In
God
will
I
praise
his
word:
in
the
LORD
will
I
praise
his
word.
056:011
In
God
have
I
put
my
trust:
I
will
not
be
afraid
what
man
can
do
unto
me.
056:012
Thy
vows
are
upon
me,
O
God:
I
will
render
praises
unto
thee.
056:013
For
thou
hast
delivered
my
soul
from
death:
wilt
not
thou
deliver
my
feet
from
falling,
that
I
may
walk
before
God
in
the
light
of
the
living?
057:001
Be
merciful
unto
me,
O
God,
be
merciful
unto
me:
for
my
soul
trusteth
in
thee:
yea,
in
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
will
I
make
my
refuge,
until
these
calamities
be
overpast.
057:002
I
will
cry
unto
God
most
high;
unto
God
that
performeth
all
things
for
me.
057:003
He
shall
send
from
heaven,
and
save
me
from
the
reproach
of
him
that
would
swallow
me
up.
Selah.
God
shall
send
forth
his
mercy
and
his
truth.
057:004
My
soul
is
among
lions:
and
I
lie
even
among
them
that
are
set
on
fire,
even
the
sons
of
men,
whose
teeth
are
spears
and
arrows,
and
their
tongue
a
sharp
sword.
057:005
Be
thou
exalted,
O
God,
above
the
heavens;
let
thy
glory
be
above
all
the
earth.
057:006
They
have
prepared
a
net
for
my
steps;
my
soul
is
bowed
down:
they
have
digged
a
pit
before
me,
into
the
midst
whereof
they
are
fallen
themselves.
Selah.
057:007
My
heart
is
fixed,
O
God,
my
heart
is
fixed:
I
will
sing
and
give
praise.
057:008
Awake
up,
my
glory;
awake,
psaltery
and
harp:
I
myself
will
awake
early.
057:009
I
will
praise
thee,
O
Lord,
among
the
people:
I
will
sing
unto
thee
among
the
nations.
057:010
For
thy
mercy
is
great
unto
the
heavens,
and
thy
truth
unto
the
clouds.
057:011
Be
thou
exalted,
O
God,
above
the
heavens:
let
thy
glory
be
above
all
the
earth.
058:001
Do
ye
indeed
speak
righteousness,
O
congregation?
do
ye
judge
uprightly,
O
ye
sons
of
men?
058:002
